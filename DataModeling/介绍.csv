C. Chang) was a collector and dealer who owned Tonying & Company, an antiquities shop in Paris. He emigrated to New York in 1939, where he continued to collect. Zhang worked for C. T. Loo & Company in New York, and later Oriental Fine Arts, which was owned by Arthur B. Rothwell (see note 2). In a letter to Laurence Sickman, Nelson-Atkins Director, dated November 18, 1960, Rothwell described how he came to own the oracle bones: “The inscribed bones, etc. were in the collection of my late associate, Mr. Chang Nai-Chi and were acquired by me from his estate. His death, of course, was so sudden that no provisions had been made for obtaining much of the information that was required later regarding both his personal and also the gallery collection. I am afraid I have no knowledge of the date or place of acquisition but many of his archaic jades and other pieces were obtained during his long purchasing visit to China in 1947 and again in 1948.” Nelson-Atkins Archives, RG 02 Department of Asian Art Records, box 6, folder 2.[2] Arthur B. Rothwell was born in Oldham, England in 1906 and worked as an import manager for Yangtze Trading Company during his early career. He spent several years in New York as president of Oriental Fine Arts, Inc., until 1949, when he closed the gallery and moved to Panama. By 1959, he lived in Dallas, Texas, where he was involved in the oil industry with the Cheyenne Oil Corporation. In a letter to Laurence Sickman dated October 25, 1960, Rothwell proposed an exchange in which he would trade his collection of carved bone fragments for a redundant object from the Nelson-Atkins collection. The object traded by the Nelson-Atkins was a Ting ware cup, which had been purchased by the Museum through Sickman in 1935. The newly-acquired oracle bones assumed the Ting ware cup’s accession number of 35-115. Nelson-Atkins Archives, RG 02 Department of Asian Art Records, box 6, folder 2."

C. Chang) was a collector and dealer who owned Tonying & Company, an antiquities shop in Paris. He emigrated to New York in 1939, where he continued to collect. Zhang worked for C. T. Loo & Company in New York, and later Oriental Fine Arts, which was owned by Arthur B. Rothwell (see note 2). In a letter to Laurence Sickman, Nelson-Atkins Director, dated November 18, 1960, Rothwell described how he came to own the oracle bones: “The inscribed bones, etc. were in the collection of my late associate, Mr. Chang Nai-Chi and were acquired by me from his estate. His death, of course, was so sudden that no provisions had been made for obtaining much of the information that was required later regarding both his personal and also the gallery collection. I am afraid I have no knowledge of the date or place of acquisition but many of his archaic jades and other pieces were obtained during his long purchasing visit to China in 1947 and again in 1948.” Nelson-Atkins Archives, RG 02 Department of Asian Art Records, box 6, folder 2.[2] Arthur B. Rothwell was born in Oldham, England in 1906 and worked as an import manager for Yangtze Trading Company during his early career. He spent several years in New York as president of Oriental Fine Arts, Inc., until 1949, when he closed the gallery and moved to Panama. By 1959, he lived in Dallas, Texas, where he was involved in the oil industry with the Cheyenne Oil Corporation. In a letter to Laurence Sickman dated October 25, 1960, Rothwell proposed an exchange in which he would trade his collection of carved bone fragments for a redundant object from the Nelson-Atkins collection. The object traded by the Nelson-Atkins was a Ting ware cup, which had been purchased by the Museum through Sickman in 1935. The newly-acquired oracle bones assumed the Ting ware cup’s accession number of 35-115. Nelson-Atkins Archives, RG 02 Department of Asian Art Records, box 6, folder 2."

C. Chang) was a collector and dealer who owned Tonying & Company, an antiquities shop in Paris. He emigrated to New York in 1939, where he continued to collect. Zhang worked for C. T. Loo & Company in New York, and later Oriental Fine Arts, which was owned by Arthur B. Rothwell (see note 2). In a letter to Laurence Sickman, Nelson-Atkins Director, dated November 18, 1960, Rothwell described how he came to own the oracle bones: “The inscribed bones, etc. were in the collection of my late associate, Mr. Chang Nai-Chi and were acquired by me from his estate. His death, of course, was so sudden that no provisions had been made for obtaining much of the information that was required later regarding both his personal and also the gallery collection. I am afraid I have no knowledge of the date or place of acquisition but many of his archaic jades and other pieces were obtained during his long purchasing visit to China in 1947 and again in 1948.” Nelson-Atkins Archives, RG 02 Department of Asian Art Records, box 6, folder 2.[2] Arthur B. Rothwell was born in Oldham, England in 1906 and worked as an import manager for Yangtze Trading Company during his early career. He spent several years in New York as president of Oriental Fine Arts, Inc., until 1949, when he closed the gallery and moved to Panama. By 1959, he lived in Dallas, Texas, where he was involved in the oil industry with the Cheyenne Oil Corporation. In a letter to Laurence Sickman dated October 25, 1960, Rothwell proposed an exchange in which he would trade his collection of carved bone fragments for a redundant object from the Nelson-Atkins collection. The object traded by the Nelson-Atkins was a Ting ware cup, which had been purchased by the Museum through Sickman in 1935. The newly-acquired oracle bones assumed the Ting ware cup’s accession number of 35-115. Nelson-Atkins Archives, RG 02 Department of Asian Art Records, box 6, folder 2."

Guqin_(古琴_),"Many Ming-dynasty princes, starting with the sons of the founder and continuing until the last generation before the dynasty's fall in the mid-seventeenth century, were accomplished musicians, and some made important contributions to musicology and musical theory. The first prince of Lu (1568–1614), brother of Emperor Shenzhong (Wanli), was an immensely rich man, and hundreds of qin were made for his household and descendants in the last years of the Ming dynasty. Zhu Changfang (1608-1646), the last prince of Lu, commissioned hundreds of guqin . All bear the inscription of the Princedom of Lu, and all are numbered. About ten Prince Lu qin are extant; the one in the Metropolitan Museum, number 18, dated 1634, is the earliest. The highest-numbered Prince Lu qin known is number 295. It is dated 1644, the year the Ming dynasty came to an end.The back of the Museum's qin bears the maker's seal and date, the words ""Capital Peace,"" and a twenty-character poem by Jingyi Zhuren (d. 1670) that reads:The moonlight is being reflected by the river YangziA light breeze is blowing over clear dewdrops,Only in a tranquil placeCan one comprehend the feeling of eternity.Endowed with cosmological and metaphysical significance and empowered to communicate the deepest feelings, the qin, beloved of sages and of Confucius, is the most prestigious instrument in China. Han-dynasty writers state that the qin helped to cultivate character, understand morality, supplicate gods and demons, enhance life, and enrich learning. Ming-dynasty literati who claimed the right to play the qin suggested that it be played outdoors in a mountain setting, a garden, a small pavillion, or near an old pine tree (symbol of longevity) while burning incense to perfume the air. A serene moonlit night was considered an appropriate time for performance. Each part of the instrument is identified by an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic name and cosmology is ever present: for example, the upper board of wutong wood symbolizes heaven, the bottom board of zi wood symbolizes earth. Qins over a hundred years old are considered best, the age determined by the pattern of cracks (duanwen) in the lacquer. The thirteen studs (hui) indicate finger positions. Strings of varying thicknesses are made of twisted silk."
Archer's_Ring_(清___扳指),"In Manchu archery, the bowstring is pulled back with the thumb of the right hand, making a thumb ring essential both to protect the thumb and to ensure a smooth release of the arrow. In addition to their practical function, thumb rings were also worn regularly as personal adornment. All Manchu archers, even the highest ranking aristocrats, favored plain thumb rings of bone or antler for use in hunting and warfare. At other times, however, they wore thumb rings that were highly decorated and made of fragile or precious materials, such as jade, amber or ivory.This ring is inscribed with a line of poetry by Su Shi (1037–1101), a major figure of the Song dynasty, and the name of the ivory carver:The chirping swallows from the eminent Xie family gather at the magnificent hall. Carved by Wen Zhao."
Goqing,"Carefully incised veins suggest a downwardly curving lotus leaf of dark nephrite jade. The goqing once sounded to announce the arrival and rank of a guest or to denote the length of a pause following the completion of a musical piece. The great importance of sonorous substances, such as wood and stones, among the percussion instruments of the Far East stems from the religious belief that nature itself speaks to the human ear through this vibrating matter."
Pipa_(琵琶_),"The pear-shaped lute slowly migrated from Central Asia into China during the Han and Sui dynasties (1st-7th century). It eventually became the pipa; the term describes the original playing motion of the plectrum held in the performer's right hand: p'i, ""to play forward"" (toward the left), and p'a, ""to play backward"" (toward the right). Until the mid-tenth century, the pipa was held horizontally (guitar style), and its twisted silk strings were plucked with a large triangular plectrum. Toward the end of the Tang dynasty, musicians began using their fingernails to execute the exuberant and programmatic repertory that was gaining popularity and that became the national style. To facilitate the use of the fingers, the instrument began to be held in a more upright position. In addition to its use in the opera and in storytelling ensembles, the pipa has a solo repertory of highly programmatic, virtuosic music.The spectacular back and sides of this unique Ming-dynasty instrument feature more than 110 hexagonal ivory plaques, with thinner bone plaques on the neck. Each plaque is carved with Taoist, Confucian, or Buddhist figures and symbols signifying prosperity, happiness, and good luck. These include images of various gods and immortals, such as Shou Lao, the Daoist god of longevity, who is shown with a prominent forehead on the single plaque at the very top. When the instrument is played, this expert workmanship remains unseen by the listener, as the back faces the player. The front is relatively plain but shows signs of use. The ivory string holder bears a scene featuring four figures and a bridge; an archaic cursive inscription; and, at the lip, a bat motif with leafy tendrils. Above the lower frets, two small insets depict a spider and a bird, and just before the rounded upper frets, a trapezoidal plaque portrays two men, one with a fish. The finial repeats the bat (good luck) motif."
Dung-Chen,"Although Confucianism remained the basis for the structure of government in China, it was Buddhism, introduced in the first century B.C.E., which flourished from the Han to the Tang (206 B.C.E.–C.E. 907). Among the instruments associated with Buddhism was the dung-chen, a long trumpet played for preludes, processions, and morning and evening calls to prayer. It was unusual for musical instruments to be enameled; cloisonné was usually reserved for containers, such as boxes or vases. This Tibetan-style long trumpet was among the many instruments made in China and sent as gifts to impress officials of bordering nations. Gifts of musical instruments and the musicians who played them were common in east Asia. This political custom promoted the dissemination of musical ideas. The dung-chen, like many Asian trumpets, collapses for storage."
Saddle_(清____馬鞍一套),"In terms of quality and style of workmanship this saddle is extremely similar to some of the best imperial Chinese saddles, such as one owned by the emperor Qianlong (r. 1736–96) and preserved in the Palace Museum, Beijing (G.171546). In addition to its very high quality, this saddle is also exceptional for having all of its original parts, including the elaborate seat cover of embroidered silk and the fittings of the saddletree. Although this type of saddle is often identified as Tibetan, the form of the saddle plates, the style of workmanship, and the type of saddletree, along with the similarity to imperial Chinese saddles, indicate it is more likely to be Chinese, perhaps from the imperial workshops. That it was used in Tibet, however, is demonstrated by the Tibetan letterka, which is branded on the underside of the saddletree as a form of inventory number. It must have belonged to a Tibetan nobleman of the highest rank, possibly received as a gift directly from the imperial court. The saddle plates are made from relatively thick iron, deeply chiseled and pierced, the motifs densely arranged so that the gaps in the scrollwork are narrow. The plates are finely crosshatched and damascened overall with a thick layer of gold foil. The beads of coral and ivory in the center of the pommel and cantle are popular Buddhist symbols called the Three Jewels, representing Buddha, Dharma (Buddhist teachings), and Sangha (the community of believers)."
Sword_with_Scabbard_Mounts,"This sword is said to have been found in an imperial tomb at Mang Shan, north of Luoyang, Henan Province. The ring pommel encloses a phoenix head."

Imperial_Seal_of_the_Prince_of_the_D?rbed_(Four_Children)_Banner,"The Qing emperors consolidated their rule over Inner Mongolia by recognizing the title of prince held by leaders of various Mongol fiefdoms. These fiefdoms were then organized into territorial units known as banners. In return for their loyalty and military support, the princes received full and inalienable rights to rule their banners in alliance with the Qing. To signify that power and authority, the emperor gave each prince a silver seal, surviving examples of which are now exceptionally rare. These imperial seals were inherited by successive princes and venerated as sacred objects, while also embodying the banner’s status and legitimacy within the empire.Emperor Kangxi (reigned 1662–1722) bestowed this seal on the leader of the D?rbed (Four Children) Banner to formalize the banner’s acceptance of Qing sovereignty in 1686. On the underside of the base of this seal, cast in raised letters, is the phrase, in Manchu and Mongolian, Seal of the Prince of the D?rbed Banner. The same phrase is also engraved on top of the base at either side of the tiger, in Manchu on one side and Mongolian on the other. The dual language inscription, Made by the State Ministry, is engraved on the front and back edges of the base; and, Kangxi twenty-fifth year, fourth month [a.d. 1686] is engraved on the side edges of the base."
Archer's_Ring_with_Taoist_Symbols_(清___扳指),"In Manchu archery, the bowstring is pulled back with the thumb of the right hand, making a thumb ring essential both to protect the thumb and to ensure a smooth release of the arrow. In addition to their practical function, thumb rings were also worn regularly as personal adornment. All Manchu archers, even the highest ranking aristocrats, favored plain thumb rings of bone or antler for use in hunting and warfare. At other times, however, they wore thumb rings that were highly decorated and made of fragile or precious materials, such as jade, amber or ivory.Each of this ring's four panels is carved with symbols representing one of the Eight Immortals and one of the Eight Precious Objects of Taoism."
Sword_with_Scabbard_Mounts,"This sword is said to have been found in an imperial tomb at Mang Shan, north of Luoyang, Henan Province. The P-shaped scabbard mounts, probably derived from long swords worn by nomadic Sarmatian and Sasanian horsemen, served as a prototype for the Japanesetachi(slung sword). The ring pommel takes the form of two confronted dragons."
Sword,"In its complete state, this excavated bronze sword would have included an integral disk-shaped pommel positioned perpendicularly to the axis of the grip. The double-edged blade bears on one side an inscription that seemingly records the circumstances of the sword's manufacture. However, the execution of the writing suggests that the inscription is either a modern addition or an original text that was defaced when the original characters were engraved over in a misguided attempt to make them clearer."
Ceremonial_Helmet,"The excellent quality and elaborate ornamentation of this helmet indicate that it was made for a nobleman, possibly of imperial status, or a very high-ranking military official. It is decorated with applied ornaments of gilt copper including the Buddhist mantraOm mani padme humin Lantsa characters. The Lantsa alphabet was often used for sacred inscriptions in Tibet, China, and other Buddhist countries. The helmet is very similar to one worn by Emperor Qianlong in a famous equestrian portrait of him painted by the Jesuit artist, Giuseppe Castiglione, and another helmet that was donated by the emperor to a Tibetan monastery in 1757."
Imperial_Knife_with_Sheath,"This elegant knife was intended as a personal accessory for a member of the imperial court, rather than as a weapon. It is part of a group of several known examples, all of which are similar in shape, size, and richness, but with each having some differences, particularly in the style and decoration of the sheaths. The gilding of their blades is a distinctive and highly unusual feature; the steel beneath the gold is purposely roughened to create a mottled, naturalistic surface to contrast with the refined precision of the accompanying hilt and sheath. At the base of the spine of the blade, the Qianlong mark is inlaid in gold letters:Qianlong nian zhi(Made in the Qianlong reign). The decoration on the sheath imitates European gold and enamel work."

The decoration on the sheath is an inspired interpretation of Islamic ornament."
Imperial_Saddle_and_Stirrups_with_Bridle,"Skillful horsemanship played a vital role in the military successes of the Manchu and was a key factor in the establishment of the Qing dynasty. Because of this, riding and the use of weapons on horseback for warfare or hunting became important aspects of Qing cultural identity. Elaborately decorated saddles were one highly visible way that Qing emperors and the military elite celebrated their equestrian heritage.The visible areas of this saddle are covered entirely with carved red lacquer. This expensive and time-consuming technique was normally restricted to objects such as dishes and small boxes, which were luxury items made to be appreciated for their beauty and delicacy. Its use on a saddle, even one intended only for ceremonial purposes, is unprecedented and conveys the great wealth, taste, and refinement of its original owner. It is possible that this saddle was made in the imperial Palace Workshops (Zaoban chu), one of which was devoted solely to the production of saddles for the emperor.In addition to their utilitarian function, stirrups, like saddles, were often beatifully decorated. Nearly all stirrups from China, Mongolia, and Tibet incorporated dragon heads into their design on either side of the slot at the center of the arch. This pair is very unusual for its lack of dragons and for its simple but elegant ornament, formed by a pattern of closely set, five-petal flower blossoms."
Pair_of_Dagger-Axes_(Ge),"This pair of dagger-axes (ge) represent a later developmental stage, in which the three principal elements––yuan,hu, andnui––became longer and more slender in proportion, their edges describing both gentle curves and perfectly straight edges in a balanced juxtaposition. This refinement coincided with the decline of thegeas the foremost of offensive weapons toward the end of the Western Han dynasty. The delicate painted lacquer decoration further emphasizes the ornamental function of these pieces and suggests that they may have been made purely for ceremonial use or specifically as grave goods for the tomb of a high ranking military official."
Matchlock_Gun_with_Carved_Red_Lacquer_Stock,"Although typical in its form, this gun is extraordinary, possibly unique, for its decoration, consisting of deeply carved red lacquer covering the entire gunstock and featuring designs of undulating dragons among billowing clouds. This painstaking, delicate, and expensive lacquer technique is usually found on dishes, boxes, and other types of lacquerware intended as presentation pieces or to be appreciated as works of art. Additional ornament is visible on the gun barrel, which is finely engraved along its length with images of dragons and leafy vines.China pioneered the use of gunpowder for fireworks and artillery in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Sophisticated firearms technology, however, developed more rapidly in Europe during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and was then introduced into China by merchants, diplomats, and missionaries during the seventeenth century. Improved designs for cannons and practical types of hand-held guns were eagerly promoted and officially adopted as regulation military equipment under the Qing emperors Kangxi (reigned 1662–1722) and Qianlong (reigned 1736–1795). In addition to mastering the use of bow and arrow and other weapons, both Kangxi and Qianlong owned and used guns, particularly for hunting. This was in keeping with their overall belief in the importance of martial training, which they encouraged by personal example."
Ceremonial_Saddle,"The intensely intricate designs that cover this saddle are made of small, microscopically thin pieces of abalone shell (commonly called mother of pearl) and gold foil set into a background of black lacquer. Like the carved red lacquer seen on the saddle and gun displayed nearby, this technique was usually reserved for delicate luxury objects such as plates, boxes, or folding screens.For centuries, elaborately decorated saddles were used across Asia, from Japan to the Himalayas, as personal status symbols and as diplomatic gifts. Based on its quality and rarity, this saddle may have been made in the imperial Palace Workshops (Zaoban chu), one of which was devoted specifically to saddlery. Discovered in Tibet in the 1980s, the saddle was probably sent there from China in the seventeenth or eighteenth century as a gift from the imperial court."
Swords_with_Scabbard_Mounts,"This sword is said to have been found in an imperial tomb at Mang Shan, north of Luoyang, Henan Province. The ring pommel encloses a phoenix head."
Small_wine_pot_or_teapot,"This small, squat, pear-shaped pot has an eared handle and a curved spout. A design of flowers and rocks is painted on either side. The quality of the blue is unusually good for wares of this type; indeed, it approximates the blue seen in mid-sixteenth-century Chinese porcelains. The character yu (jade) is written in underglaze blue, with no encircling element, on the base. The chipped spout has been repaired."
Small_vase,"This vase forms a pair with another in the Robert Lehman Collection (1975.1.1688), which rather clumsily follows the archaic bronze zun shape. The pieces are covered with a deep red glaze that shades to white at the bottom. Both mouths have been cut, and they are bound with metal rims."

Figure_of_lion_mounted_as_lamp,"This Buddhist lion mounted as a lamp forms a pair with another in the Lehman Collection (1975.1.1728). The lions sit on high plinths, which have a removable drawer. The animals — 1975.1.1728 is the female with her cub, and 1975.1.1729 is the male with his traditional brocaded ball — are decorated in green, yellow, and white glazes. They are fairly well modeled and display a certain amount of animation. The condition is good, except for repairs to the ears in both pieces."
Small_covered_wine_pot_or_teapot,"This small, pear-shaped vessel, similar to three others in the Robert Lehman Collection (1975.1.15-17), has eared handles and curving spouts. The lids may be original to the pots. The pots and lids are painted in a linear style with classic scrolls and pendant petal-panels containing floral motifs, along with both pendant and upright leaf forms. The character yu (jade) is written in underglaze blue, with no encircling element, on each of the bases. The bodies of these four vessels are a bit softer than that of the similar piece 1975.1.1718, and the glazes are creamier in tone. There are chips on the vessels."
Hexagonal_wine_pot_or_teapot,"This hexagonal vessels forms a pair with another in the Robert Lehman Collection (1975.1.1707). They have eared handles and short curving spouts; the hexagonal domed lids are probably original. A honeycomb-and-flower motif is pierced into each facet of the bodies; the lids are also reticulated. The vessels are painted with flowers and diaper patterns in overglaze pink, bright yellow, purple, brown, green, and lavender-blue; there is some enameling-on-enamels as well. The technique of painting enamel designs on top of other enamels probably began in the late eighteenth century. The spout of 1975.1.1707 has been broken and now has a metal cap that is attached to the lid with a chain."

The spout of 1975.1.1707 has been broken and now has a metal cap that is attached to the lid with a chain."
Twelve_animals_of_the_Chinese_zodiac,"The twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac are popular decorative motifs that appear in various media. This set, made of flawless pale green jade, would have been especially prized. Qing-dynasty master carvers individualized each animal with distinctive accessories and varied postures. The snake, for example, sits calmly with his hands in long, loose sleeves. This set is from the collection of Heber R. Bishop."
Tánggǔ_(堂鼓),"The tone and volume of this double-headed barrel drum can be varied by striking the oxhide nearer or farther from the center or rim. Used in theatrical performances or Buddhist rituals, drums similar to this one, suspended in a frame or on poles, have held a place in Chinese music since the Shang dynasty. Newer adaptations of the tanggu are now used in the modern Chinese orchestra."
Dizi,"In addition to the blowhole (right) and finger holes, the dizi has an extra hole between the finger holes and blowhole that is covered by a membrane or a tissue-thin piece of bamboo that produces a poignant buzzing tone. There may also be a number of vent holes at the end from which tassels are frequently hung and poems may be inscribed on the flute as an additional decoration. Dizi are usually made of bamboo, but more durable materials, such as marble or, as in this case, jade, may be used. This flute, like other dizi, could be used in solo performance or in the kungu opera, one of the styles contributing to Beijing opera."
Chairman_Mao,"During his thirty-three-year reign, Mao Zedong’s personality cult was fortified by a series of official portraits in which the aging visage of the Great Leader was painstakingly retouched to project an image of flawless benevolence. This portrait served as the frontispiece to Quotations from Chairman Mao, known in the West as the “Little Red Book,” and was omnipresent in the Chinese landscape during the waning years of the Cultural Revolution. The image achieved fame outside China when Andy Warhol used it as the basis of a series of silkscreens in 1973."
Wine_warmer_(Jue),"Every ancient Chinese bronze thus far discovered was cast using a complex pottery section-mold—a Chinese invention. But this vessel’s shape—angular, with a thin-walled body, a rim that appears “folded over,” and a “strap” handle—implies an earlier hammered sheet-metal mode of manufacture that might have been introduced from western Asia, where bronze metallurgy developed two thousand years before it appeared in China."
E-pa,"Performers find that new, sleek, and uniquely shaped instruments are not only visually striking and ergonomic, but are capable of effects and nuances not realized on their acoustic counterparts. The late twentieth-century e-pa, based on the traditional Chinese lute (pipa), like other adaptations, has sparked the creativity of musicians, recording artists, and composers."
Snaffle_Bit,"The domestication of the horse was a major turning point in human history. For agriculture but also warfare the possession of a horse provided undeniable material advantages. The bits adopted by early riders to control the animal were initially made of organic materials such as horn and bone. With the advent of metallurgy, bits were increasingly made of cast bronze and iron. This snaffle bit is remarkable for the presence of ornament on the branches, which takes the form of a pattern of scales."
Soup_Plate,"Chinese export porcelain was one of the luxuries deemed essential to a well-appointed eighteenth-century house. Until 1784, when direct trade began between China and America, Chinese porcelain came to the colonies by way of Europe. This soup plate was part of a large service that descended in the Verplanck family of New York."

Figure_of_a_European_Merchant,"The figure is notable for the very high quality of the modeling of the face and wig, for the richly detailed costume, and especially for the impression it conveys of a specific individual. This is not a generic portrait of a European but rather a detailed likeness of a foreign merchant working in China, observed first hand. His affluence and status are conveyed by the fashionable clothes he wears, most specifically by the waistcoat painted to look like silk interwoven with gold metallic threads."

Sword_(Ral_gri),"This is one of the best examples from a small group of rare early swords from Tibet. The hilt of this sword, including its grip, is made entirely of iron that has been embossed, chiseled, and then damascened in gold and silver. The guard, just below the grip, is in the form of a stylized mask with teeth and fangs, representing a protective deity or guardian figure. Straight double-edged blades of this type are seen more often on Chinese swords, but they were also used in Tibet."
Se_(瑟_),"Said to represent friendship and love when played together with the qin, the se, with its movable bridges, is plucked with both hands. This technique, unusual for Asian zithers, permits the player to sound the strings in octaves. Twenty-five multicolored silk strings reflect Chinese cosmology: five are blue, for Heaven, the Azure Dragon of the East; five are red, the luckiest color, associated with the South; four are yellow, for the Earth; the bridgeless white string is not played and symbolizes the West, space, and mourning; five are purple, an imperial color; and five are black, for the North. Se, such as this one from a Taoist temple, were used in rituals and at state ceremonies. Here, inscriptions indicate both the maker, Fanfu Lou, and the owner: ""Treasure collection [of] Monk Xinzhu."""
Xiao,"The jade flute appeared in Chinese literature at a very early date. However, it was not until the eighteenth century, when the supply of the precious stone was plentiful, that jade flutes were actually made."
Sanxian_(三弦_),"There are two forms of the sanxian: a large one from the North, with a thin metal plate attached inside to enrich the sound, and a smaller version from the South. Like the pipa, the sanxian may accompany narrative song, changing its tuning to accommodate the singer. The bat decorating the finials of this instrument is a symbol of good fortune and appears on many Chinese objects."
Covered_Punch_Bowl,"This monumental punchbowl, with its original cover and platter, must have been one of the most ambitious porcelains to grace an American colonial household. We can only speculate as to how the bowl, the decoration of which indicates that it was made for the Swedish market, found its way to a prominent Charleston family during the eighteenth century. It was listed among the effects of Mary Brandford Bull, upon her death in 1772, as ""1 large China Bowl Dish & Cover."" The Bulls, one of Charleston's wealthiest families, lived in the grand style. Through the four daughters, the bowl descended in the family and ended up in Philadelphia by 1790. The detailed painted scene on the platter is based on a 1691 engraving of the Swedish Chateau of L?ck?, on Lake V?nern. Two other Swedish chateaus drawn from earlier print sources are represented on the bowl; the cover features two Swedish churches in a landscape with huntsmen, fishermen, and sailors."
Sanxian_(三弦_),"There are two main forms of the sanxian: a large one from the North, with a thin metal plate attached inside to enrich the sound; and a smaller version from the South. Like the pipa, the sanxian may accompany narrative song, changing its tuning to accommodate the singer. The bat decorating the finials of these instruments is depicted on many Chinese objects and is a symbol of good luck."
Monteith,"Used to chill wineglasses, these stylized bowls were first brought west from China in the late seventeenth century. After the monteith was filled with cold water, each glass could be hung by its foot from a notch in the monteith’s rim, so that the bowl of every glass was submerged. The English name for the device is said to come from a “fantastical Scot” named Monteigh, who favored a cloak with scalloped edges to attract attention."
Guqin_(古琴_),"Endowed with cosmological and metaphysical significance and empowered to communicate the deepest feelings, this zither, beloved of sages and of Confucius, is the most prestigious instrument in China. Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.) writers state that the qin helped to cultivate character, understand morality, supplicate gods and demons, enhance life, and enrich learning. Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) literati who claimed the right to play the qin suggested that it be played outdoors in a mountain setting, a garden or a small pavilion or near an old pine tree (symbol of longevity) while burning incense perfumed the air. A serene moonlit night was considered an appropriate time for performance. Each part of the instrument is identified by an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic name and cosmology is ever present: for example, the upper board of wutong wood symbolizes heaven, the bottom board of zi wood symbolizes earth. Qins over a hundred years old are considered best, the age determined by the pattern of cracks (duanwen) in the lacquer. The 13 studs (hui) indicate finger positions. Strings of varying thicknesses are traditionally made of twisted silk."
Pipa_(琵琶_),"The term pipa has been known since the 3rd century B.C. It originally described the playing motion of the right hand: p'i, ""to play forward"" (left), and p'a, ""to play backward"" (right). In addition to its use in the opera and in story telling ensembles, the pipa has a solo repertoire of highly programmatic, virtuosic music."
Dung_Chen,"Although Confucianism remained the basis for the structure of government in China, it was Buddhism, introduced in the first century B.C.E., which flourished from the Han to the Tang (206 B.C.E.–C.E. 907). Among the instruments associated with Buddhism was the dung-chen, a long trumpet played for preludes, processions, and morning and evening calls to prayer. It was unusual for musical instruments to be enameled; cloisonné was usually reserved for containers, such as boxes or vases. This Tibetan-style long trumpet was among the many instruments made in China and sent as gifts to impress officials of bordering nations. Gifts of musical instruments and the musicians who played them were common in east Asia. This political custom promoted the dissemination of musical ideas. The dung-chen, like many Asian trumpets, collapses for storage."
Sheng_(_笙_),"Southeast Asian in origin and used before the twelfth century b.c., the sheng played an important role in Confucian music. Now it accompanies folk songs and is occasionally used in the Beijing opera to add harmony. The arrangement of its bamboo pipes symbolizes the folded wings of the mythical phoenix, whose cry the sheng’s sound is said to represent."
Pipa_(琵琶_),"The term pipa has been known since the third century b.c. It originally described the playing motion of the right hand: pi, ""to play forward"" (left), and pa, ""to play backward"" (right). Since the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the pipa has been used in operatic and narrative-singing ensembles and has a solo repertoire of highly programmatic, virtuosic music."
Xiao,"Bamboo is the typical material for end-blown flutes, but special decorative ones have sometimes been produced. This molded porcelain tube, marked ""Lin Chao Jing,"" mimics bamboo and is decorated at each end with a vegetal meander, a ""Greek key"" pattern, and a leaf design. That the instrument is playable is remarkable, as probably only one out of two hundred fired would sound correctly."
Yangqin_(揚琴_),"This dulcimer is found in orchestras and small ensembles but is more at home in the regional opera of Guangzhou (Canton). Evidence suggests that the yangqin first appeared in the southeastern province of Guandong during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), indicating diffusion by sea from the Middle East rather than by the usual overland Silk Road. Unlike plucked lutes, which have silk or nylon strings of varying thicknesses, the yangqin has strings of copper or steel, which are beaten with flexible bamboo hammers."
Guanzi_(管子_),"This double-reed pipe is most frequently played for funerals, weddings, regional opera, temple and folk music. The simple cylindrical hardwood tube has a wider melodic range and is a much older instrument type than the conical suona. The guanzi is often replaced today by the saxophone."
Suona_(嗩吶_),"Double-reed instruments first appeared during the late Han dynasty, having originated in the Middle East. The term suona derives from zurna, the Arabic name for the instrument. It is depicted, along with many other instruments, in images created from the third to the fifth century in the Buddhist cave temples at Kizil. The penetrating sound of the suona, ideal for processions and military functions, was easily appropriated for popular music. Several varieties are found in China, including a smaller version called a haidi. The player, whose mouth completely covers the small reeds, uses circular breathing (inhaling through the nose) to maintain a constant tone."
"""Xiangpu’s_Treasure""_Guqin_(古琴_)","The quqin (ancient zither), China’s ancient and venerated 7-stringed zither, during its long history has taken several forms. For many, the double-waisted profile of the classic “Confucian style"" qin is the most familiar of the twelve or so that appear. This example known as a ""banana leaf style"" ( 焦葉) or Jiaoye pattern, is a popular variation taking its name from its undulating sides. Other construction elements like the 13 mother-of-pearl buttons (hui) that indicate finger positions remain the same. Two inscriptions, one referencing the owner's discovery of the instrument in 1872 and its restoration, the other relating the story of Zhong Ziqi and Yu Boya appear on the back along with a seal bearing the instrument's name, ""Xiangpu's Treasure""."
Dizi_(笛子_),"In addition to a blowhole and finger holes, the dizi, also known as di, has an extra hole covered with a membrane stripped from the inner layer of a bamboo stalk. This membrane, technically a mirliton, provides the flute with a poignant buzzing tone and helps to amplify the sound. There may also be a number of vent holes at the end, from which tassels are frequently hung. Dizi such as this one were used in kunqu opera, one of the styles that contributed to the development of Beijing opera. The two lines of poetry inscribed on this flute are from ""An Autumn Night in a Moonlight Dwelling,"" by the Tang poet Wang Wei (699-761): Bright moon shines in the pines/ Clear stream flows over rocks. The instrument is signed by the calligrapher and/or carver, Wen Shan."
Huqin,"Two-stringed fiddles (huqin) were introduced into China by nomadic Mongols during the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368). (The presence of ""hu"" in the name of an instrument indicates that it was a foreign import.) Bow hairs passing between the huqin's strings may reflect the Mongol's need to secure the bow to his instrument while on horseback. Huqin are played vertically on the knee, fingered with the left hand and bowed with the right. In earlier times, there existed a greater variety of local fiddles, but today, as with the European family of violins, certain standard sizes prevail.Although this nineteenth-century example has an hourglass-shaped body, the erhu more typically has a round or hexagonal sound box and a snakeskin belly. It is heard in traditional ensembles, modern orchestras, and solo performances. In the opera, it either doubles the melody of a higher-pitched fiddle (jinghu) an octave lower or accompanies female roles. In southern China and Taiwan, it is known as the nanhu."
"Yunluo_(雲鑼_)""Cloud_Gong""","The yunluo consists of ten tuned bronze gongs of varying thicknesses, which provide different pitches when struck with a small mallet. First cited in the early fourteenth century, this instrument was originally used at court and in Confucian ceremonies, but by the eighteenth century, it was also found at private rituals such as weddings and funerals. By the mid-twentieth century, it had been incorporated into large orchestras and was enlarged to twenty-four or more gongs struck with two mallets."
Sihu_(四胡_),"Two stringed bowed lutes (huqin) were introduced to China by nomadic Mongols sometime during the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368). Bow hairs passing between the strings may reflect the Mongol's need to secure the bow to the instrument while on horseback. Huqin are played vertically on the knee, fingered with the left hand and bowed with the right. In earlier times there existed a greater variety of local fiddles, but today standard sizes, much like the European family of violins, are most common.This four string fiddle appears occasionally in the opera but is more closely associated with drum songs, along with sanxian, pipa, and yangqin."
Flower_Basket,"In China the peony is a symbol of nobility and prosperity. Prints of this kind were often presented as gifts in the form of single sheets or in sets conveying good wishes. The poetic couplet, which extols the beauty of the flowers, is followed by a signature that identifies the producer of this print as a member of the Ding family workshop in Suzhou."
After_Rain,"In this print the colorful roofs of the ancient Forbidden City in Beijing stand out against the city’s skyline, dominated by high-rise buildings under construction. A rainbow shines through the dark storm clouds like a benign revelation. The work reflects the rapid modernization and surging optimism for a better future stimulated by China’s reform policy in the 1980s.Zhang Peiyi, an artist and teacher based in Beijing, is best known for his prints in water-soluble ink."
Storm_on_the_Embankment,"In this dramatic composition Chen Jinrong depicts a tempest above the construction site of a dam. Glistening water, barely held back by a monumental embankment, dramatizes the uncertainty of whether the forces of nature can be contained by advances in human technology."
Chinese_Poem_on_Zen_Meditation,"Feiyin Tongrong was a Chinese monk who advocated a reassessment of Chan (Zen) practice and its transmission through history, asserting the superiority of the Linji (Rinzai) sect over that of the Caodong (Sōtō). Although he spent his entire life in China, his disciples traveled to Japan, where they established Manpukuji Temple as the center for promoting Feiyin’s ideas. This poem, inscribed in cursive script, conveys Feiyin’s wish to impart his teachings:参禅参到獨知時 得意分明挙似誰但看普天秋月夜 一輪彌満照前渓I’ve done Zen meditation to the pointwhere I alone get it;Understanding and clarity,to whom might I pass this on?All I see on this night of the autumn moonis how it fills the heavens,A single wheel effulgentlyilluminating the stream before me.—Adapted from Jonathan Chaves"
Fruit_Plate,"The luxurious arrangement of fruit in this print serves up a visual pun, as the seeds (zi) in the open pomegranate are homophonic with the character for “son.” The fruit therefore symbolizes the wish for male offspring to ensure the family line over generations. The print’s palette of pastel pink and green resonate with that of contemporary porcelain.The Ding Family Workshop is known for using seven or more color woodblocks to produce prints rich in ink tonality and chromatic diversity. The print’s visual interest is further enhanced by the “blindpressed” embossing technique that raises portions of the composition into low relief."
Jug_with_Portuguese_arms,"This ewer with the Portuguese royal arms is witness to the first East-West trade in Chinese porcelain carried on by the Portuguese in the mid-sixteenth century. The form is neither Chinese nor European; rather, it is based on an Islamic metalwork vessel made for the Near Eastern market that was appropriated for the new European trade. The Chinese painters have misunderstood the Portuguese coat of arms, which appears upside down."
Piece,"The wealthy throughout Europe adored Chinese silks, which were exported in massive numbers by the Spanish, the Portuguese and the British. Finely woven, and delicately painted by hand with exquisite floral motifs, designed to resonate with European taste, this type of patterning was described as “sprigged” in trade records. Glossy taffetas like this were used in Europe as dress fabric and as wall hangings."
Plate,"A Chinese plate painted with this exact composition must have served as a model for the painters at the Bow factory in England, for a Bow plate in the Museum’s collection (2014.600) is decorated with precisely the same composition executed in a very similar palette. Surprisingly, one is able to match a piece of British or European porcelain with a Chinese prototype relatively rarely, and it is even more unusual to find an original model that has been copied with such fidelity. This Chinese plate makes an extremely interesting comparison with the Bow example, and both the similarities and slight differences between the two are instructive, as it reflects both the type of Chinese porcelain being imported into England in the second quarter of the eighteenth century and how chinoiserie-decorated porcelains were marketed to English consumers in the middle decades of the eighteenth century."
Punch_bowl,"This punchbowl, which was produced for export to England, is decorated with four scenes of musicians playing their instruments. The larger scenes depict European musicians while the smaller ones on the sides show Chinese musicians in concert. A print by an anonymous British artist served as the source for the painted scene on the bowl's front. Elaborate gilding and small vignettes of Chinese landscapes enhance the punchbowl's ambitious decorative scheme."
Length_of_painted_silk,"The wealthy throughout Europe adored Chinese silks, which were exported in massive numbers by the Spanish, the Portuguese and the British. Finely woven, and delicately painted by hand with exquisite floral motifs, designed to resonate with European taste, this type of patterning was described as “sprigged” in trade records. Glossy taffetas like this were used in Europe as dress fabric and as wall hangings."
"Dish_with_IHS_monogram,_armillary_sphere,_and_Portuguese_royal_arms","While the doglike lions illustrate a Chinese theme, the Portuguese coat of arms and the armillary sphere (a type of celestial globe) are often found on works made for Portugal in the early sixteenth century. The letters ""I.H.S.,"" a well-known Latin reference to Jesus Christ, would later be adopted by the Jesuits (Society of Jesus founded in 1534) as a symbol for their order."
Bulb_pot,"This unusual vase combines the wide, stable base of a traditional bough pot (made for holding larger flowering branches) and the long, slender neck of a single flower holder. The bowl of the pot holds the soil and provides a warm, moist environment for the bulbs to germinate; the thin neck and five openings in the scalloped base of the pot force the emerging bulb stalks upward and outward, creating a unique and beautiful flower display. Bulb pots rarely have the neck element featured on this piece; more commonly, they have a flat top with several openings for the bulb stalks."
Dagger-Ax_(Ge),"This dagger-ax is cast with series of slits to be tied to a shaft, and it is distinctive for the curved profile of its short beak. On one side it bears an inscription naming the Yan Kingdom, one of the last states to fall to the Qin Empire during the Warring States period."
Dish,"The decoration, in a light underglaze blue, features the impaled arms of Edward Harrison (1674–1732) and his wife, Frances Bray. The rendering of the arms by means of a few pseudo-engraved lines and written abbreviations is believed to be unique to this service."
Monteith,"This vessel, which was intended for chilling wine glasses, does not bear a British coat of arms, but its form derives from an English silver example, suggesting it was intended for an English client."
Dish_(part_of_a_service),"The arms on this dish are those of James, fifth duke of Hamilton (1702/3–1743), and it is possible that this dish is part of a large service created for him at the time of his marriage to his third wife in 1737."
Sword_Guard,"Depicting the face of a wrathful Tibetan Buddhist guardian deity, this extremely rare sword guard was originally part of a complete and very lavish sword. It is from the peak period of Tibetan or Sino-Tibetan ironwork, coinciding with the rule of the Phagmodrupa kings in central Tibet and the Hongwu and Yongle dynasties in China. It is exceptional for the precision and crispness of its chiseling, punched work, and damascening; for the height of the raised decoration; and for the balance and cohesion of its overall design."
Teapot,"The gift of the Hans Syz Collection in 1995 endowed the Museum with nearly three hundred examples of European and Asian ceramics meticulously acquired by Swiss-born collector Dr. Syz (1894–1991) to chart the migration of models and patterns from East to West. Documenting a continuous process of influence and adaptation, these pieces provide a discriminating review of the nuances of stylistic change resulting from three centuries of trade."
Plate,"This plate is distinguished by the lavishness of its enamel painting, and by the fact that a design for the plate's decoration survives, the only recorded instance for an armorial service."
Beaker_and_saucer,"Cups of various forms decorated with a solid brown glaze on the exterior and cobalt-blue designs on the interior were a common type of export porcelain. The tall beaker form was for coffee or possibly hot chocolate. This type of export porcelain was known as Batavian ware, after the trading station at Batavia used by the Dutch East India Company, the most important trading firm in the late seventeenth century."
Tureen_with_cover_(part_of_a_service),"This is one of the more striking porcelains to emerge from the American trade with China. The four quadrants of the so-called Fitzhugh pattern of leaves and flowers, rendered in brilliant green enamels, serve to contrast with and accentuate the large spread eagle clutching an olive branch and a bundle of arrows in its talons. Such porcelains often feature the shield of the United States in the center of the eagle's body, yet here the shield encloses a monogram or initials—in this case an M—that would have been painted on site in Canton per instructions given by the purchaser."
"Chinese_zodiac_figure,_snake","By the late Jin and Yuan dynasties, the twelve animals of the zodiac were scarcely included in burials. They were often depicted with exaggerated physical features; their heads are disproportionately large and their expressions are playful and mischievous, like cartoon figures. The snake, for example, smirks and rolls its bulging eyes as it raises its head above its coiled body."
Calligraphy_Couplet,"The poetic couplet on this pair of tapestries is woven to represent calligraphy written in clerical script. The background imitates spotted bamboo, which was highly regarded in China because the spots on the stalks were understood to represent the tears of two empresses after the death of the legendary ruler Shun. The signature indicates that the original calligraphy is the work of Aisin Gioro Songfu (act. early 19th century), a member of the imperial family who was Minister of the Justice from 1825 to 1826. The couplet conflates two different poems by the famous Song dynasty poet Su Shi (1037–1101):Clear spirit and cool mind keep one fromthe mundaneGood harvest and social harmony create ease."
Dish,"A defining feature of kraak porcelain (so-called from the Dutch name for caracca, the Portuguese merchant ship) is the device of paneled decoration, seen here in the wide border of the dish, with its alternation of sunflowers and emblems. The central scene of ducks on a pond and the paneled motifs are among the numerous variants on the basic format of this extensive class of export porcelain. Examples similar to the Museum's dish, which is well made and painted with strong color and with care, if not with spirit, were found in the cargo of the Dutch ship Witte Leeuw, sunk in battle off Saint Helena in 1613."
Woman_with_a_pipe,"A Chinese woman in furs pauses from smoking her pipe to gaze at the viewer in this seductive reverse-painted mirror decorated in Canton for the European market. In the eighteenth century, France and England began shipping silvered mercury glass to Canton, where specialized workshops decorated them to suit the taste of European consumers. Among the most popular subjects were beautiful women. This example probably represents a courtesan, who beckons the viewer into a space of fantasy and material desires."
Dish,"The gift of the Hans Syz Collection in 1995 endowed the Museum with nearly three hundred examples of European and Asian ceramics meticulously acquired by Swiss-born collector Dr. Syz (1894–1991) to chart the migration of models and patterns from East to West. Documenting a continuous process of influence and adaptation, these pieces provide a discriminating review of the nuances of stylistic change resulting from three centuries of trade."
Cymbal_Case_with_Set_of_Cymbals,"In Tibetan processions and dance, drums and cymbals set up basic rhythmic patterns for wind instruments, and in temple settings are used with bells to accompany chant."
Lorgnette_Fan_with_Scene_of_Figures_in_a_Courtyard_Garden,"Lorgnette, or opera-glass fans, were in fashion in France during the seventeenth and again during the latter half of the eighteenth centuries."
Plate,"Chinese export porcelain was one of the luxuries deemed essential to a well-appointed eighteenth-century house. Until 1784, when direct trade began between China and America, Chinese porcelain came to the colonies by way of Europe. This soup plate was part of a large service that descended in the Verplanck family of New York."

Dish,"The Dutch East India Company, which dominated the export of Chinese porcelains to Europe in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, commissioned the Dutch artist Cornelis Pronk (1691–1759) to supply designs that could be copied on porcelain intended for export. This design of a lady with a parasol was one of Pronk’s most popular compositions, and was employed by Japanese porcelain painters as well."
Fire-offering_ladle,"This ladle and its companion (1993.477.1.2) were used to make offerings of fuel during a Homa ceremony honoring Agni, the god of fire, here invoked in the service of Vajrayana Buddhism."

Punch_Bowl,"This bowl depicts the hongs of Canton, where European and Chinese merchants conducted business."
Dinner_Plate,"Eight Chinese immortals standing on stylized clouds ornament the border of this plate, which surrounds a Chinese landscape featuring a variety of foliage, landforms, and architectural structures.

Toddy_Jug,"The initials ET in gold under the spout of this jug are those of Edward Tilghman (1750–1815), a prominent lawyer in Philadelphia. This Chinese export jug was given to Tilghman by his uncle, Benjamin Chew Wilcocks, who originally ordered four jugs similarly decorated with portrait busts of George Washington in grisaille. The portrait of Washington was faithfully copied by a Chinese artist from an engraving by David Edwin after Gilbert Stuart."
Trackers_along_the_Jialing_River,"The Jialing River, which flows across the middle of Sichuan Province, in southwest China, is known for its steep descents and rapid torrents. The trackers pulling ships upstream at this site were featured in several woodcuts that glorified the working class and sympathized with their hardship in the 1940s. Duan Ganqing, a native of Shanxi Province, was a major force behind China’s modern woodcut movement. This work represents his characteristic simple but powerful designs and vigorous lines to fully capture the struggle between man and nature."
Vase_from_sample_set_of_Chinese_cloisonné,"The technique of cloisonné is used to create designs on metal vessels by placing colored glass paste within enclosures made of copper or bronze wires, which have been bent or hammered into the desired patterns. Known as cloisons, French for partitions, the enclosures are generally either glued or soldered onto the metal body. Enamel paste, ground from colored glass, is filled into the contained areas of the design. The vessel is usually fired several times at a relatively low temperature, about 800 degrees Celsius. Once this process is completed, the surface of the vessel is polished until the edges of the cloisons are visible, and then to finish the work, gilding is added."

Coverlet_or_Wall_Hanging,"Asian RococoWealthy British consumers appreciated the skill and decorative effect of Chinese embroidery, which fueled a vigorous import industry. In this example, in a gesture to their clientele’s taste, Chinese needleworkers have rendered a repeat pattern of European rococo motifs–floral, musical and bucolic–in careful detail and lively color. Spread across a generous expanse of fine, soft Asian silk, the bed coverlet or wall hanging must have been quite lovely when viewed in shimmering candlelight."
Plate,"This Chinese porcelain plate is one of a large group of porcelains owned by George Washington (1732–1799) and Henry Lee (1756–1818). Its underglaze-blue Fitzhugh border—an elaborate pattern of the late eighteenth century incorporating flowers, pomegranates, often butterflies, and other Chinese motifs. The plate is also decorated with the emblem of the Society of the Cincinnati (with a blue and white striped ribbon) held aloft by a somewhat whimsical Angel of Fame. An example of an original Society of the Cincinnati medal, created for officers who had served in the Continental Army during the American Revolution, is also in the Museum's collection (35.46a, b)."

Platter,"This monumental punchbowl, with its original cover and platter, must have been one of the most ambitious porcelains to grace an American colonial household. We can only speculate as to how the bowl, the decoration of which indicates that it was made for the Swedish market, found its way to a prominent Charleston family during the eighteenth century. It was listed among the effects of Mary Brandford Bull, upon her death in 1772, as ""1 large China Bowl Dish & Cover."" The Bulls, one of Charleston's wealthiest families, lived in the grand style. Through the four daughters, the bowl descended in the family and ended up in Philadelphia by 1790. The detailed painted scene on the platter is based on a 1691 engraving of the Swedish Chateau of L?ck?, on Lake V?nern. Two other Swedish chateaus drawn from earlier print sources are represented on the bowl; the cover features two Swedish churches in a landscape with huntsmen, fishermen, and sailors."
Punch_Bowl,"This extraordinary punchbowl features a remarkably faithful replica of the engraved certificate, dated December 1785, issued to Ebenezer Stevens (1751-1823) by the Society of the Cincinnati. Stevens was a major-general in command of the New York artillery and was vice president of the New York branch of the society. The decorative silver-gilt mount on the rim and around the foot were probably made during the early nineteenth century in response to an earlier crack—evidence of the extent to which the bowl was valued by its owner. A related bowl, a polychrome version, was made for Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831). Varick was president of the New York branch of the society while Stevens was vice president. Although Varick's military career was tarnished by his association with Benedict Arnold, he later became Washington's confidential secretary and was mayor of New York from 1789 to 1801. It has descended in Stevens’ family. To the left of the inscription is Cincinnatus, with a giant eagle at his side, holding aloft a flag adorned with the American eagle. Lightning bolts repel the English lion and the figure of Britannia. To the right, against a harbor scene, the horn-blowing Angel of Fame displays the seal of the Society."
Underplate,"In 1786 the Salem, Massachusetts, merchant Elias Hasket Derby financed the voyage of the Grand Turk, one of the first to follow that of the Empress of China. He ordered a 272-piece dinner service for himself, possibly including this tureen, which bears his crest."

Teabowl_with_Chinoiserie_decoration,"This cup decorated with an iron-red band of rinceaux and strapwork populated with Chinese figures is the match to the saucer (50.211.250) already in The Met’s collection. The cup’s decoration is characteristic of the inventive Chinoiserie decorations by Ignaz Preissler, who gained fame alongside his father Daniel as an independent decorator of porcelain and glass. The Preissler workshop painted on a variety of surfaces, including examples of Jingdezhen porcelain that featured earlier forms of Chinese decoration, as seen in the underglaze blue rim on this tea bowl. Based in the Kolowrat estates in Hapbsurg-controlled Bohemia, the Preissler workshop brought great ingenuity and imagination to Chinoiserie designs that moved beyond strict copies of Asian examples. Unlike independent decorators from the free city of Nurenburg who signed their works, Daniel and Ignaz Preissler never included their names. Described as Kolowrat serfs, their commissions were closely dictated by Baron Kolowrat, who also provided them with blank porcelains and glass to decorate."
Pagoda_and_Case,"This intricately carved ivory pagoda was acquired in China by Samuel Shaw, who arrived in the port city of Canton (Guangzhou) in 1784 aboard The Empress of China, the first merchant ship sent there from the newly independent United States. Shaw’s tower is modelled after the famous ""Porcelain Pagoda"" of Nanjing, a structure that was synonymous with China for Westerners. The model replicates its distinctive nine-story elevation with tiered roof eaves adorned with small bells."
Beaker_with_“Postele?n_Verkooping”_(porcelain_selling),"The Bohemian workshop of Daniel and Ignaz Preissler was active on the Kolowrat estates in Kronstadt (present-day Kunstàt, Czech Republic) and specialized in transforming unembellished glass and porcelain objects with their extraordinary decorations. These typically drew on print sources and their imagination. This beaker made of Chinese Jingdezhen porcelain depicts a pair of porcelain merchants selling their wares in Batavia, the headquarters of the Dutch Vereeinigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC, the trading company that brought Asian porcelain objects to European households. Decorated using Schwarzlot, a technique that used black enamel with fine details scratched with a needle, the beaker is based on a Dutch print by Pieter Schenk. The Preissler workshop has added elements from different print sources, however, as well as their own decorative motifs such as the palm tree, to create an imaginary landscape that shaped the decorative language of Chinoiserie."
Liberty,"During the Federal period, America’s growing strength and sense of self inspired countless images celebrating the new nation’s ideal of liberty, of which this painting, Liberty in the Form of the Goddess of Youth Giving Support to the Bald Eagle, is one example. Reverse painted on glass for the American market, the image is based upon a 1796 engraving of the same title by Edward Savage of Philadelphia. One of several surviving examples of this popular image, the painting depicts the Goddess of Liberty standing, supposedly, on Beacon Hill, with Boston Harbor in the distance, a reference to the recent evacuation of the British fleet from the harbor. As Liberty proffers a cup to the descending eagle, she tramples below her feet both the key to the Bastille, symbolizing the death of the monarchy in France, and the Star of the Order of the Garter of Britain, symbolizing America’s freedom from England."

Summer_Mountains,"Between the years 900 and 1100, Chinese paint-ers created visions of landscape that depicted the sublimity of creation. Viewers are meant to identify with the human figures in these paintings. In Summer Mountains, travelers make their way toward a temple retreat. The central mountain sits in commanding majesty, like an emperor among his subjects, the culmination of nature’s hierarchy. The advanced use of texture strokes and ink wash suggests that Summer Mountains is by a master working about 1050, a date corroborated by collec-tors’ seals belonging to the Song emperor Huizong (r. 1101–25), whose paintings catalogue re-cords three works entitled Summer Scenery by the otherwise unknown artist Qu Ding."

Chessmen_(32),"The set was made for the English trade. It is interesting that in embodying the conventional English symbols on disks, it is conforming with the Chinese custom of using ivory or wooden disks identified by ideograms."
Chessmen_(30),"The meaning of this set is not clear. The red king, Edward VII, and a very Chinese-looking Queen Alexandra, who nevertheless wears European dress, are accompanied by an Episcopal figure whose vestments have not been understood. The knights have very Chinese-looking horses with a hair tuft beneath the mouth (these pieces may be substitutes from another set). The men suggest English dragoons in the uniform of the period 1825 to 1860. The rooks are tall fenestrated edifices like lighthouses, surmounted by a flag. East and West are strangely combined in the pawns, which are distinctive of no particular country. The nature of the white side is equally hard to determine. No opponent of Edward VII would seem to be embodied in the king, though he carries a European scepter. The queen seems Oriental, and the bishop is of a different character from his opponent and might conceivably be meant to be a Russian or Greek bishop rather than a Roman one. The tower also incorporates Greek elements, Doric comumns, for example, a reflection of European neoclassiciam. Again the pawns are curious hybrids of Oriental and Occidental parentage."
Chessmen_(32),"These chessmen with baluster stems and finials denoting the rank of the piece are based on European models; the work, however, is unmistakably Oriental. The kings and queens are indicated by crowns, and the bishops by miters; the knights are horse heads, and the rooks have the form of crenelated towers with large flags at the top. The pawns are slim and elegant. The baluster stands all feature a carved, pierced, and undercut knop, which in the rook forms the mass of the tower. The bases are typical of many Chinese sets."
Saber_with_Scabbard_and_Belt_Hook_(清____腰刀),"This saber is particularly noteworthy for the beauty and complexity of its pattern-welded blade. As horseback archers, the Manchus had a unique way of wearing their sabers, with the hilt inclined toward the back rather than the front. This made room for a bow and bow case, which were worn on the left hip over the saber, along with a quiver of arrows on the right hip."
Helmet,"This helmet is distinctive both for the quality of its workmanship and for the lively character of its engraved and gilt decoration. Because of its overall form and the style of its ornament, it appears to be an early example of helmet types that are usually associated either with the later part of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) or the more familiar ceremonial helmets of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).The gilding of the fittings consists of two layers: silver foil burnished onto a crosshatched ground, over which a layer of gold was applied, probably by mercury gilding. This unusual two-stage technique gives the gilding its deep golden yellow luster. It also serves to highlight the crisply engraved ornament, which embellishes the helmet's finial, brim, and brow plate. In the center of the brow is the figure of Buddha Shakyamuni seated on a lotus throne. The Buddha is flanked by the fourlokapala, the heavenly guardians of the four directions. Lively dragons, one on each side of a flaming pearl, appear on the finial and brim, a standard motif on virtually all later Chinese ceremonial helmets. Here, however, the design is rendered with a freshness and originality that are unknown on later, more stereotypical examples. Therefore, the innovative nature of the decoration, combined with the skillful construction of the helmet, suggest that this is a very early example of its type. Like some other rare examples of Chinese art, its survival is apparently due to its preservation in Tibet, where it may have been sent from China during the Ming or Qing dynasties as a gift to a high-ranking secular or religious official."
Chessmen_(32),"The European king and queen, possibly Carlos I of Portugal and Queen Marie Amélie, are represented by crowned heads, the bishop by an episcopal head wearing an orientalized miter. Their opponents are Chinese, the king with an elegantly fretted headdress. Both knights are horse heads of a type common in European chess sets of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. An echo of Chinese chess, which has pieces named cannons, is in the mortars surmounted by flags for the rooks. The pawns are heads of Europeans or Chinese on baluster stands. The type of chessmen composed of balusters surmounted by human heads appears also in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the nineteenth century (Wichmann, Chess, pl. 156). Pieces of this type are practical for play. The theme is obviously Europeans and Chinese; the combination of Occidental and Oriental features has been satisfactorily accomplished."
Chessmen_(30)_and_board_and_box,"The red and blue color of the characters is usual in Chinese ivory sets. In the cheaper wooden ones they are yellow and brownish black. The pieces represent: general, counselors, elephants, assistants, horses, chariots, cannons and catapults, and foot soldiers. They are placed on the intersections of the lines, and between the two sides of the board is a space called (Yellow) River. Thus there are ninety places, instead of sixty-four as in the Western game.The substitution of simple disks with the names upon them can be considered the final change from figural chessmen, such as once were used in China, to conventional pieces.The two characters near the hinges on the inside of the board signify together ""River area"" or ""river territory."" The characters on the exterior signify ""article of leisure time"" or ""of recreation"" (leftward of the two vertical legends) and ""not to be lent"" (horizontal legend). other vertical legend consists of proper names, not readable, possibly a club, shop or other resort where object might have been available for communal use."
Pair_of_Stirrups_(清____鉄鑊金馬鐙一副),"In addition to the sculptural chiseling of the dragon heads on each stirrup, the upright posts are damascened in gold with a hexagonal design representing stylized armor, a pattern that is seen frequently on luxury objects in China and Tibet. The treads of the stirrups are pierced with the design of a symbolic jewel, representing prosperity."
Helmet_with_Feather_Crest_(清___羽飾頭盔),"The quality of the pierced and gilt ironwork of the helmet, the four-claw dragons embroidered on its cheek and neck guards, and the exotic materials of the crest indicate that these items were intended for a military officer of very high rank."
Spearhead_(明-清___矛頭),"Despite its heavy surface patina, this spearhead is very similar to another example in The Met's collection (acc. no. 2000.206a, b) for the form of its blade and the presence of a realistic braided ring rendered in chiseled steel (here at the midpoint, rather than the base of the socket). At its base there is a collar of stylized lotus petals and a ring of the trefoil-likeruyimotif. The surface above this is damascened in gold with simplified designs of flaming pearls and mountains and waves."
Gunpowder_Flask_(清__火藥壺),"Most Qing gunpowder flasks are fairly plain and utilitarian containers made of wood, metal, or horn. This example is very unusual for its skillfully carved dragon heads and beautifully figured burl wood, which was often used in China to make fine furniture."
Matchlock_Gun_(清__鳥銃),"Matchlock guns, of both European and Turkish origin, were probably introduced into China in the early sixteenth century through sea and overland trade. Otherwise typical in its form, this gun is unusual for the lavish silver decoration running the length of its barrel, suggesting it was the personal weapon of a nobleman, either for hunting or military use."
Ceremonial_Armors_for_Man_(Dingjia)_and_Horse,"The man’s armor, known asdingjia(armor with nails), is a very elaborate example of the military costume worn at the imperial court by high-ranking officials in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It consists of a jacket with sleeves and an ankle-length skirt constructed of narrow overlapping plates riveted inside the fabric layers with the securing rivet heads visible on the outside. Some of these plates, of brightly polished steel, are exposed on the arms and skirt. Although not intended for use in battle, the jacket is reinforced further with large shoulderpieces, panels under the arms, and a small panel of similar construction that covers the lower abdomen. This fashion thus combines the warrior’s practical but usually plain armor and the ceremonial robes often worn over it.This example is embroidered with gold and colored silk thread, in traditional designs of dragons and waves. The delicately engraved and gilt steel plates at the shoulders repeat these motifs. The helmet is surmounted by a crest of sable tails, coral, and kingfisher feathers mounted with cloisonné enamels. The horse armor has no internal plates but only the rivet heads to give the outward appearance of armor."
Armor,This armor was undoubtedly for a high-ranking military official. It is very similar to a set donated by the Qianlong emperor to a Tibetan monastery in 1757.
Cover,"The gift of the Hans Syz Collection in 1995 endowed the Museum with nearly three hundred examples of European and Asian ceramics meticulously acquired by Swiss-born collector Dr. Syz (1894–1991) to chart the migration of models and patterns from East to West. Documenting a continuous process of influence and adaptation, these pieces provide a discriminating review of the nuances of stylistic change resulting from three centuries of trade."
Ceremonial_Armor,"This armor, undoubtedly for a high-ranking military official, is exhibited with an associated helmet decorated with applied gold ornaments. These include the Buddhist mantra Om mani padme hum in Lantsa characters, which were often used for sacred inscriptions and texts in Tibet, China, and other Buddhist countries.The armor and helmet are very similar to a set donated by the Qinglong emperor to a Tibetan monastery in 1757."
Clock_watch,"This watch looks European, but the inscription, “Made in Qianlong era,” referring to the emperor’s reign (1736–95), reveals it was made in China. Watches such as this illustrate the great enthusiasm in China for European horology."

The horse armor has no internal plates but only the rivet heads to give the outward appearance of armor."
Finches_and_bamboo,"Huizong was the eighth emperor of the Song dynasty and the most artistically accomplished of his imperial line. Finches and Bamboo exemplifies the realistic style of flower-and--bird painting practiced at Huizong’s academy. Whether making a study from nature or illustrating a line of poetry, however, the emperor valued capturing the spirit of a subject over literal representation. Here the minutely observed finches are imbued with the vitality of their living counterparts. Drops of lacquer added to the birds’eyes impart a final lifelike touch."
Yuping_Xiao,"The Yuping xiao, an end-blown flute from Guizhou province (south-west China), provides a softer, more refined tone than more robust sounding versions used in ensembles. These qualities, associated with scholar’s instruments, make it suitable for solo playing or for duets with the qin (fretless long zither). Some xiao like this one have poems inscribed on them."
Bangu_(板鼓),"The interior of the bangu has six wood wedges held together by a brass belt and tightly stretched cowhide. When struck, this small drum produces a sharp, dry sound to signal the different tempi of the piece. Several sounds may be produced depending on where it is struck.Used in Chinese opear by the percussionist who plays many different instruments and is the ensemble’s leader, responsible for setting the rhythm, linking scenes, emphasizing the action and punctuating the singing and speech. This is accomplished by a rich variety of gongs, drums, cymbals and wood blocks. The following examples are a few of the essentials"
Zheng,"The metal strings of the zheng, unlike silk ones on the qin and se, are tuned with pegs located on the top board. Smaller than other East Asian zithers and higher pitched, it has been used for home entertainment, in folk music, in court ensembles, and has been associated with romantic subjects. In the 19th century it was plucked with the fingernails of the right hand while the left hand manipulated the strings to the left of the bridge. Today there are several playing styles. In one, from southern Chaozhou, picks are placed on the fingers of the right hand, the fleshy part of the fingertip being reserved to produce special effects. The modern instrument is larger and has pegs concealed under a cap at its head."
Nanbanzi_(南梆子),This wooden block hangs from the man tougu or the bangu and in a opera ensemble is played by the leader.
ManTou_Gu_(馒头_鼓),"Supported on a bamboo stand and similar in use and construction to the bangu, the smaller man tougu is used more in the South. It has a convex shape in contrast to the flat surface of the bangu."
Streams_and_Mountains_without_End,"Streams and Mountains without End is the grandest surviving handscroll painting from the brush of Wang Yuanqi, one of the most celebrated painters of the Qing dynasty. Subtly varied ink tones describe a vast and constantly evolving riverscape, which unfurls across a handscroll more than seventy feet long. The painting shows many hallmarks of Wang’s typical approach to brushwork and composition—for instance, his layering of brushstrokes and confident interweaving of void and solid. A bold, experimental quality is also evident. Brash contour lines and dotting, along with some particularly daring compositional strategies, make this scroll unusual within the artist’s oeuvre.As the scroll unfurls, Wang cycles through his interpretation of different old master styles, weaving them seamlessly into a cohesive whole. Wang Yuanqi did not sign this work, but he did apply a seal at the very end bearing the character for “servitor” (chen 臣), meaning that he made it for the emperor. This painting, which was documented in the eighteenth century but has been unknown to scholars and painters since, was recently promised to The Met by the family of Lo Chia-Lun, making its debut in this exhibition."
The_Battle_at_Tam-dy_and_Tru-huu,"The Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–96) was so pleased with the copperplate prints produced in Paris to commemorate his East Turkestan campaign (1755–59) that he ordered further sets of prints recording later campaigns to be made in Beijing. This print, with an engraved poem by the emperor, commemorates the Annam Campaign. It was made by a Chinese engraver after a painting, and was printed from the copperplate displayed next to it.In 1788 the Qianlong Emperor sent troops to Annam (Vietnam) at the request of its ruler, who had fled a rebellion there. After initial success, including the battle depicted here, the Qing forces were defeated and withdrew. Nguyen Hue, a rebel leader, became the new ruler of Vietnam and was officially recognized by the Qianlong Emperor."
Chinese_Palampore,"This Chinese embroidered palampore represents the closing of the trade circle of the central tree design, which originated in China, was adapted in England in the mid-seventeenth century, then introduced by English East India Company merchants to textile painters in India. This silk version was made in the late eighteenth century in China, where Cantonese craftspeople embroidered it in imitation of an Indian painted cotton palampore. When it was donated to the Museum in 1947, it was placed in the American Wing, indicating the donor believed it had a history of American ownership. It could have traveled to the newly formed United States on an American ship after 1784, when direct trade with China was established.cat. no. 120"
Bo_(bell)_and_stand,"The bo is a barrel-shaped bell from China that produces a single tone when struck. It has a suspension loop on the top and is hung on a stand. A detail found on many Chinese bells are nine mei, or nipples, grouped in three rows of three. The mei likely had symbolic meaning; the number nine is auspicious in Chinese cosmology and frequently signified the emperor."
Cup,"Glasswares were a rare luxury in ancient China, inspiring similar works in jade. The jade stem cup is modeled after a glass goblet from the Mediterranean, where the shape of the ceramic cup likewise has its roots. The latter cup’s vibrant glazes, called Chinese blue and Chinese purple, are two of only three synthetic pigments invented in the ancient world (the third being Egyptian blue)."
Plate,"Chinese export porcelain was one of the luxuries deemed essential to a well-appointed eighteenth-century house. Until 1784, when direct trade began between China and America, Chinese porcelain came to the colonies by way of Europe. The overglaze floral decoration on this service, made for Samuel and Judith (née Commelin) Verplanck of New York, is entirely European. Were it not for its unbroken family history, the close relationship of the design to that on Meissen porcelain would suggest that it had been made for the German or Scandinavian market. The service was presumably ordered for the Verplancks’ house at 3 Wall Street, where they lived from 1763 until 1803."
Bo_(bell)_and_stand,"The bo is a barrel-shaped bell from China that produces a single tone when struck. It has a suspension loop on the top and is hung on a stand. A detail found on many Chinese bells are nine mei, or nipples, grouped in three rows of three. The mei likely had symbolic meaning; the number nine is auspicious in Chinese cosmology and frequently signified the emperor."
Zhong_(bell)_and_stand,"Zhong is a generic name for Chinese clapperless bells which appear elliptical in cross-section and feature a concave mouth of opening at the lower end. This beautiful and unique form helps to generate two distinct pitches when the bell is struck. A detail found on many Chinese bells are nine mei, or nipples, grouped in three rows of three. The mei likely had symbolic meaning; the number nine is auspicious in Chinese cosmology and frequently signified the emperor. The mei also appear to play an important part in the acoustics of the bells. Experiments suggest that they clarify the tone by shaping the vibratory patterns of the bell’s surface, helping to stabilize and define the bell’s two distinct fundamental pitches.A bat, representing good luck, links the bell with the frame. Bells similar to this were used in sets for rituals or may have been played individually on special occasions."

Night-Shining_White,"A leading horse painter of the Tang dynasty, Han Gan was known for capturing not only the likeness of a horse but also its spirit. This painting, the most famous work attributed to the artist, is a portrait of a charger of Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–56). With its burning eye, flaring nostrils, and dancing hoofs, the fiery-tempered horse epitomizes Chinese myths about Central Asian ""celestial steeds"" that ""sweated blood"" and were actually dragons in disguise. The seals and inscriptions added to the painting and its borders by later owners and appreciators are a distinctive feature of Chinese collecting and connoisseurship. The addition of more than one thousand years of seals and comments offers a vivid testimony of the work's transmission and its impact on later generations.The acquisition of this image, arguably the greatest equine portrait in Chinese painting, marked the Director's early commitment to revitalizing the Department of Asian Art under the curatorial leadership of Wen Fong and with the dedicated support of trustee Douglas Dillon."
Shawl,"The detail of the embroidery in the central genre scene of this shawl is highly unusual. Both the faces and the headdresses of the characters are extraordinarily detailed. The feather headdress is of a type found in Chinese opera, where an extended pair of pheasant feathers are used to indicate the character is a warrior figure--the height of the feathers signify the warrior's rank. The pink crepe lining and two-tiered fringe are two additional details that make this shawl distinctive."

Kenneth Moore, 2001)"
Banyan,"From the sixteenth century, British gentlemen wore loose, informal gowns in the privacy of the home as a comfortable alternative to the stiff and physically restrictive modes of dress required for public settings. Trade through the European East India companies led to new styles of gowns, which were often made of imported materials and variously called nightgowns, morning gowns, India gowns, or banyans. This banyan, composed of a Chinese export silk and quilted for warmth, represents a more fitted style that developed in the mideighteenth century. Fitted banyans reflected a hybrid of Persian, Turkish, and Indian influences but followed the silhouette of contemporary European coats, making them well suited to wearing informally in town or when receiving guests at home. An essential garment for fashionable men, this elegant but functional form of “undress” suggested an urbane, worldly masculinity."
Shawl,"The embroidery on this Chinese shawl is unique in its imagery and level of animation, especially in the realistic depiction of birds and their actions (eating insects, for example). Other atypical details include fruit (pineapples and grapes) and fanciful insects and plant pods. Most of the embroidery is executed in a standard satin stitch but the tails of the grey birds are done in a fine herringbone stitch that imitates the texture of feathers. The fretwork along the border is an unusual touch for shawls made for the Western market."

(J. Kenneth Moore, 2001)"
Shawl,"This foldover shawl is a tour de force of Chinese embroidery. The orientation of the needlework indicates that it was to be worn folded into a triangle; each side incorporates a different color palette. The monochromatic side uses variations in hue to define details. The polychrome side employs beautiful gradations in color, particularly in the configuration of the bird motif. It also features gilt thread, making it unique among other examples in the collection."
Xiao_(簫_),"There are two types of Chinese end-blown flutes: those like this xiao, associated with central China, with a small U-shaped hole cut into the closed nodal end of the bamboo tube; and those from southeastern China and Taiwan called dongxiao, also seen in this case, with a completely open blowing end. Legend holds that this particular type of end-blown, notched flute was created by disassembling a panpipe called a paixiao and placing equidistant finger holes on each pipe. Used in Confucian ceremonies, including weddings and funerals, and often associated with scholars, xiao are sometimes inscribed with poems."
Zhong,"Zhong is a generic name for Chinese clapperless bells which appear elliptical in cross-section and feature a concave mouth of opening at the lower end. This beautiful and unique form helps to generate two distinct pitches when the bell is struck. Naiton, or nipples, dragons and bats appearing on the bell's surface are symbolic of fertility and good fortune. Peaches, symbol of long life, decorate the suspension loop (nui) and a bat, representing good luck, links the bell with the frame. Bells similar to this were used in sets for rituals, or may have been played individually on special occasions."
Sheng_(_笙_),"Southeast Asian in origin and used before the twelfth century B.C., the sheng also played an important role in Confucian music. Now, it accompanies folk songs and is occasionally used in the Beijing opera to add harmony. Similar to the Western harmonica, which it inspired, the sheng is the only Chinese wind instrument capable of sounding many notes at the same time. It is played by blowing and sucking. The bamboo pipes, symbolizing the folded wings of the phoenix, are fitted with free reeds made of metal, concealed by the bowl-shaped wind chamber."
Yueqin_(月琴),"The resemblance of this round lute to the full moon (yue) gave it its name. The yueqin developed from a much larger long-necked lute that appeared in the Qin and Han dynasties. Its four strings are tuned in pairs, a fifth apart. Like the sanxian, it encloses a vibrating plate. Found in popular ensembles and the Beijing opera and used to accompany song, the yueqin has not been fully embraced by the modern Chinese orchestra. The player presses the strings between the high frets making chord playing difficult but giving increased control over the timbre and intonation. Strings are plucked with fingernails or a pick using up- and down-strokes and tremolo techniques that sustain and give color to a tone."

Bǎn_(板_),The ban is related to the paiban and serves a similar purpose: marking time.
Xun,"Simple globular clay whistles, or ocarinas, were among the earliest wind instruments that required an understanding of how pitch is determined by the relationship between the dimensions of the wind chamber and the placement of the finger holes. Ancient versions have finger holes on one side of the ovoid body; later versions, still used in Sino-derived Korean ritual music, have holes located at the cardinal points around the onion-shaped instrument."
Luo_(锣_or_鑼_),"The luo (a generic term for gong) is found in a variety of sizes and, unlike the cymbal (bo), is tuned and is characterized by a quick rise in pitch after it is struck."
Mu_Yu,"The fish is a Buddhist symbol of watchfulness, reflecting a belief that the fish never sleeps. This state of wakeful awareness is reinforced by the hollow sound of the muyu, a fish-shaped slit drum used to accompany Buddhist chant. Laid flat and struck on the red circle with a mallet in measured beats, this version, from Yunnan Province, is a less abstract rendering than most temple instruments. The muyu may also be found in vocal and instrumental ensembles of Guangzhou"
Figure_of_lion_mounted_as_lamp,"This Buddhist lion mounted as a lamp forms a pair with another in the Lehman Collection (1975.1.1729). The lions sit on high plinths, which have a removable drawer. The animals — 1975.1.1728 is the female with her cub, and 1975.1.1729 is the male with his traditional brocaded ball — are decorated in green, yellow, and white glazes. They are fairly well modeled and display a certain amount of animation. The condition is good, except for repairs to the ears in both pieces."

Xiao_(簫),"Used in Confucian ceremonies including weddings and funerals, this end blown notched flute of southeast China and Taiwan, was created by disassembling a panpipe called paixiao and placing equidistant fingerholes on each pipe. Often associated with scholars, some xiao have poems inscribed on them. The Japanese shakuhachi is said to be a descendant of the xiao, which is known as dosho in Japan."
Dish,"The gift of the Hans Syz Collection in 1995 endowed the Museum with nearly three hundred examples of European and Asian ceramics meticulously acquired by Swiss-born collector Dr. Syz (1894–1991) to chart the migration of models and patterns from East to West. Documenting a continuous process of influence and adaptation, these pieces provide a discriminating review of the nuances of stylistic change resulting from three centuries of trade."

Necklace,"This collection of largely ethnographic jewelry includes examples from cultures in South America, North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa and dates from the Pre-Columbian period to the twentieth century. Owned by renowned art collector and fashion enthusiast Muriel Kallis Newman, the collection represents her knowledge and appreciation of a wide range of jewelry design and making traditions. Numerous items in her collection are composite artifacts made from various cultures and time periods reappropriated as modern jewelry creations by or for Muriel. It is important to note that Newman wore many of the pieces in the collection, interpreting them to suit and express her own singular, often avant-garde style."
Bo_(鈸_),"Bo is the generic name for pairs of cymbals that come in a variety of sizes, all with rims that curl upward at the edges. Bo are used together with gongs and drums for military music and play a prominent role in opera productions, where they accent the actors' movements. Several playing techniques may be employed: the discs may be clashed together or held horizontally, with one raking across the other to produce a sustained rolling sound."
Ko-Tze,"Whistles like this one, made of bamboo and gourd, weigh only a few ounces. They are attached to the tails of pigeons, and are heard as the birds fly overhead. When attached to a carrier pigeon, the whistle alerted the recipient of the bird's arrival. Each of these ko tzes is inscribed with the character for ""loyality,"" perhaps in reference to the faithful homing of each pigeon."
Dizi_(笛子_),"In addition to the blow hole and finger holes, the dizi, also known as the di or ti, has an extra hole covered with a membrane or a tissue-thin piece of bamboo which produces a poignant buzzing tone. There may also be a number of vent holes at the end, from which tassels are frequently hung. Usually made of bamboo and closed at the upper end, this example is made from marble."

Chasuble,"This chasuble- the garment worn, tabard-style, by a Catholic priest during church services- is a modest example of modern production."
Suona_(嗩吶_),"Double-reed instruments first appeared during the late Han dynasty, having originated in the Middle East. The term suona derives from zūrna, the Arabic name for the instrument. It is depicted, along with many other instruments, in images created from the third to the fifth century in the Buddhist cave temples at Kizil. The penetrating sound of the suona, ideal for processions and military functions, was easily appropriated for popular music. Several varieties are found in China, including a smaller version called a haidi. The player, whose mouth completely covers the small reeds, uses circular breathing (inhaling through the nose) to maintain a constant tone."

Lapa_(喇叭_),"Like many other instruments, the straight trumpet was introduced into China from Central and West Asia during the Eastern Han dynasty (A.D. 25-220). Originally used with drums and loud wind instruments in state processions and military events, this type of trumpet served a number of purposes during the nineteenth century. It was played in pairs by soldiers, blown by firefighters when they had finished putting out a fire, and sounded at funerals and at the end of some theatrical performances. Itinerant knife grinders and peddlers used a smaller version. The laba exists in a variety of sizes, and like many Asian trumpets, it has a wide, shallow mouthpiece and is collapsible."
Haidi_(海笛_),"This double reed instrument was introduced to China around the beginning of the 16th century and takes its name from the Middle Eastern zurna. Several varieties are found in China, including a smaller version called a haidi. The player, whose mouth completely covers the small reeds, uses circular breathing (through the nose) to maintain a constant tone. It was first used by the military, but today it is played in ensemble or as a solo instrument."
Guqin_(古琴_),"Endowed with cosmological and metaphysical significance and empowered to communicate the deepest feelings, this zither, beloved of sages and of Confucius, is the most prestigious instrument in China. Han Dynasty (206 B.C. - 220 A.D.) writers state that the qin helped to cultivate character, understand morality, supplicate gods and demons, enhance life, and enrich learning. Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) literati who claimed the right to play the qin suggested that it be played outdoors in a mountain setting, a garden or a small pavilion or near an old pine tree (symbol of longevity) while burning incense perfumed the air. A serene moonlit night was considered an appropriate time for performance. Each part of the instrument is identified by an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic name and cosmology is ever present: for example, the upper board of wutong wood symbolizes heaven, the bottom board of zi wood symbolizes earth. Qins over a hundred years old are considered best, the age determined by the pattern of cracks (duanwen) in the lacquer. The 13 studs (hui) indicate finger positions. Strings of varying thicknesses are made of twisted silk."

"The_Kangxi_Emperor's_Southern_Inspection_Tour,_Scroll_Three:_Ji'nan_to_Mount_Tai","In 1689 the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662 – 1722), a Manchu whose forebears had conquered China in 1644, made a grand tour to consolidate his authority over southern China. The renowned landscapist Wang Hui was commissioned to record the journey in a series of twelve oversize handscrolls. This scroll, the third in the set, highlights the emperor’s visit to Mount Tai, China’s “Sacred Peak of the East.” Although Wang based his design on maps and woodblock prints — he never visited the mountain — he also connected specific sites with imaginary landscape passages inspired by classical precedents and employed a traditional “blue-and-green” palette to underscore the emperor’s beneficent rule."

"Brush_holder_with_gardenia,_butterfly,_and_dragonfly",Xu Subai is one of the artists responsible for the renaissance of bamboo carving in China in the twentieth century. The inscription on this brush holder states that the imagery was inspired by a painting by Jiang Handing (1903–1963).
Woods_and_Valleys_of_Mount_Yu,"In 1366, Ni Zan abandoned his home to escape marauding soldiers. Even after the establishment of the Ming dynasty in 1368, Ni continued the life of a wanderer, visiting old haunts that he had not seen for twenty or thirty years. According to his epitaph writer, Zhou Nanlao (1308–1383), ""in his late years, he became quieter and more withdrawn than ever. Having lost or given away everything he ever owned, he did his best to forget his worries. Wearing a yellow [Daoist] cap and country clothes, he roamed the lakes and mountains, leading a recluse's life.""Woods and Valleys of Mount Yu, executed two years before Ni Zan's death, expresses the painter's contentment in the life of a recluse. The poem ends with the lines:We watch the clouds and daub with our brushesWe drink wine and write poems.The joyous feelings of this dayWill linger long after we have parted.The dry but tender brushwork is aloof and restrained. There is a tranquil luminous quality about the painting that makes it one of the most fully realized works of the artist's later years."
Wang_Xizhi_watching_geese,"After the fall of Hangzhou, the Southern Song capital, in 1276, the artist Qian Xuan chose to live as an yimin, a “leftover subject” of the dynasty. Painted in his deliberately primitive “blue-and-green” style, this handscroll illustrates the story of Wang Xizhi ( 303 – 361), the calligraphy master of legendary fame and a practitioner of Daoist alchemy, who was said to derive inspiration from natural forms such as the graceful neck movements of geese. In creating a dreamlike evocation of antiquity, the artist prevented a realistic reading of his picture space as a way of asserting the disjuncture he felt after the fall of the Song royal house."
Biographies_of_Lian_Po_and_Lin_Xiangru,"Poet, calligrapher, and Chan (Zen) Buddhist adept, Huang Tingjian believed that calligraphy should be spontaneous and self-expressive—“a picture of the mind.” Containing nearly twelve hundred characters, this handscroll is a master-piece of cursive-script writing. It transcribes an account of a rivalry between two officials: Lian Po, a distinguished general; and Lin Xiangru, a skilled strategist. Huang’s transcription ends abruptly with Lin’s words: “When two tigers fight, one must perish. I behave as I do because I put our country’s fate before private feuds.” Read in the context of Song political infighting, Huang’s transcription becomes a powerful indictment of the partisanship that led to his own banishment in 1094."

Landscapes_with_poems,"Remaining loyal to the vanquished Ming dynasty, the hermit Gong Xian came to terms with himself as an yimin, or “leftover subject,” under the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). In this leaf, from an album in which he compared his favorite haunts in and around the former Ming capital of Nanjing with the abodes of the immortals, Gong complemented his image of a reclusive dwelling with a poem that contrasts the ability of orchids, symbols of virtuous men, to endure the cold winter, while brambles — lowly men — are used as firewood. The artist perfected a technique of ink wash and dotting that enabled him to achieve both density and translucency in his paintings."
Brush_holder_with_flowers_and_poems,"This brush holder epitomizes the kind of molded gourd vessels made in the imperial workshop during the Qing dynasty. These ingeniously crafted containers were made by encasing a young gourd in a wooden mold composed of several sectional wood panels with engraved motifs. As the gourd grew, it filled the mold and took its shape, including the surface decoration."
Table_screen_with_landscape,"This table screen is among a very rare group of cloisonné enamel paintings of landscapes produced by the imperial Ming workshop. The blues and greens of the landscape evoke a golden age of Chinese painting. The meticulous and elegant treatment of copper wires to represent traditional brushwork demonstrates the successful application of Chinese taste and design to cloisonné, a technique imported from the West one century earlier."
Archaistic_tripod_censer_(ding),"Linked to power and dominion over the land, the ding is one of the most important ritual vessel types. They were used to cook and serve food offerings. Similar to other ritual bronze vessels, ding were originally made as ceramics, then were cast in bronze in the Shang dynasty. In the later periods, ding were produced in ceramics and metalwork not only as ritual vessels but also to serve as incense burners. The seventeenth-century parcel-gilt bronze ding follows archaic models, but its heavily gilded surface and fine patterned ground set it apart from replicas."
Stem_cup,"Occupying a portion of the ancient Silk Road that bridged China and Central Asia, the Western Regions (Chinese: Xiyu) played an active role in intercontinental trade and cultural exchange from the seventh to the ninth century. The twelve zodiac animals on this gold cup indicate the influence of Chinese culture, while the intertwined vines encircling hybrid animals reflect Sogdian and Persian metalworking practices of ancient Iran."
"Old_Trees,_Level_Distance","Guo Xi, the preeminent landscape painter of the late eleventh century, sought to give form to poetic images and emotions and was particularly interested in conveying the nuances of seasons and times of day. Old Trees, Level Distance,a variation on the classic “level-distance” formula of tall foreground trees set against a wide river valley, is probably a late work done for a fellow government official on the eve of his retirement. In the final section of the handscroll, the leafless trees and deepening mist impart a forlorn, autumnal air to a scene in which two elderly figures approach a pavilion, perhaps to join colleagues in bidding farewell to a friend."
Emperor_Xuanzong's_Flight_to_Shu,"In 745, after thirty-three years of able rule, the Tang emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–56) fell in love with the concubine Yang Guifei and became indifferent to his duties. When Yang’s favorite general, An Lushan, rebelled in 755, she was blamed. Forced to flee from the capital at Xi’an to the safety of Shu (Sichuan Province), the emperor was confronted by mutinous troops demanding the execution of his lover. Reluctantly assenting, Xuanzong looked on in horror and shame and abdicated soon after. This painting depicts the somber imperial entourage after the execution. While the accoutrements of the figures are Tang, the painting's landscape style of intricately described volumetric forms and mist-suffused atmosphere suggests a mid-twelfth century date."
"In_the_Street,_from_the_series_City_Diary","Difficult to discern at first glance, this densely textured print depicts migrant workers from rural areas searching for jobs in the city. Here, they moonlight as street musicians playing homemade instruments. Drawn from observations of daily life, He Weimin’s series City Diary includes works produced from 1987 to 2007.He Weimin developed his woodcut style from seal carving, creating contrasting geometric forms in black and white. He was trained and has been active in both China and the United Kingdom."
Chessmen_(32),"The rooks are elephants with circular towers on their backs surmounted by flags; a mahout sits on the elephant's head. The elephants are carved in a curiously wooden manner, far less skillfully than the horses with which the Chinese were familiar. The bases are deeply undercut to form an open design of flowers and leaves. Chinese ivory sets are often carved with great skill and furnished with ornamental bases, some, like these, being foliated. In others carved balls are incorporated in the baluster support or movable concentric balls. These sets were made as gifts for foreigners, or for sale to them, and well-known foreign personages were incorporated into many of them. Others, such as this, consist entirely of Chinese figures, usually with some of the characteristics of the Manchu dynasty, which reigned throughout the nineteenth century and on to 1912. It has been suggested that some of these sets represent Chinese versus Mongols, but the iconographical details here do not bear out the suggestion-it is a fanciful opposition."
Famous_Women,"In 1799, the scholar Cao Zhenxiu wrote a cycle of sixteen poems about famous women of history and legend. Not content with the usual heroines—chaste widows and filial daughters—Cao selected women of more diverse talents, foregrounding poets, calligraphers, and warriors and arguing for an expanded notion of female virtue. She then commissioned the young virtuoso painter Gai Qi to illustrate her poems. Although some of the scenes take place indoors, several of them feature garden settings, including the ones you see here. Light in ink tone, Gai’s images display a seemingly endless variety of brushwork, from dry, rounded strokes to evoke the rough texture of rocks to pinpoint black lines to describe sharp grasses."
"Brisé_fan,_with_representations_of_classical_figures_flanking_Venus_and_Cupid","This brisé fan- composed purely of ivory sticks- is a very fine example of Chinese carving. Particularly sought-after in Europe, beautifully worked ivory mounts were sent from China with blank medallions, which could be customized with painted vignettes once they arrived in Europe. This example has been painted, to a very high quality, with a central figure group of Venus and Cupid- amended from a design first developed by Swiss painter Angelica Kauffman (1741-1807)- flanked by flower-bearing nymphs. The painted paper ribbon which further embellishes the fan is original."
"Plate_with_scene_from_""Les_Oies_de_Frère_Philippe""","This plate depicts a tale from a famous collection of stories by a seventeenth-century French author, Jean de La Fontaine. The story concerns a young man encountering women for the first time, as seen here, and it served as the subject of a painting by Nicolas Lancret, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (see 2004.86). The plate faithfully reproduces Lancret’s composition, and it reflects the adoption of European images by Chinese potters in order to appeal to foreign markets."
Treasure_Series_1:_Chinese_Goddess,"Created in the post-Mao period, this woodblock print exemplifies Chinese artists’ re-engagement with China’s historical art. Framing a sensual classical torso in the doorway of a Buddhist cave temple injects these traditional art forms with a modernist sensibility."
Chinese_Landscape_Tattoo_No._4,"In his 1999 photographic series Chinese Landscape Tattoo, Huang covers his torso and arms with traditional landscape scenes, presenting his “reincarnation” of literati-style painting. The composition, modeled in ink and colors on a white ground by Huang’s wife, the artist Zhang Tiemei (b. 1968), follows the natural form of Huang’s body. In the photos, the artist’s face is cropped away and Huang’s anonymous torso becomes an emblem of the Chinese everyman who cannot be separated from his cultural heritage, which, like his racial identity, is as indelible as a tattoo."
Chinese_Landscape_Tattoo_No._2,"In his 1999 photographic series Chinese Landscape Tattoo, Huang covers his torso and arms with traditional landscape scenes, presenting his “reincarnation” of literati-style painting. The composition, modeled in ink and colors on a white ground by Huang’s wife, the artist Zhang Tiemei (b. 1968), follows the natural form of Huang’s body. In the photos, the artist’s face is cropped away and Huang’s anonymous torso becomes an emblem of the Chinese everyman who cannot be separated from his cultural heritage, which, like his racial identity, is as indelible as a tattoo."
Pair_of_Stirrups,"These stirrups are interesting as late examples in the continuum of traditional stirrups from the Tibetan plateau. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has a strong collection of distinctive stirrups from the fourteenth or fifteenth century through the eighteenth century and two pairs of stirrups made in the 1930s and 1940s for known patrons (2005.427.2a, b and 2008.81b, c). This pair appears to date from the mid to late nineteenth century or even early twentieth century, and bridges the gap between other examples in the Museum's collection, not only chronologically, but also in terms of form and style. They are unusual for the very streamlined, almost art deco, treatment of the dragonheads; for the prominent inclusion ofqilin(so-called Chinese unicorns) in the decoration, a motif seldom found in a Tibetan context; for the style of the damascened decoration, reminiscent of late Tibetan and Chinese metalwork; and for the use of gold leaf, which is unusual, possibly unique, in the decoration of stirrups from this region. The weight, mass, and form also indicate their relatively late date and the changes that occurred in the design and construction of stirrup styles used on the Tibetan plateau in this period."
Teapot,"The scene, which is repeated on the opposite side, depicts the apotheosis of Gustav III (1746–1792) as heir to the Swedish throne; it is copied with care and fidelity—and a modest addition of flesh tones—from an engraving by Abraham Delfos (1731–1820) after a drawing by Hieronymous can der My (1687–1761)."
Right_Half_of_a_Cantle_Plate_from_a_Saddle,"This plate comes from the right half of the cantle, or back rim, of what must have been an extremely luxurious ceremonial saddle, either made in Tibet or in China for the Tibetan market. Its iron ground is intricately pierced, chiseled, and damascened overall in gold and silver. The fineness and complexity of the workmanship, particularly on the scrollwork interspersed with dragons, are particularly noteworthy."
Plate,"This plate is part of a group of four decorated with compositions representing Water, Earth, Fire and Air after designs by Francesco Albani."
Woman_at_her_dressing_table,"A woman sits before a large bronze mirror at a dressing table. Her attendant, who stands behind her, places a sprig of blossoming China rose into her coiffure. Glancing sidelong into the mirror, the seated woman beholds her reflection.The setting is a finely appointed studio with a scholarly air, filled with books and scrolls of painting and calligraphy. A large banana plant, visible through a circular window, indicates that the room is adjacent to a garden. The luxurious accoutrements that fill the interior space indicate the woman’s education and refinement. Among the books that fill the shelf behind her, a single title is visible: Retrospective of poems by Famous Women (Mingyuan shigui 名媛詩歸), an anthology of poems written by female authors throughout Chinese history. On the table, an inkstone and a water pot indicate that the woman herself is a writer.Other accoutrements suggest that the woman may be a courtesan. These include the boxes on the table—made for storing cosmetics and adornments like hairpins and earrings that she wears—and the flute hanging on the wall behind her, a nod to the association between musical entertainment and the pleasure quarters. In premodern China, the loftiest courtesans were women of status and power whose ability to engage in poetry and other scholarly arts was part of their appeal for their companions. The artist who painted this work captured well the combination of scholarly elegance and sensuous luxuriousness that would have made the courtesan’s quarters a place of unique allure. The curtains that open to reveal the scene to the viewer heighten the sense of a stolen glimpse into a privileged space.The artist has paid obsessive attention to the objects that fill the space, creating a riot of layered textures. The tiers of patterned silks that adorn both women, the nesting lacquer boxes, the lovingly described mottled pattern of the stone inlaid into the table top, the gnarled rootwood stand that supports the mirror—all of these add to the sumptuousness of the artwork and were clearly core elements of the painter’s craft.The painter Leng Mei, to whom this artwork is attributed, trained at the court of the Kangxi Emperor, where European painting techniques were fashionable and were sometimes incorporated into Chinese paintings. This hybrid visual mode is evident in the current painting in the teapot to the proper right of the seated woman’s head, which reveals an awareness of how to create the illusion of spatial recession and how shading in the European fashion can impart a sense of volume. Shading has also been applied to the legs of the table to indicate a single light source, a technique that was not used in China prior to its adaptation from European painting in the seventeenth century."
Barbara_de_Braganza,"The chain around the man's neck (see pendant bust 1975.433.1) may represent the Order of the Golden Fleece, awarded only to Catholic dignitaries. It is unclear whether the pair, designed for export, was intended as actual portraits (perhaps representing the Spanish viceroy and his wife, who ruled the Philippines from Mexico City), but the carver no doubt based his work on an engraved or painted European model."
Landscapes_after_old_masters,"This album contains paintings by Wang Hui and four of his students. In 1692, Wang was organizing a major imperial commission to commemorate the Kangxi emperor’s 1689 Southern inspection tour, a visit to the empire’s south. As the workshop master, Wang had to find worthy assistants, and this collaborative piece seems to have played a role in the selection, as the four students who worked on this album would go on to assist with the Southern Inspection Tour handscrolls. Each leaf is painted in the manner of a different old master; together, the album expresses Wang Hui’s and his students’ mastery of the landscape painting tradition."
Set_of_Saddle_Plates,"This set of saddle plates represents a high point in the medium of pierced ironwork, equaling or excelling anything of its type. Each plate is chiseled from a single piece of iron. The long, thin four-clawed dragons, carved in high relief in great detail, are cut entirely free from the surrounding scrollwork ground so that they can move slightly within it. The scroll patterns are undercut to give the appearance of depth and overlap, in addition to the areas where the bodies of the dragons actually do overlap. There is a Wish-Granting Jewel motif made with pieces of blue and green turquoise set in shaped compartments in the center of both the pommel and the cantle, and scattered lotus blossoms made in the same way. The outer edges of the plates are bordered by rows of semicircular pieces of lapis. The iron surfaces of the plates are damascened completely with gold foil, and the precision and fineness of the cross-hatching beneath the gold are exceptional."
Fernando_VI_of_Spain,"The chain around the man's neck may represent the Order of the Golden Fleece, awarded only to Catholic dignitaries. It is unclear whether the pair (see pendant bust 1975.433.2), designed for export, was intended as actual portraits (perhaps representing the Spanish viceroy and his wife, who ruled the Philippines from Mexico City), but the carver no doubt based his work on an engraved or painted European model."
Old_Testament_figures,"The clothing and other attributes of these figures suggest that they are Old Testament personages, which are rarely depicted in Chinese art. The inscriptions alluding to the Ten Commandments on the tablets held by one of the figures (second to the right) imply that he is Moses; the crown and harp of another may identify him as David; and the remaining two are most likely prophets. Flat crossbars with holes on the bases of the figures indicate that they may once have been part of a larger ensemble that was secured onto a platform"
Side_Table,"This elegantly simple table would have been used to hold books, small objects, or the Chinese zither (qin). Itsrectilinear design and butterfly-corner legs with stretchers are derived from early box construction."
Miscellaneous_Studies,"This album plays on the theme of reality versus illusion. The moon is reflected in a basin of water, a flower is next to its image in a mirror, and a butterfly is attracted to chrysanthemums painted on a silk fan. Chen emphasized the multiple levels of his artifice on this album leaf by incorporating his signature within the composition of the fan painting and by screening one wing of the butterfly with the fan, forcing us to view the insect through the painting as well as through the medium of painting. Other artful manipulations are represented by a miniature potted garden, or penzai (bonsai, in Japanese), which shows how man can transform nature, and by a twig with worm-eaten leaves, which underscores how nature constantly transforms itself.There is no precedent for these symbolic still-life subjects in scholar painting. Instead, these highly sophisticated images, which relate to the ornamental designs found on deluxe crafts of the time, including molded ink cakes, printed stationery, and the carved decoration of Yixing ceramics, reflect Chen Hongshou's early involvement in creating woodblock illustrations for novels and dramas."
Vase_in_the_shape_of_an_archaic_bronze_vessel_(gu),"Both the shape and decoration of this vase derive from archaic ritual bronzes of the Shang dynasty (ca. 1600–1046 B.C.). Unlike porcelain pieces produced at Jingdezhen, works made in the Yixing kilns were often signed, in this case by Chen Jinhou, making this ceramic tradition one of the first examples of studio pottery in the global history of ceramics."
The_Immortal_Magu_with_a_deer,"Su Xuejin was one of the most talented porcelain artists in Dehua during the turn of the twentieth century. His sculptures often feature meticulous details and are full of life energy. Here, the supernatural being Magu, holding the magic fungus of longevity, is attended by a deer carrying a basket of auspicious fruits and flowers on its back. Such sculptures were popular birthday gifts among privileged members of society."
Buddhist_monk_Bodhidharma_(Chinese:_Damo),"The bald head, meditative posture, and monastic clothing identify this figure as Bodhidharma, the Indian monk credited with founding the Chan (or Zen) tradition of East Asian Buddhism."
Boy_with_water_buffalo,"Auspicious symbols and visual puns expressing good wishes are recurring themes in Chinese decorative art. A delightful example is this white nephrite sculpture that depicts a small boy gently prodding his companion, a large water buffalo, with a stalk of rice. The ears of rice symbolize a good harvest and rhyme with the Chinese word for “year” (sui), thus implying the wish for “a good harvest year after year” (sui sui nian feng)."
Excerpt_from_“Song_of_Leyou_Park”,"Zhang Jizhi, the last important calligrapher of the Song period, was a devout Buddhist who often transcribed religious texts as an act of devotion. He obtained his jinshi degree, the highest rank in the civil service examination, but never rose to high office. As a calligrapher, however, his fame spread beyond the borders of the Song to the Jin empire in northern China as well as to Japan, where his handwriting was particularly prized by Zen monks. Zhang was noted for his forceful large-character standard script, with its boldly contrasting blunt and sinuous brushstrokes. This piece, remounted centuries ago in Japan for display in a tokonoma, was cut from a long handscroll transcribing a poem by Du Fu (712–770) in such a manner that the poetic phrasing of the original is completely fragmented. The original two couplets may be translated as follows (the text of this scroll is on the fourth and fifth lines):Heavenly gates open in clear skies,ripples vastly trembling;By the Serpentine, kingfisher curtainshang arrayed with silver plaques.Brushing the water, hovering,dancing sleeves flutter;Climbing to the clouds, crisp and clear,the sounds of songs arise.(Translated by Jonathan Chaves)"
New_Window_Decoration,"This print of a peasant who practiced modern hygiene promotes an educational campaign organized in rural areas by the Communists. The artist incorporated the style and motifs of traditional popular prints, such as paper cuts for window decoration, in his celebration of the new hero. The couplet next to the left and right margins reads:Hygiene model;A life as long as South Mountain.Luo Gongliu was first known as a woodcut artist before he became an oil painter and author of iconic images of the Chinese Communist revolution. In 1938 he went to Yan’an, the Communist power base in northwest China. The experience of making prints and living among rural people in wartime had a profound impact on his art."
Incense_burner_with_floral_pattern,"Taking the form of a typical Chinese incense burner, this vessel features an unusual decoration. The tree peonies and rocks encircling the exterior and the palmettes adorning the handles were likely chased from the vessel’s original plain surface by a European metalsmith. In addition to a spurious Xuande mark in Chinese, its base bears a second mark, “ALPH GIROUX PARIS,” revealing that the vessel once belonged to Alphonse Giroux (1775/76–1848), a French dealer in luxury goods."
The_Sixteen_Luohans,"In the Chinese popular imagination, mendicant monks, conjurers, and mysterious hermits were often thought to be disguised “living luohans,” or Buddhist holy men capable of producing miracles. When government corruption and ineptitude imperiled social order, as it did in late Ming times, such superstitious messianic beliefs became more widespread. Here, in one of his earliest extant works, Wu Bin embraced an archaic figure style and followed the tradition of depicting luohans as fantastic eccentrics whose grotesque features belie their inner spiritual nature. Wu’s humorous painting may have had a serious message: holiness can be concealed within an outwardly incongruous form."
Portrait_of_Qu_Yuan,"The poet-statesman Qu Yuan (ca. 340 B.C.–ca. 278 B.C.) is a towering figure in Chinese culture for his literary talent and moral rectitude. His rhapsodic composition Songs of the South is a beloved classic, while his tragic suicide by drowning serves as an extreme gesture of protest and uncompromising loyalty.Yang Newei began making woodblock prints about 1937, without having received formal training, and he played an active role in promoting woodcuts in his native Guangxi Province. A member of the All-China Woodcut Artist Association for Resistance, he created a number of works depicting the wartime devastations of the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45)."
Old_Man_Boating_on_a_River,"Zha Shibiao was born in Xiuning, Anhui Province, but spent the latter part of his career in the prosperous commercial center of Yangzhou. Like many Anhui artists, Zha favored the Yuan recluse painter Ni Zan (1306-1374) as his artistic model. However, Zha, unlike his fellow townsman Hongren (1610-1664), often chose to disregard Ni's dry and sparse style. This large painting is typical of the wet, uninhibited ""ink play"" of Zha's mature years. The poem Zha transcribed suggests that he had a specific style in mind for this painting. The poem was composed by the noted scholar-artist Mi Fu (1052-1107). Zha's rendition follows the calligraphic style of the original manuscript so closely that he must have seen either it or a close copy. Inspired by the poem's imagery, Zha also adopted the large, horizontal ""Mi texture dots"" for his pictorial interpretation. The poem describes the scenery of the Xiao and Xiang region of Hunan Province:In Shabu everything is harmonious,In Songmen rafts are covered.Carefree, I casually row my boat,As if traveling in a picture of the Shanxi River."
Landscapes,"When Fan Qi created this album in 1646, Nanjing was still smoldering after the destructive Manchu invasion of the city and establishment of Qing rule. During this chaotic period, Fan Qi took refuge at the Buddhist Monastery of Pure Coolness (Qingliang Si), situated on a hill in the northwestern quarter of the city. These intimate paintings depict the local scenery of Nanjing as a series of idyllic retreats and express the artist’s desire to transcend the turmoil by remembering places that exist beyond the world of politics."
Landscapes,"Gong Xian fled Nanjing when the city fell to the Manchus in 1645, and during this chaotic period, several members of his family perished. ""Preserved through reclusion and purified in retirement,"" Gong came to terms with himself as an yimin, ""leftover subject,"" under the new Qing dynasty.The loose treatment of landscape elements in this album, as defined by bold contour lines and repetitive clusters of dots, is indicative of its late date, probably around 1688. The contrast between pale ink washes and dark dots that enabled Gong to achieve both incredible density and translucency in his paintings is echoed by the contrasting dark and pale passages in his poetic inscriptions, which reflect the artist's spontaneous reinking of his brush."
Landscape_in_the_style_of_Huang_Gongwang,"This large hanging scroll shows Mo Shilong struggling to achieve a strong sense of three-dimensional form. Piling up hummock and plateau motifs of the Yuan master Huang Gongwang (1269–1354) into a few interlocking units, Mo built a mountain ridge line that stands solidly within the picture frame.Mo Shilong's career was cut short by his early death, and it was his brilliant friend Dong Qichang (1555–1636) whose paintings and critical writings ultimately defined a new orthodox canon in scholar-amateur painting. This scroll supports Mo's significant contribution to Dong's revolutionary new style. An inscription by the contemporary connoisseur Chen Jiru makes clear how deeply Mo's vision impressed his contemporaries:Mo Shilong's calligraphy and painting brought about a revival of those arts in our district. Even Dong Qichang was one of those who followed him."
Relieve_the_Wounded_Soldiers,"In this print maimed and sick soldiers in disarray present a picture of helpless suffering during the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45). The subtitle at the bottom—“A True Sketch of Yeh-Pei Front”—indicates the artist’s intent to provide a truthful visual record of the ravages of war in northern Guangdong Province. An English translation of the full title provided an appeal for international humanitarian support. Liu Lun, a student at the Guangzhou Municipal School of Fine Arts in the early 1930s and an active member of the Modern Prints Society, zealously participated in anti-Japanese resistance efforts."
The_Toy_Daddy_had_Brought_Back_from_the_Front,"Liu Lun made a series of prints during the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45) that advocated resistance. This one depicts a soldier bringing back a trophy-toy to his family from the victorious Battle of West Hunan. He offers a doll in a Japanese costume to his youngest child who, unaware of its previous owner, reaches for the desirable toy. The boy in front plays with a piece of cloth that bears the image of the sun, similar to the Japanese flag."
Living_Aloft,"Wen Zhengming painted Living Aloft for his friend Liu Lin (1474–1561), who, at the age of seventy, had retired from government service but had not yet built a home suitable for his new life. Wen's painting presents an idealized vision of life in retirement: separated from the outside world by a stream and a rustic wall, two friends enjoy each other's company in a two-story hall that is further isolated in a tall grove of trees. Wen elaborates on the pleasures of such a life in his accompanying poem:Immortals have always delighted in pavilion-living,Windows open on eight sides-eyebrows smiling.Up above towers and halls well up,Down below, clouds and thunder are vaguely sensed.Reclining on a dais, a glimpse of Japan,Leaning on a balustrade, the sight of Manchuria.While worldly affairs shift and change,In their midst a lofty man is at ease.(After Ling-yün Shih Liu, trans., in Richard Edwards et al., The Art of Wen Cheng-ming [1470–1559] [Ann Arbor: Museum of Art, University of Michigan, 1976], p. 150)"
Odes_of_the_State_of_Bin:_The_Seventh_Month,"The album from which these leaves are drawn depicts moments from “The Seventh Month,” a lengthy poem from the Book of Odes about the yearly agricultural cycle. Using the bright blue-green mineral palette associated in Chinese painting with antiquity, the artist created vignettes of labor in tune with the land: the reaping of crops in the summer; the harvesting of ice in the winter; the performance of ritual offerings in the spring. In each of these scenes, small moments of human interaction share the stage with the drama of seasonal change."
The_Last_Bullet,"Its cinematic quality and rich graphic details make this print a highly unusual wartime work. The central figure’s action becomes all the more heroic as we begin to take in his fallen comrades, the burning wreckage, and the horrendous chaos about to engulf him.With no formal training in art, Huangyan (literally, “mist in the wilderness”) began making woodblock prints as a teenager, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937. This work is widely considered his masterpiece."
Anchorage_on_a_rainy_night,"Anchorage on a Rainy Night illustrates how Ming scholar-artists intertwined poetry and painting to create a vehicle for intimate exchanges among a close-knit circle of friends. Radiating a mood of subdued introspection, the painting mirrors Shen's state of mind less than two months after his father's death, when he found solace in a friend's company. Shen drew on the pictorial vocabulary of the Yuan artist Huang Gongwang (1269–1354): softly contoured peaks, flat plateaus, and outcrops of round boulders accented by dark foliage dots and a few foreground trees. But Shen simplified Huang's complex brush idiom to a few brush conventions and a narrow range of ink tonalities, and he reduced Huang's richly articulated compositional structure to a geometric scheme of repeated diagonals in which the wedge-shaped foreground, receding stream, echelon of successively taller trees, and distant mountain slope all point toward the upper right, where he added a poetic inscription that places his visual tone-poem in context:Sparse paulownia leaves bring drops of morning dew,East of the ancient city in the rising sun's slanting rays,Swallows fly low over the overflowing pond.Thus I know that tonight the spring rain will be plentiful,How fitting that fish should leap and ducks swim.On the twentieth day of the last [lunar] month of spring in the dingyou year [May 2, 1477], I lodged on a boat tothe east of the city with Weide. After the rain, everything grew quiet. I did this picture and poem to capture the mood.In response to Shen's poem, his close friend Wu Kuan added a poem following the same rhyme scheme along with the observation that the harbor Shen has described is none other than the one fronting a farmhouse owned by Wu's family."
Landscapes_after_Song_and_Yuan_masters,"Lan Ying was a breaker of boundaries. Dong Qichang and his cohort, the leading tastemakers of Lan’s day, tended to look down on painters who relied on virtuoso skill and flashy brushwork, preferring directness and simplicity. Lan, a prolific and skilled professional artist, nevertheless won them over, transcending his status as a professional and gaining provisional entry into the class of scholar-painters. Lan adopted Dong’s practice of making old-masters albums, and this is one of his finest. Here, Lan marries his eye for dramatic composition to an uncharacteristic restraint in brushwork, avoiding his more typical strong, angular forms that would have raised eyebrows among literati critics."
Old_Man,"This vivid portrait of a pensive old man demonstrates Wang Shuyi’s mastery of Western-style wood engraving. Using Western copperplate instruments on the side grain of the wood, he created finer details and more textural variations than conventional woodcut techniques would have achieved. The old man’s skin, textured through fine cross-hatching, is exemplary of his ingenious experiment.Self-taught in the art of printmaking in the mid-1930s, Wang Shuyi later joined the All-China Woodcut Artist Association for Resistance during the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45), active mostly in his native Guizhou Province. He continued to make woodblock prints through the 1940s."
Barbaric_Bombardment,"This print presents a bird’s-eye view of the Japanese bombing of Guangzhou between August 1937 and October 1938. The horror of modern warfare is summed up by the two bombers dashing toward the viewer above the chaotic city. The close-up of dead children in the lower right corner epitomizes the crime against humanity.A native of Guangdong Province, Zhang Hui entered Shanghai Art College in 1930 and began making woodblock prints in about 1932. His early works reflect the influence of the Belgian printmaker Frans Masereel (1889–1972). In response to the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45), he started the journal Woodcut Battleground to advance resistance efforts."
Landscapes_after_Tang-dynasty_poems,"Sheng Maoye, a professional painter active in his native Suzhou, shows in his work a lively interest in the shifting atmospheric effects of landscapes in mist and rain or of clouds at twilight or dawn. In these album leaves, images suggested by couplets excerpted from Tang-dynasty (618–907) poems provided the springboard for the artist's imagination. Sheng's interest in exploring the descriptive potentials of monochrome ink—sometimes with the addition of pale colors—to suggest different states of atmospheric realism was shared by his contemporaries in the Nanjing area, including Fan Qi (1616–after 1694) and Gong Xian (1619–1689)."
The_Quarrymen_(Hewing_Rocks),"In the early 1940s, Wang Qi created a series of prints depicting people and customs in Sichuan. This one presents an overview of a quarry at high noon from the perspective of two workers taking a break in the shade. The stark contrast of black and white brings out the intensity of scorching sunlight and the brutality of the harsh working conditions.A student of Western painting at the Shanghai Fine Arts College, Wang Qi left east China at the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and later attended the Lu Xun Institute of Literature and Art in Yan’an. He returned to his hometown, Chongqing, in late 1938 and pursued woodcuts as a more expedient wartime art form. This work is exemplary of his style during that period."
Water_dropper_in_the_form_of_a_mythical_creature,"This water dropper has a similar look to the bronze water dropper in Japanese scholar Ichikawa Beian’s collection. Made of porcelain, it is an artful evocation of ancient bronze examples. The work also draws attention to the technical virtuosity of the potter, whose use of a greenish-brown glaze successfully mimics the patina of an ancient bronze. It is not coincidental that both Chinese and Japanese literati shared similar interests in stationery objects that have roots in archaic bronzes."
Poems_from_the_Pavilion_of_Fundamental_Truth_(Zhenyi_Ting),"This album preserves a group of poems written by the great art patron and critic Zhou Lianggong (1612–1672). Zhou was one of the key figures in the art scene of the mid-seventeenth century; he fostered contemporary painters and also wrote about their accomplishments. His critical writings on painting were published in 1673 under the title Duhua lu (A record of [The Pavilion] for viewing paintings), and they have been considered the essential source on seventeenth century painting ever since. This album preserves versions of some of the material that appears in Duhua lu, which makes it a source of signal importance for the study of Zhou Lianggong, the art scene he fostered, and his career as a critic.Zhou was well regarded as a calligrapher. His signature style, evident throughout this album, features a juxtaposition of thin ligatures with blocky, angular lines to create a charmingly eccentric and somewhat raw effect. In this, Zhou was particularly influenced by the calligraphy of the Song dynasty (960–1279) Emperor Lizong (1205–64, r. 1224–64), who pioneered this style in the thirteenth century."
Foliated_dish_with_flowers_and_fruits,"This is a rare example of Chinese painted enamel that bears its maker’s mark. Written in an archaic seal script, the mark on the bottom reads “made by Wan Yannian.” Historical documents tell us little about this artist or his workshop, but based on the style of his other pieces, the metalworker was likely active in the Canton area during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries."
Poem_on_Promulgating_the_Almanac_at_New_Year’s,"On this large piece of brownish paper, Wen Peng, an eminent painter, calligrapher, and seal carver of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), transcribed a poem in running-cursive script in five columns. The poem reads,The time–announcer waits for daybreak by the imperial hall.The elegant palace where multitudes of officials gather exudes fresh grandeur.At the turn of the year, I feel ashamed for passing the time doing nothing.The issuing of calendar, appropriate for spring, happens to take place on a spring day.The twilight of dawn initiates the path of the sun,As if the smoke from incense burners were spreading over the royal court.The promulgation of the almanac has always been a significant event.What an honor that the profound grace reaches even a humble official!Wen Peng龍樓候曉報鷄人，玉殿千官氣象新。改歲自慚虛過日，授時春得又逢春。熹微曙色開黃道，髣髴鑪煙散紫宸。頒朔從來傳盛事，覃恩何幸及微臣。文彭The text is followed by three artist’s seals: “Wen Peng zhi yin” (文彭之印), “Wen shi Shoucheng” (文氏壽承), and “Guozi xiansheng” (國子先生).The poem describes the ritual of issuing the coming year’s almanac presided by the emperor, which took place at court at the beginning of the year during Wen Peng’s time. Wen served as Erudite of the Directorate of Education (Guozijian boshi) in Nanjing, the secondary capital. Although he was nominally affiliated with the same institution in Beijing, there is no record of his taking office in the capital. This poem could be inspired by a similar ceremony held in Nanjing which he witnessed, or an exercise in the conventional genre of court poetry. Composed probably on an occasion associated with the ceremony, the poem reveals how Wen embraced his identity as a court official."
Landscapes_in_the_manner_of_Song_and_Yuan_masters,"Yun Shouping was a member of the close circle of artists that made up the early Qing Orthodox movement. A protege of the ""Four Wangs,"" he gained their admiration for the sensitivity of his brush handling, which was said to have exceeded even that of his contemporary and close friend Wang Hui (1632–1717).This landscape album, one of Yun's earliest dated works, rivals his elegant flower paintings in the exquisite delicacy of its brushwork and variety of its compositions. The individual leaves range from monumental landscape scenes in the manner of Wang Meng (ca. 1308–1385) to intimate studies of isolated trees and rocks in the style of Cao Zhibo (1272–1355). The finely modulated brush lines and spare compositions are deeply expressive of Yun's retiring and highly principled character."
"Bodhisattva,_probably_Avalokiteshvara_(Guanyin)","Large-scale sculptures of bodhisattvas wearing extraordinary jewelry epitomize stylistic and iconographic innovations in Chinese sculpture from the second half of the sixth century. The astonishing jeweled harness adorning this bodhisattva is made up of two long strands of pearl-like clusters and multifaceted beads. Some elements, such as the triangular pendants, have Chinese precedents. Others, such as the pearl cabochons, derive from Central Asian traditions. The appearance of such elaborately figural sculptures, which later became standard in Chinese Buddhist art, attests to a growing devotion to Avalokiteshvara in the second half of the sixth century. It is possible that the jewels refer to a passage in the Lotus Sutra in which the historical Buddha Shakyamuni and another bodhisattva extol Avalokiteshvara’s great compassion and presents him with a pearl necklace as a symbol of his benevolence."
The_Stronghold_of_War,"This print from the politically charged series The Furnace Fire Is Even Redder shows workers, cadres, and technical staff studying the 1960 Angang Constitution (inscribed on the wall) and reading The People’s Daily.During the summer of 1975, when this print was made, Angang was a focus of the political strife between Deng Xiaoping (1904–1997), who avidly advocated modernization, and his “anti-rightist” opponents."
Dwelling_among_mountains_and_clouds,"Some scholars have questioned the authenticity of this monumental painting attributed to Gong Xian, who is better known for smaller works and more precise application of ink. Whether by the artist or a follower, the work eloquently expresses the ideal of the scholar’s rustic retreat in both image and verse. The poem reads:Where I dwell white clouds often crowd;But only deer travel my just-opened mountain path.How wonderful to bring wine up to the pavilion;Letting go a pure song in the shadows of the setting sun.—trans. by Maxwell K. Hearn"
The_Character_of_Characters,"徐冰 汉字的性格 水墨動畫Throughout his career, Xu Bing has grappled with the power of the written word. His iconic installation Book from the Sky (1987–91) surrounds the viewer with thousands of Chinese characters that, upon closer examination, are invented nonsense words. He followed that with Square Word Calligraphy (1994), a system for writing English that looks like brush-written Chinese; for readers of English, Square Word Calligraphy inverts Book from the Sky, providing a breakthrough to meaning where none was apparent at first. In this new work, created specifically for “Out of Character,” Xu continues to engage with the written Chinese word, providing a sprawling and thoughtful meditation on the development of Chinese characters and their systematization as calligraphy. For this video, Xu created over 1,000 individual sketches, which were blended digitally to generate this animation."
Censer_in_the_form_of_a_mythical_beast,"This robust incense burner demonstrates high-end porcelain sculpture and epitomizes the antiquarian interest of the late Ming dynasty (1368-1644) for creatively reviving the form and styles of ancient Chinese bronzes. Based on a Han dynasty (206 BC to AD 220) prototype, this Ming dynasty example was identified as a luduan, an auspicious unicorn able to master foreign languages that would only appear when a virtuous ruler came to the throne. This representation of the creature is not simply a copy of an ancient prototype; rather its playfully animated form and décor mark it as a brilliant antiquarian creation. This design also played as a model for contemporary and later artworks in other mediums, such as bronze and cloisonné."
Dish,"In response to the great demand for Japanese Imari, the Chinese developed a version of their own for export. In this so-called Chinese Imari, famille verte enamel colors (dominated by shades of green) are added to the basic palette of red, blue, and gold."
Tureen_in_the_form_of_a_goose,"This goose tureen is a significant example of Chinese export porcelain made for the European market in the second half of the eighteenth century. Its large scale and sculptural form attest to its ambition. The number of surviving tureens of this model testify to the popularity of the form, and examples with coats of arms indicate that many were made for the Portuguese and Spanish markets. This tureen would have been accompanied by a stand, but as in this case, most surviving Chinese export porcelain animal-form tureens have become separated from their stands. The tureen’s enamel decoration is a fine example of Chinese export from the years around 1770."
Chasuble,"This garment is a tabard-like chasuble, intended to be worn by a Catholic priest during church services. Throughout the nineteenth century, Chinese textile workers catered to Europeans' love of the color and decorative elegance of their work through a vibrant and widespread export market. This example is not quite as fine as some other Chinese-made European vestments in The Met's collection (for example, 62.215.2 or 1973.118a) and likely represents the cheaper and later end of the market. The chasuble has been used and worn until its fine silk fell into holes, with some incongruous patching on the front of European woven floral silks– either French or British."
Chasuble,"Eighteenth-century Europeans were entranced by the light touch and vibrant palettes of Chinese embroidery, worked upon soft, lustrous Chinese silks. This chasuble– the tabard-like garment worn by a Catholic priest in Christian church services– is part of a partially-surviving set of church vestments in The Met's collection (see 1973.118b, .118c, .118d). The complete set was decorated and assembled in China for the export market; although the front and back of the chasuble were each made in a single piece, the chasuble's Chinese designers evoked the European convention of sewing together separate side panels and central ""orphrey"" strips. At some point in its history, the chasuble needed considerable repairs after the wear-and-tear of decades' use worn by priests: patches cut from a matching item in the vestment set were very carefully applied to the garment's front around the chest area, the seams and joins hidden by a broad, nineteenth-century passementerie braid, which has since been removed."
Plate,"The Helena Woolworth McCann collection of Chinese-export porcelain is a lasting tribute to the knowledge and judgment of the collector whose name it bears. The objects in her collection, consisting of about 4,000 pieces, of which 441 were generously given to The Met, were made in China to the order of European and American clients during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. Assembling such a comprehensive and distinguished group not only called for rare insight and informed taste, but required extensive travel and search in Europe. The typical collector of this material focuses on wares destined for one region: the Continent, England, or America. Mrs. McCann, however, collected without regard to the market, the resulting collection thus reflecting the variety and extend of the trade in Chinese porcelain throughout the Western world at the peak of its popularity.Following her untimely death in 1938, her children gave the collection to the Winfield Foundation, created in her memory for educational and charitable purposes. Today, Mrs. McCann's extraordinary collection of Chinese export porcelain is dispersed among twenty-six museums in the United States and one in Canada, and has been made accessible to the public as a source of pleasure and instruction. Pieces of her collection remain highlights of The Met's world-class holdings in Chinese-export porcelain."
Punch_bowl,"The armorial, depicting Saint George trampling the French flag, was devised by the Anti-Gallican Society, an organization formed in London in 1745 to discourage the importation of French goods. This European topical motif is complemented by finely painted Chinese genre scenes enclosed in frames of Meissen derivation."
Chalice_veil,"Though Jesuit priests were received at the Chinese court with great appreciation of their learning and courtesy, a misunderstanding occurred between the Pope and Emperor K’ang-his toward the end of the latter’s life. By the second half of the eighteenth century, Christian services were forbidden in China and vestments such as these were made only for a market outside China."
Maniple,"Though Jesuit priests were received at the Chinese court with great appreciation of their learning and courtesy, a misunderstanding occurred between the Pope and Emperor K’ang-his toward the end of the latter’s life. By the second half of the eighteenth century, Christian services were forbidden in China and vestments such as these were made only for a market outside China."
Wall_panel_with_garden_urns,"The Chinese produced both painted wallpaper and painted silk wall hangings for export during the eighteenth century, and the workshops that made these wall coverings may have used the same patterns for both techniques. Silk wall coverings accounted for a very small percentage of the textiles exported from China to the West.1 Along with the painted papers, however, their influence on the perception of chinoiserie in Europe is probably disproportionate to the actual number produced, as these wall coverings became closely associated with the invention of the ""Chinese room,"" an essential feature of European country houses and retreats.2Painted pictorial wall decorations were entirely new products developed specifically for the European export market. Nothing like them were used in domestic Chinese interior decoration. The antecedent may have been the Chinese practice, noted by early travelers, of using monochrome paper coverings on their interior walls to create the effect of a uniformly white wall, without other decoration.3 Painted silk may have been used as a substitute for paper in the eighteenth century, as suppliers had a difficult time manufacturing enough paper to meet the requirements of European clients. In 1759 one such customer, Emily Lennox (1731–1814), great-granddaughter of Charles II of England and wife of James Fitzgerald, Earl of Kildare (1722?1773), commissioned her husband to buy her 150 yards of painted taffeta for bedroom furnishings while he was in London. Although the acquisition of this amount in a single pattern was said to be impossible, he finally succeeded, and according to Emily the painted ""Indian"" silk was only slightly more expensive than a silk damask available in Dublin, and infinitely more attractive.?Paper hangings depicting garden scenes with flowering trees that grow from large Chinese vessels resting on decorative stands are preserved in several German and English collections.? This painted silk also appears to be influenced by Indian chintz palampores, with their delicate meandering branches bearing a variety of fruits and flowers and populated by assorted small birds and insects. Here the regular meander and the delicacy of the design are closer to the dress silks of the later eighteenth century than to the more regimented garden scenes of the wallpapers. It is a charming hybrid of the Chinese and Indian motifs that continued to be popular into the late eighteenth century.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]Footnotes1. See Jolly, ""Painted Silks from China,"" p. 167.

Stole,"Though Jesuit priests were received at the Chinese court with great appreciation of their learning and courtesy, a misunderstanding occurred between the Pope and Emperor K’ang-his toward the end of the latter’s life. By the second half of the eighteenth century, Christian services were forbidden in China and vestments such as these were made only for a market outside China."
"Brisé_fan,_with_representations_of_pastoral_scenes_flanking_Venus_and_Cupid","This brisé fan- composed purely of individual ivory sticks, without a solid parchment, paper or fabric leaf- is a very fine example of Chinese carving. Particularly sought after in Europe, beautifully worked ivory mounts like these were sent from China with blank medallions, which could be customized with painted vignettes once they arrived in Europe."
"Brisé_Cockade_Fan,_with_Painted_Floral_Posy","This fan represents the epitome of highest quality and design sought by Europeans from China throughout the nineteenth century- and imitated in Europe by less technically precocious pieces such as The Met's British-made fan 65.80.14. The incredibly fine detailing of the fretwork in this Chinese example is unusually well-preserved, suggesting that this large fan was made as a presentation gift, not intended to be used."
Dish_with_John_the_Baptist,"Christian symbols appear on Chinese porcelain as early as the early sixteenth century, but this unusually large plate is one of the first known works with a biblical scene. The composition depicting John the Baptist and Christ in the Jordan River is based on a passage from the Gospel of Saint Matthew, as indicated by the inscription (""MAT. 3, 16""). The plate may have been intended for export to Europe or for use by recently converted Christians in China."
Apostle_plate_with_inscription_of_Saint_Phillip,"This plate, which depicts Saint Philip, originally belonged to a set of dishes illustrating Christ’s apostles as well as John the Baptist. The Chinese potters likely used images from European prayer books as sources for the portraits. Also European in origin is the distinctive border design, although no source has yet been identified."
Plate_with_a_vase_of_flowers,"The vase, halberd (axe-headed weapon), and musical chimes on the plate’s central panel and rim are Chinese symbols carrying auspicious meanings: they form a rebus couplet suggesting ""peace and good luck"" (pingan jiqing) and ""happiness and may all things be as you wish"" (jiqing ruyi)."
Chasuble,"This garment– a tabard-like Chasuble, intended to be worn by a Catholic priest– is an early example of what would become an increasingly lively export market of Chinese embroidered needlework to Europe. The brilliant palette, combining yellow, green, red, orange and deep blue, and delicate patterning of birds within foliage is very representative of the Asian needlework most prized in Europe. Indeed, the decoration of this chasuble closely resembles another within The Met's collection (1973.118a). This piece, however, has been tailored in the conventional European style, with each face of the chasuble constructed out of three panels of textile, whereas 1973.118a– like most surviving Chinese chasubles for the European market– is composed of a single length of embroidered silk, patterned to look as if it consists of multiple pieces."
Plate_with_figures_in_arbor,"It is probable that the composition decorating this plate derives from a drawing by the Dutch artist Cornelis Pronk (1691–1759), who is known to have furnished designs to the Dutch East India Company. Pronk’s drawings were widely employed by Chinese porcelain painters as sources of decoration for porcelain intended for export to Europe."
Teabowl_and_saucer_with_quail_and_peonies,"The age-old Chinese pictorial subject of paired quails and rice stalks (substituted here by peonies) first appears on paintings dating back to the twelfth century, and perhaps earlier. The images functioned symbolically to form a rebus that suggested peace and harmony."
Folding_Cabriolet_Fan_with_Scene_of_Figures_in_a_Courtyard_Garden,"Cabriolet fans like this one are distinguished by their multiple leaves, divided by arcs of exposed sticks. Set one above the other, they suggest the spoked wheels of ""cabriolet"" style horse drawn carriages. This fan is a lovely example of Chinese work, its painted leaves colorfully evoking a scene at the imperial court- a popular type produced specifically for the European export market."
Textile_with_crowned_double_headed_eagles,"Crowned and splayed double-headed eagles, symbols of the Habsburg dynasty, are woven into this Chinese textile, one of a large group of related examples made for the Portuguese and Spanish market in the last part of the sixteenth century. The group represents an early production for export of complex woven silks that integrate both Iberian and Asian aesthetics and design. In this example, the eagle holds in its talons arrows that pierce a heart-shaped vase. The device of a heart pierced by arrows is associated with the Augustinian religious order, while representations of floral vases were popular motifs in China.The conflation of pious and secular imagery seen here may be the result of free rein being given to the master weaver commissioned to produce the cloth. Although the pattern, colors, and general layout have a notable European character, a number of details point to an Asian hand in the design. The form of the oddly shaped leaf on the scrolling vines, for example, resembles Chinese floral patterns more than the European acanthus leaves we might expect to find, especially as associated with the grapelike fruit cluster motif that repeats throughout. Additionally, the stylized dark blue flowers are Chinese peonies; they alternate with the eagles, whose extended, erect neck feathers and patterned breasts recall the graphic means sometimes used by Chinese artisans to render the image of a phoenix. It could be that the weaver modified an original source (perhaps a European print) to incorporate these Asian elements within the overall European format.A related group of silks, possibly from a different workshop, shares some of the design features seen here, including the arrow-holding double-headed eagles amid scrolling vines, although in that group the eagles are contained within narrow vertical panels delineated by leafy borders. Multiple examples of textiles with this design exist; in general, they have the same crimson red (lac dye) ground and are decorated in two colors, blue and yellow. In addition to silk, these fine woven textiles incorporate flat threads of gold leaf on paper, typical of East Asian works.1 A complete cope (Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto) and a portion of a chasuble (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) made of this fabric confirm that it was used in Christian ecclesiastical vestments.2 The exact location of production for this group of silks is unknown, but the combination of Iberian and Asian motifs and styles is typical of products exported through Macau, a major center of trade in the sixteenth century.Although other Macau silks possess similar design elements, the color scheme of this example, with its pattern of green, blue, and yellow, is distinctive. It has been proposed, based on the motif of the arrow piercing the heart, that the fabric was made specifically for Augustinians active in the Philippines, but examples found in Spain, Portugal, and other European centers suggest it may have been part of the larger Iberian trade.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]Footnotes:1.

"Folding_Cabriolet_Fan_with_Multiple_Scenes_of_Performers,_Landscapes,_and_Figures_in_Courtyard_Gardens","Cabriolet fans like this one are distinguished by their multiple leaves, divided by arcs of exposed sticks. Set one above the other, they suggest the spoked wheels of ""cabriolet"" style horse drawn carriages. This fan is a spectacular example of Chinese work made to appeal to the European market: colorful painted scenes, with applied faces of ivory and real silk clothing, contrast with distinctive, wide, tortoiseshell sticks and guards, further decorated with golden lacquerwork: a procession of figures, floral posies, insects, tassels and masks."
Coffeepot,"This model of coffeepot appears to be the earliest produced in China for export to Europe. Its tall, tapering octagonal form was influenced both by Dutch Delftware coffeepots and by English silver coffeepots. This early production of coffeepots for export to the West reflects the speed with which the Chinese export ceramic industry responded to the growing demand for coffee wares in Europe. This form proved hard to fire because of its straight sides and angles, and it soon was replaced by a more easily produced cylindrical model."
Bowl_with_dragon,"On the exterior, a dragon sports with a flaming pearl. Because of its auspicious associations, this traditional Chinese motif frequently appeared on objects intended for use at the imperial court. By the sixteenth century, dragons were freely used as motifs on objects intended for public consumption, provided the dragon had only four claws—the fiveclaw version was reserved for the emperor."
Coverlet,"Embroidered in China with a dragon roundel at its center and four distinctive figures dressed in European garments in the surrounding field, this coverlet reflects the two disparate worlds of East and West and the contradictions that arose from artistic exchange between them. The men wear breeches and doublets, whose style and cut generally conform to late sixteenth- and early seventeenth century European dress.1 Yet these Western garments, depicted with detailed embroidery, bear certain characteristic Chinese motifs: one man has a dragon design on his doublet, while another’s costume shows a typically Asian auspicious motif of intersecting diamonds within a diagonal lattice. In addition, the men’s features—including wispy mustaches and beards—have an Asian character. While the embroiderer may have intended to represent Portuguese gentlemen, there is a certain mixing of imagery and types here that is seen in other decorative arts of the period that depict foreigners, such as the painted Japanese Namban screens showing the ""barbarians"" arriving in Japan.2The basic design of the coverlet, which at some point was lined in a vibrant clamp resist-dyed silk from India (MMA 1975.208a-c), consists of a central roundel in a field surrounded by one or more borders; although this layout is frequently seen in works made for export, it also appears in domestic Chinese kang (daybed) covers.3 Its imagery—including dragons flanking a flaming jewel, the birds and flowers of the border, and the Chinese-style lions in each corner—is common in Chinese textiles. Some of the details, however, are unusual, or are combined in unexpected ways, suggesting the involvement of a European trader or client unfamiliar with the selection and placement of motifs in Chinese iconography. The jewel between the dragons, for example, is uniformly surrounded by flames, resembling a Western sun more than the characteristic Asian flaming jewel. And the lotus pond at one edge of the border, which would normally be the backdrop for pairs of waterfowl, such as ducks or egrets,? instead features large pheasants, more often depicted in a dry, rocky setting.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]Footnotes1.

"Panel_with_flowers,_birds,_and_animals","This large rectangular textile with Chinese motifs and embroidery techniques is part of an important but little understood group of related works made in China for export.1 Described by various scholars as hangings, covers, or coverlets, all the textiles in the group share a common layout with a central roundel in a rectangular field, surrounded by multiple borders. This type of composition is often associated with the influence of Portuguese and Spanish models, although there are some earlier Asian examples that employ this format as well.2Wholly Asian in subject and style, however, are the motifs. The pair of phoenixes at the center of the textile encircle a large peony. Similar dynamically posed birds are also seen in an architectural stone relief excavated from the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) capital and now in the National Museum of China, Beijing, as well as in a corresponding textile in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum,3 and peonies often figure in Ming rank badges, in which a pair of birds encircle a flower. Within the rectangular field are flowers and four more birds -- two golden pheasants and two peacocks, which were used as insignia for the second and third civil ranks in both Ming and Qing China.The multiple borders surrounding the central field include a wide border embroidered with various animals—rare creatures such as a tiger and elephant in addition to the familiar horse, deer, and goat, all of which are depicted side by side with such distinctively mythical Chinese beasts as a blue qilin and a white, singlehorned xiezhi. A composite animal with hooves and usually a single horn, the qilin is mentioned in poetry as early as the Han dynasty (206 b.c.–a.d. 220),? its appearance was sometimes said to signal the birth of a sage, and it was used as a rank insignia for nobles. The xiezhi also appears in Han dynasty texts; known for its ability to distinguish virtue from evil, it used its sharp teeth and single horn to bite and gore wrongdoers, and it was the insignia for the censorate, which included judges. Here, both animals have flames shooting off their bodies, indicating their supernatural powers.Embroideries of this type were made for export, and a number have been preserved in Japan and Europe in historical contexts. The oldest documented example is an altar cloth in Saikyo￣ ji, a temple in Kyoto; it was donated in 1616.? Another example, now in the Museo Diocesano, Chiavari, Italy, was donated to a church in Chiavari in 1651 and used as a baldachin, or canopy, for the clergy.? Others are preserved in museum collections.?Chinese textiles and other goods came to the Americas via the Manila galleons’ annual trips between Acapulco (and Callao, the port city of Lima) and the Philippines. While to date no preserved embroideries from this group have been found in Mexico or Peru, their influence was present there by the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century,? as evident in the similar layout and motifs of a Peruvian tapestry in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (fig. 33).?[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1.

"Textile_with_elephants,_crowned_double_headed_eagles,_and_flowers","A symbol of exoticism and power, the Asian elephant (identified by its small ears) shares the visual space of this finely patterned silk satin damask with a European double-headed crowned eagle beneath a stylized, oval-shaped lotus.1 The elephant is shown with multiple tusks, three on one side and one peeking out on the other. As such, the animal seen here likely represents the Buddhist six-tusked elephant described in a fifth-century Chinese translation of a sutra as being resplendent and white and having lotuses, jade maidens, and other symbolic figures at the end of each tusk.2Elephants have a long history in China. Given as tribute to the emperor by local rulers, particularly from neighboring Southeast Asian regions where they were raised, elephants were also presented as diplomatic gifts to important foreign kings. Apart from their use as work animals and army transport, they were sometimes tamed to provide entertainment in times of leisure, beloved by the royal courts. In sixteenth-century Europe, elephants held a similar fascination for royals and commoners alike, and they appear in the works of such artists as Durer and Raphael. Shipped by boat from Ceylon to Lisbon, elephants were offered as gifts of the Portuguese kings to the courts of Spain, Austria, France, and England. In 1514, Manuel I of Portugal gave a white elephant (the famous ""Hanno"" known through Raphael's drawings) to Pope Leo X. An elephant given by the court of Lisbon to Philip II of Spain in 1581 was subsequently passed along to Henry IV of France. A year later Henry, in turn, gve it to Queen Elizabeth of England, a brillia;nt ""re-gifting"" of an asset deemed too expensive to maintain.3Here the combination of Buddhist symbols and Habsburg eagles produces a composite message of a religious and political nature that juxtaposes the two cultures of Asia and Europe. We do not know how long this long-preserved length of fabric was originally used, but its delicate quality indicates that it may have been part of a garment or hanging.?Woven in China and likely exported through the port of Macau, this textile's blend of Asian and European taste and style was intended for a foreign market that may not have understood the Buddhist elements but nonetheless would have appreciated the fine weaving and exotic designs.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]Footnotes1. The textile is composed of a five-harness satin damask, with a blue warp and yellow weft. The blue color is presumably indigo, while the yellow dye was made from the Asian pagoda tree (Sophora japonica). Dye analysis was conducted by Nobuko Shibayama in the Department of Scientific Research, Metropolitan Museum, with High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Photo Diode Array (HPLC-PDA).2. ""The creature is colossal . . . and is whiter than the snows of the Himalayas. At the ends of his six tusks are six bathing tanks, in each of which grow fourteen lotuses. On each open blossom is a ‘jade maiden’ fairer than the damsels of Paradise, in whose hands are five spontaneously created lutes; each lute is accompanied by 500 other musical instruments, and 500 jewel-colored birds."" Guan Puxian pu sa xing fa jing (Sutra on the Practice of Visualizing the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra), in Soper, ""Literary Evidence for Early Buddhist Art in China,"" p. 223.3. See Bedini, The Pope’s Elephant, Gschwend and Bellet, The Story of Suleyman, and Lach, ""The Elephant,"" pp. 152 ? 58.4. The panel comprises two widths of cloth seamed together: identical patterns that are somewhat mismatched at the join. A fragment of the white selvage with a blue stripe is preserved along the seam in two areas (visible at the back). Digby, ""Some Silks Woven under Portuguese Influence in the Far East,"" pp. 55 ? 56 and n. 11, notes that several Asian damasks from Macau have a white twill selvage with a stripe and that the structure of this selvage is distinct from other silks thought to be from Macau; the elephant silk conforms to the technical features of that group. Since we have little information as to the exact provenance of these textiles, technical features such as these can be important for identifying the potential locale of their production"
Panel,Painted silk and chintz wall hanging were used in many European interiors.
Vase,"The design of the handles is derived from Dutch versions of 16th–18th century ""winged"" glasses."
Laozi_riding_an_ox,"This outstanding bronze depicts the semilegendary Daoist philosopher Laozi. It captures an apocryphal moment in the sage’s life when he departed for the west on a dark ox to become a hermit. The mark on the figure’s back indicates the sculpture’s maker and date. Notably, a similar sculpture was included in a well-known handscroll depicting antiques in the imperial Qing collection of the early eighteenth century.Inscription己巳年造玉融薛鳴陽製Made by Xue Mingyang of Yurong [modern Fuqing, Fujian Province] in the jisi year."

Plate,"The scene on this plate appears to be free copy of an engraving by Joseph Wagner (1606–1780), of Jacopo Amigoni's painting ""Aqua."" In the engraving the scene is placed in a rural setting with architecture, there is no child, and the position of the man is reversed. However, the attitude of the woman and the presence of one or two details, makes the identification with Amigoni reasonable."
Jar_with_the_emblem_of_the_Order_of_Saint_Augustine,"The primary motif on this jar—a double-headed eagle clutching a heart pierced with arrows—served as the emblem of the Catholic Order of Saint Augustine. In the sixteenth century, Augustinian friars established monasteries in Mexico, the Philippines, and Macau (in Southern China); the jar may have been produced for missionaries in one of these locations. While the jar probably served a functional purpose, its white porcelain body and cobalt-blue decoration would have appeared luxurious to friars accustomed to humble vessels."
Panel,"Thin silks painted with flowers, birds, and butterflies for dress lengths, fan leaves, and screen panels were the final phase of China’s ancient silk trade with the West. The soft ecru ground of this unusual example, suggesting some special kind of unbleached silk, enhances the pearly quality of the white lotus and clematis petals."

Box_with_narcissus,"This elegant box features beautifully carved narcissi with blooming flowers and swaying leaves. The complex layering of forms matches the style of Chinese lacquers and jades dating to the early Ming period. An almost identical box, now in the Nezu Museum, Tokyo, however, bears an inscription by the Japanese lacquer artist Yo?zei stating he was imitating the work of the Chinese fourteenth-century master Zhang Cheng. Whether this piece proves to be a Chinese original or an unsigned Japanese copy, the extraordinary carving distinguishes the box as an excellent example of cultural exchange between China and Japan during the fifteenth century."

Bowl_and_dish,"The inventory number is the mark for famille verte porcelains in the Japanese Palace and is evidence that these were acquired by Augustus the Strong, whose collection of Asian porcelain is immensely important as a document of 18th-century trade, taste, and influence. They are listed among twelve ensembles of the same description and inventory number in 1770 (Inventarium 1770, vol. IV, fol. 47a)."
Chasuble,"Of modest design and execution, this is part of a larger set of vestments (38.86.1-.5) likely made and decorated in China for export to Europe. The set is dominated by the sage green palette of the light silk ground material. The floral motifs are embroidered with colorful- but very thin- silk threads, resulting in some losses exposing the rudimentary underdrawings. Originally, the surfaces would have been decorated with spangles and sequins, most of which have been lost."
Plate,"The Oxford botanical garden was founded by Henry Danvers, Early of Danby, in 1632 (1573–1644). It was situated south of Magdalen college on land formerly used as a burial place for the Jews. In 1622, Danvers conveyed five acres of land to Oxford University for the encouragement of the study of physics and botany. In 1631 an agreement was reached between Danvers and Nicholas Stone for its construction. In 1632 the first stone was laid. It is generally agreed that the gateway was constructed by Nicholas Stone after designs by Inigo Jones."
Fan,"18th century fans have a sense of authenticity to them because they often depict contemporaneous life. The depiction of the costumes is detailed, and overall quality of the painting is refined, with a nuanced color palette. In the 19th century, good copies were made, and are sometimes difficult to distinguish. One interesting way to identify the 18th century fans, though, is by the color of the hair, which appears powdered gray rather than a natural color, which was the authentic style of the time, a nuance that the Victorians did not adopt in their copies.This fan is part of a large collection belonging to a Spanish Colonial family."
Bottle,"No better evidence of familiarity with European glass in China need be sought beyond Emperor K’ang His’s own statement that during his reign ""we learned in a short time to make glassware that is superior to that made in the West."" This bottle, Eastern in shape but Venetian in decorative style, must ow itse existence to this familiarity. It is a remarkable translation into the porcelain medium of the sixteenth-century vetro a fili technique: the incorporation into a clear glass matrix of blown rods—usually white, but sometimes colored—to produce a pattern of vertical or spiraling stripes.The bottle is one of only three known models of export porcelain that evoke glass techniques, but it would not have been copied directly from an Italian example since the shape does not occur until later. Venetian glass was widely imitated in northern Europe in the seventeenth century, and the bottle could have been copied from a Dutch glass adaptation of a Venetian model. It could also, however, derive from a version in Delft fa?ence."
Paperweight_in_the_shape_of_a_Qilin,"In the Confucian tradition, a qilin is a mythical creature thought to appear when a sage ruler came to the throne. This exquisitely cast bronze example served as an auspicious ornament or paperweight on a scholar’s desk."
Brush_holder_decorated_with_garden_scene,"Features such as the gourd held by a standing attendant, the peach blossom clasped by another, and the individual riding on the back of a deer suggest that the figures on this brush holder represent tales of people who visited the mountains, inadvertently entered other realms, and transgressed time, respectively. The two gentlemen playing chess may refer to a story about two individuals who played the game for so long that the eggs they had in their pockets disintegrated."
Grooms_and_horses,"In the early Yuan period, when the ruling Mongols curtailed the employment of Chinese scholar-officials, the theme of the groom and horse—one associated with the legendary figure of Bole, whose ability to judge horses had become a metaphor for the recruitment of able government officials—became a symbolic plea for the proper use of scholarly talent. Zhao Mengfu painted this work for the high-ranking Surveillance Commissioner Feiqing, who may have been a government recruiter. Executed in early 1296, shortly after Zhao withdrew from civil service, the sensitively rendered groom may be a self-portrait.The striking geometry of the composition, made up of a series of prominent arcs in the figures of the horse and groom, and framed by the level ground line and vertical inscription, appears to have been constructed with a compass and square. The Chinese term ""compass-square"" (guiju) means ""regulation"" or ""order."" Thus, the painting may also be read as a metaphor for good government and, by extension, a measure of the artist's moral rectitude."
Medallion_with_return_from_a_spring_outing,"The motif of a scholar gentleman riding in a moonlight landscape is also found in Chinese paintings. In this richly carved scene, the scholar rides on horseback while four young attendants carry his supplies and a fifth hastens to open the gate to the family compound. The scholar gentleman is understood to be returning from a spring outing filled with wine and poetry."
Vase_with_archaic-style_patterns,"This elegant bronze vase, with its round body and elongated neck, resembles esteemed ceramics from the Song dynasty. But while porcelain Ding ware features minimal decoration, this vase exudes archaic appeal with a band of triangular blades featuring interior patterns on its neck and a broad band of stylized dragons filled with spirals on its belly."
Elegant_Gathering_in_the_Apricot_Garden,"This handscroll is one of two similar compositions attributed to Xie Huan that document a gathering of nine scholar-officials in Beijing on April 6, 1437. The original composition, prepared for the party's host, Yang Rong (1371–1440), who is depicted wearing a red robe in the first group of seated figures, is now in the Zhenjiang Municipal Museum. This painting, probably made for the senior guest, Yang Shiqi (1365–1444), who is seated in a blue robe next to Yang Rong, is a condensed version executed by one of Xie Huan's associates. In spite of the apparent informality of the subject, the painting is carefully crafted to emphasize the power, prestige, and cultivation of the officials. The men's substantial robes and formal poses underscore the dignity of their positions, and their political ranks are distinguished by their placement in the composition. Those of the greatest status, Yang Shiqi and Yang Rong, are at the center of the composition; guests of lower rank are closer to the periphery of the scroll. The antiques and scholarly paraphernalia surrounding the men suggest their literary accomplishments and aesthetic discernment.Following the painting are poems composed by the participants to commemorate the gathering, beginning with a preface inscribed in a dignified clerical script by Yang Shiqi, the oldest participant and the highest-ranking government official of his day. The Qing official and later owner of the scroll Weng Tonghe (1830–1904) inscribed the mounting in front of the painting with a listing of the nine officials."
Hand_warmer,"Hand warmers, also known as sleeve censers (xiulu), are a luxury personal accessory. Containing a glowing piece of charcoal embedded in ashes, these handheld objects provided welcome warmth in unheated rooms; when incense was added, they also imparted a pleasant fragrance, which would waft from the openwork lid. The mark on its base relates this elegant work to Zhang Mingqi, the most outstanding maker of hand warmers of his time, and beyond."
Dish,"The crisply rendered feline sprawled in spread-eagle position with head regardant, the ring of pearl beading, the design of scrolling leaves alternating with outstretched animals, the wreathlike motif, and the band of concave radiating lotus petals on this celadon dish all demonstrate the very strong influence of Western metalwork on Chinese ceramics in the sixth century."
Pair_of_Ducks,"Intended for use as burial goods, this charming pair of ducks also illustrates the early use of lacquer as a pigment."
Long_Life_to_the_Victory_of_Chairman_Mao's_Art_and_Literature_Revolutionary__Line,This propaganda poster celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of Chairman Mao’s speech at Yan’an on the ways in which art and literature could contribute to the Communist cause. The depicted figures represent the characters from the model operas of the Cultural Revolution.
Panel_with_Set_of_Purses_with_Theme_of_the_“Hundred_Antiques”,"This tapestry-woven textile is a rare example of a set of accessories not yet cut apart or stitched together to form bags and cases. The “hundred antiques” theme on the bags, which includes bronze vessels and inscriptions in an ancient style, demonstrates the late Qing fashion for archaism. The gourd-shaped parts were probably meant for a pomander, and the long rectangles were likely intended for a fan case."
"""The_Archer""_cistern","This water cistern is a rare example of Chinese porcelain with a design attributed to Cornelis Pronk (1691–1759), a Dutch draftsman working for the Dutch East-India Company (VOC). In 1734, the artist was commissioned to make sets of drawings for the decoration of Chinese porcelain, which were sent to China in 1736. Various porcelain dinner services and tea sets in underglaze blue and polychrome enamel were thereafter produced in China and sent back to the Netherlands. Known as “The Archer,” the design on the current piece is among four attributed to Pronk. This work highlights a significant moment when a Western artist became directly involved in creating designs for Chinese export porcelain during the mid-eighteenth century."
"Orchid,_Chrysanthemum,_and_Rock","The young men of the Qing royal family were trained in painting and calligraphy through private instruction and study of the imperial collection. In landscape painting, Pu Jin followed the orthodox styles of the Four Wangs, and in calligraphy he cultivated the elegant script of Wang Xizhi and Zhao Mengfu. According to his seal, Pu was in his forties when he painted this work, so it must date after 1933"
Sutra_box_with_dragons_amid_clouds,"This rectangular box was made to hold Buddhist scriptures in the format of Chinese handscrolls. Depictions of vigorous, golden five-clawed dragons soaring among clouds, symbols of imperial power, cover the box and lid. Notably, the dragon design is first incised into the red surface and then filled with gold. This luxurious object is a product of the imperial workshop of Emperor Yongle."
Rear_View_of_the_Mountain_Villa_for_Watching_Clouds,"Yu Zouyan inherited the manner of Wang Yuanqi from his father, who had studied with Wang’s grandson Wang Chen. Here, he applies Wang Yuanqi’s signature combination of ink texturing with blue and green dots to depict the villa of a prominent scholar-official named Zhang Xianghe."
Jar_with_Abstract_Decoration,"The dramatic, abstract design may be read as alluding to birds or plants, motifs characteristically found on ceramics produced in a wide range of kilns in northern China."
Cup_with_Plum_and_Crescent_Moon,"Often found in the decorative arts in the late thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the motif of a plum blossom in the moonlight was inspired by similar imagery in the poetry of that period."
"Carved_fan,_grapevines_and_calligraphy","In addition to demonstrating the talent of bamboo carver Jin Xiya, this object features painting and calligraphy by important contemporary artists. Jin Xiya’s older brother Jin Cheng, a senior figure in Beijing painting and collecting circles, painted the grapevines. The calligraphy on the back of the fan is by Chen Baochen, a loyalist government official who continued to serve the last emperor even after the fall of the imperial Qing dynasty. Jin Xiya further embellished the fan with two poems by Wu Changshuo (1844–1927)—doyen of the Shanghai art scene—which he carved on its outer ribs."
Bowl,"Pottery with painted decoration is among the most remarkable of the archaeological remains from Neolithic cultures that flourished along the banks of the Yellow River. One of China's earliest and most widespread, the Yangshao culture is divided into two branches: the nuclear Yangshao, located in Henan and Shaanxi provinces, and the subsequent Majiayao (or Gansu Yangshao), situated in Gansu and parts of Qinghai Province. Both branches are subdivided into six phases, named after specific archaeological sites, which share architectural forms, stone implements, and high-fired earthenware. However, the shapes and decorations of these ceramics vary, and earthenware from the northwest is distinguished from that of earlier periods by the complexity and density of the designs. The flowing curvilinear forms painted on this shallow basin typify ceramics associated with the Majiayao phase. On the outside wall, ""hand"" motifs are painted in a natural, fluid brush line; on the inside wall, an ambiguity between figure and ground is created by the prominent role of unpainted areas within the overall design."
The_Third_Nun_of_Mount_Xiang,"Legend has it that, when the third Princess Miaoshan refused marriage to become a Buddhist nun, her angry father destroyed her convent. Rescued by a divine being, she retired to Mount Xiang and eventually achieved enlightenment. When her father fell ill in retribution for killing the nuns, she cured him with an antidote made of her own flesh and eyes. In this colorful print, the princess holds a large whisk that symbolizes detachment from worldly concerns."
Gold_and_Jade,"Chubby boys and multiple visual puns are frequently featured in popular prints. Here, the boy is playing with four fish (yu), which is homophonic with the characters for “plentitude” and “jade.” On his bib is a lotus flower (lian), a pun on “continuity,” which conveys the wish for male offspring to carry on the family lineage. Other auspicious symbols include peaches for longevity and peonies for wealth and honor. To strengthen the wish for extensive happiness, the background is patterned with swastikas, a graphic form of the character denoting “ten thousand” (wan)."
Chinese_bulbuls_on_flowering_crab_apple,"This painting encodes a visual pun called a rebus: the bulbul bird, known as the “white-headed old man” (baitou weng 白頭翁) in Chinese, combined with the crab-apple tree (haitang 海棠) evokes the phrase “white heads at the front of the hall” (tangshang baitou 堂上白頭), an auspicious wish for shared longevity for the matriarch and patriarch of a family. Though bearing a fake inscription and seals of the Northern Song emperor Huizong (1082–1135; r. 1100–25), this fine painting shows qualities of the fourteenth-century painters Wang Yuan and Zhang Zhong and may be dated to that time based on its style."
Bowl_with_Buddhist_Assembly,"Made for use in Japan, either in a Buddhist context or as part of a meal during a Japanese tea ceremony, this charming bowl is painted with a rare scene of a Buddhist assembly."
"Carved_fan,_peony_blossoms_and_calligraphy","This folding fan features exquisite carvings on its outer ribs by Jin Xiya (1890–1979), the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. This work showcase Jin’s virtuosic command of traditional bamboo carving as well as his creative experimentation. His works incorporate compositions from designs contributed by important modern artists, such as Zhao Shuru (1874–1945) and Wu Hufan (1894–1968) on this piece. This fan is further embellished with painting and calligraphy by his contemporary artists—shedding light on the dense web of social and artistic relationships among China’s elite during a time of wrenching change in the mid-twentieth century.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (fan frame #241), the bamboo carving was completed on October 21, 1942."
Ceremonial_halberd_blade_or_finial,The dramatic and imposing shape of this massive blade exemplifies the flamboyant style of bronze decoration in the early Western Zhou dynasty (ca. 1046–771 B.C.) and suggests that it served as a ceremonial weapon or ritual finial.
Taperstick,"As the European market for Chinese porcelain grew, so, too, did the desire for specifically Western forms. In response, Chinese potters looked to European examples in other materials for inspiration. The stepped square-sectioned shape of this porcelain taperstick, for instance, is derived from European metalwork."
Bottle_for_incense_tools,"Implements commonly used for burning incense included a box, a burner, a flat-bowled spoon and tongs, and a vase for storing these utensils. The burners are often modeled after archaic bronze vessels. Although it is not clear if the three Chinese objects displayed here (2015.500.6.22–.24) originally formed a set, all are inscribed with the name of the artist, Hu Wenming, and exhibit the same decorative technique."
"Carved_fan,_blossoming_roses_and_excerpt_from_the_Commentary_on_the_Water_Classic","This work captures a subtle sense of humor of Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. One of the outer ribs depicts a group of foods that ripen with the approach of summer. This subject, known as jianchun, literally, “a farewell meal to spring,” is a common literati theme. In addition to the normal seasonal vegetables and fruits of this season—bamboo shoots and cherries—the artist has inserted a pufferfish (hetun, fugu in Japanese). Consuming these fish can be lethal without professional preparation, but it is a famous delicacy in both China and Japan. The unconventional addition of this fish was undoubtedly intended as a playful surprise! Jin’s archive records that this folding fan was a gift to his teenage daughter, which may explain why such an amusing and personal design was selected.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (fan frame #191), the bamboo carving of spider and bamboo was completed on November 5, 1933, and the carving of spring foods was completed on December 21, 1933."
Dish_with_a_vase_of_flowers,"The extensive use of gilding and the dark blue and red enamels illustrate the Chinese adoption of the Japanese Imari style. This style became popular in Europe in the mid-seventeenth century, when warfare in China disrupted the kilns at Jingdezhen. Once work there resumed, Chinese potters incorporated the Imari style in their repertory in order to appeal to the lucrative European market."
"Carved_fan,_water_pavilion_by_a_pine_bluff_and_calligraphy","This folding fan features exquisite carvings on its outer ribs by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. This work showcase Jin’s sophisticated skill in relief carving. His works incorporate compositions from designs contributed by important modern artists, such as Jin Cheng (1878–1926) on this piece. This fan is further embellished with painting and calligraphy by contemporary artists—shedding light on the dense web of social and artistic relationships among China’s elite during a time of wrenching change, when members of the scholarly elite sought to sustain inherited traditions in the face of a rapidly modernizing world.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (fan frame #44), the bamboo carving was completed on May 25, 1923."
Vase_with_Butterflies,The Chinese term for butterfly (hudie) is also a rebus for the accumulation of blessings.
Dish_with_a_scene_of_tea_cultivation_(one_of_a_pair),"One of a pair of dishes belonged to a table service decorated with scenes of the cultivation of tea. This one depicts rattan being applied to the outside of a container, while on the right a man is packing tea by stomping it down. These cylindrical containers were used to transport the tea to Canton, where it was repacked in metal-lined wooden chests for shipment to Europe and elsewhere. Chinese potters' borrowing of French pottery motifs for the border design speaks to the stylistic cross-currents enabled by the extensive trade in the eighteenth century."
Spearhead_and_Storage_Case_(清__矛頭),"With its pure form and clean lines, this spearhead shows a level of quality and refinement usually reserved for the best sword blades and seldom found on spears or other staff weapons. At the base of its socket there is a braided ring realistically chiseled in high relief. Engraved just above it is a design of a mountains and waves, a symbol of longevity called the Islands of the Immortals."
Puzzle_jug,The model is derived from one originating in English pottery by 1653 and copied at the Dutch Delft factories by the early 18th century.
Dish_with_a_scene_of_tea_cultivation_(one_of_a_pair),"This dish depicts several stages in the production of metal canisters intended to contain tea. These cylindrical containers were used to transport tea to Canton, where it was repacked in metal-lined wooden chests for shipment to Europe and elsewhere."
Incense_burner,"Attributed to Hu Wenming by its mark, this incense burner features delicate patterns rendered through various forms of cold working, including engraving, chiseling, and punching—the characteristic techniques of the bronze master."
Base_for_a_mandala,"Ceremonial mandalas were used in later forms of Buddhism, including Esoteric Buddhism, which flourished in Tibet from the tenth century and was influential at the Chinese court after the fourteenth. This base once supported a three-dimensional mandala that probably comprised small sculptures, models of temples and stupas, or colored sands. The decoration combines lotus flowers (Buddhist symbols of purity) at the top with the Eight Buddhist Treasures at the sides."
"Shouxing,_Stellar_God_of_Immortality","As one of the personified stars, Shouxing is associated with the South Pole in Chinese astronomy and is believed to control the human life span. Longevity, good fortune, and prosperity are considered the three attributes of a good life in traditional Chinese culture."
Incense_burner_with_flowers,"The pattern and form of this incense burner are almost identical to those of one bearing the mark of Hu Wenming’s son, on display nearby. On the basis of this comparison, and the current censer’s evident virtuosity, we can confidently assert that this is at least from Hu Wenming’s workshop, if not from the master’s own hands.Mark雲間胡文明製Made by Hu Wenming from Yunjian."
Woman’s_ceremonial_robe,"In Chinese, the word for “bat” (fu 蝠) sounds like the one for “happiness” (fu 福), so this robe carries a symbolic message of good fortune. The roundels of five interlocking bats surrounding the Chinese character for “longevity” (shou 壽) refer to the “Five Happinesses”: longevity, health, wealth, virtue, and a natural death."
Vase,"This elegant vase has a pear-shaped body with a squarish section, supported on a short splayed foot. Two handles in the shape of animal masks are attached to the sides of its neck, which is embellished with a band of stylized dragons inlaid in silver. On both the front and reverse sides of the vase is a line of poetry by the Tang-dynasty poet Dou Chang (746–825), also inlaid in silver, which reads: Sweeping the snow to plant flowers in the spring; burning the incense to read the classics at night. On the other two sides are silver-inlaid images of an egret and a three-legged toad, which is a symbol of wealth. A two-character mark of Shisou is executed in silver inlay on the exterior of the bottom. The vase is covered with a warm brown patina that bears no trace of being buried underground. Originally, this vessel would have served as a vase for flowers or for holding tongs and spatulas for the practice of incense burning."
Incense_box,"Implements commonly used for burning incense included a box, a burner, a flat-bowled spoon and tongs, and a vase for storing these utensils. The burners are often modeled after archaic bronze vessels. Although it is not clear if the three Chinese objects displayed here (2015.500.6.22–.24) originally formed a set, all are inscribed with the name of the artist, Hu Wenming, and exhibit the same decorative technique."
Sutra_Cover_with_the_Chinese_Character_Shou_(Longevity),Sutra cover with repeating pattern of the Chinese character shou (longevity); green on a red background. Silk twill damask in two colors.
Bottle_vase,"This mallet-shaped bottle once held the tongs and spatula used in traditional Chinese incense ceremonies. Successfully mimicking realgar (a mineral used as a magical material in Daoist practices), this glass vessel is a perfect combination of traditional Chinese taste and newly imported European glassmaking techniques."
Landscape_in_the_manner_of_Dong_Yuan,"This evocative vignette is signed by a certain Lu Kezheng, an obscure artist who has gone unrecorded in histories of Chinese painting. Centering the composition on the lower half of the fan, Lu left the top shrouded in mist, creating a feeling of suspense by withholding a view into the far distance. The painting is dated according to the sixty-year cycle of the premodern Chinese calendar, so it is not possible to know whether it was made in 1591 or sixty years later in 1651, although the latter seems more likely based on its style."
Joint_Landscape,"Shen Zhou, the quintessential Ming scholar-amateur painter, preferred to live in retirement rather than risk the vicissitudes of government service. He devoted much of his later life to an exploration of the brush style of the fourteenth-century recluse-painter Wu Zhen. Shen's painting epitomizes the scholar-amateur tradition of self-expression; by depicting the interior world of the mind and heart, it embodies the essence of Chinese artistic striving. The painting's imagery is about private places: secluded dwellings hidden in the heart of the landscape. Shen's calligraphic brushwork, like handwriting, subtly conveys the writer's mind and personality. Shen's most ambitious landscape composition—the scroll is over fifty-six feet long—it shows the artist systematically reinterpreting Wu Zhen's brush idiom while striving for a new compositional monumentality.The painting remained incomplete at Shen Zhou's death. In 1546 it was rediscovered by Shen's illustrious pupil Wen Zhengming, who added finishing touches. Wen's inscription recounts: ""The composition was already fully realized, but the dotting and washing had not been completed. I, his student, have now finished it. But consider my clumsy effort, how could I add to this 'sable tail'!"""
Mug,"Chinese export porcelain was one of the luxuries deemed essential to a well-appointed eighteenth-century house. Until 1784, when direct trade began between China and America, Chinese porcelain came to the colonies by way of Europe. This mug descended in the Verplanck family of New York."
Tankard_with_Peony_Scroll,"Despite the charming dragonfish handle, the shape of this tankard is not Chinese; it is based on Islamic metalwork, and was made for export."
Joint_calligraphy,"This scroll is a testament to the early friendship and mutual admiration of the two men, both of whom earned their ""presented scholar"" (jinshi) degrees in 1622 and went on to become outspoken exponents of political reform. It opens with a playful description by Huang of the similarities between the two friends' calligraphy. He states that he did not arrive at a style of his own until he studied Ni's writing, but he also recounts how Ni had made the same claim about Huang's influence on his calligraphy. Huang ends by remarking that after Ni became a high official, it was nearly impossible to obtain a piece of calligraphy from him. Ni Yuanlu's response, appended to the same length of satin, takes an equally sarcastic tone. Both men's calligraphic styles derive from orthodox models but have an emphatic angularity—with sharp, ""side-tip"" strokes made by holding the brush obliquely—that is said to reflect their forceful personalities."
Panel_with_the_Chinese_Character_for_Longevity_(Shou),"Perfect for a birthday celebration and probably intended as a gift, this massive panel extends one of the most cherished wishes in Chinese tradition: longevity, in the form of the Chinese character for that blessing, shou. The tapestry is meticulously executed with gold threads that parallel calligraphic effects, including the use of smudged areas at the end of several strokes—a technique known as “flying white” that reveals the mobility and rhythm of brushstrokes found in writing."
Early_Autumn_after_Qian_Xuan,"Yu Jingzhi is one of the best-known female artists to practice traditional Chinese painting in the first half of the twentieth century. Born in Hangzhou, she became familiar with the highly descriptive local tradition of academic painting based on the court art of the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279). She moved to New York in 1936, and held several one-person shows in New York, Boston, and Chicago through the 1960s. This work is a meticulous monochrome copy of Early Autumn, a handscroll in the Detroit Institute of Arts that bears a signature of the early Yuan (1279–1368) master Qian Xuan (ca. 1235–before 1307). Depicting an autumnal lotus pond abuzz with lively inhabitants, the painting juxtaposes life and decay to convey the transient nature of all living things. Zhang Daqian wrote a frontispiece in his striking calligraphy. Lin Yutang contributed a colophon that reads:[Yu] Jingzhi, a female scholar and artist, is descended from a highly cultured family. Though living in the United States for many years, she has never abandoned her former practice. She gave me her copy of Shunju's [Qian Xuan's] painting. It truly captures the feeling that insects, plants, and other myriad creatures all live their lives to the full, even though they are ephemerae between heaven and earth just like me. In the early summer of the yisi year [1965], Lin Yutang inscribed.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)Zhang Daqian (1899–1983)FrontispiecePure Harmony on the Jade Pond""Elder sister"" [Yu] Jingzhi's copy of Qian Shunju's [Qian Xuan, ca. 1235–before 1307] painting is very close to the original. Respectfully inscribed by her junior, Daqian, Zhang YuanLin's colophon reads:[Yu] Jingzhi, a female scholar and artist, is descended from a highly cultured family. Though living in America for many years, she has never abandoned her former practice. She gave me her copy of [Qian Xuan's] painting. It truly captures the feeling that insects, plants, and other myriad creatures all live their lives to the full, even thought they are ephemerae between heaven and earth just like me.(trans. Shi-yee Liu)"
Illustrations_and_Explanations_on_Correct_Cultivation,"This book, compiled by Jiao Hong and illuminated by Ding Yunpeng, illustrates sixty exemplary deeds carried out by historical political figures for the moral instruction of the then heir apparent, Zhu Changluo (r. 1620). The image displayed here tells the story of “Removing Dried Fish from among the Delicacies,” in which the future King Wu (d. 1043 B.C.) of the Zhou dynasty is informed by the bearded tutor Taigong Wang that his craving for dried fish was inappropriate for someone of his status."
Gibbons_Raiding_an_Egret's_Nest,"Taken literally, this painting is a dramatic vignette from nature, in which three gibbons raid an egret’s nest, capturing young birds as their mother circles above in anguish. Symbolically, the animals comprise a rebus, a visual pun in which a phrase is spelled out using pictures. In Chinese, the phrase “three gibbons capture egrets” (san yuan de lu) may also be read as “a triple first gains power,” a wish for success in the three levels of the imperial examinations. Originally mounted as a fan, this exquisite painting would have been the perfect gift for an aspiring scholar preparing for the exams."
Damask_with_Cloud_Palmettes_and_Chinese_Characters,"Trade or diplomacy must have played a role in the life of textiles such as this example (now darkened but originally blue), which, according to records, was found in Egypt. The palmette pattern originated in Central Asia and the eastern Iranian world. Here, it also features a Chinese cloud border and flawlessly rendered versions of the Chinese character for longevity (shou) in the center of and atop each one. Longevity damasks like this piece must have been present in other regions, too, as they probably inspired the designs of some of the rare surviving late thirteenth- to early fourteenth-century carpets of Konya, Turkey."
Morning_Melody,"This print presents an aerial view of the pier of an industrialized port. Beneath a network of iron pipes, people head to work in the early morning. The severe geometry of the design and abstract patterning of the seagulls’ wings give the composition a fascinating modernist edge."
White_Lotus,"According to Zhang's inscription, this painting was executed while he was visiting Zhengdu in his native province of Szechuan."
Bees_and_Camellias,"Qi Baishi painted the camellias. Wang Xuetao, a member of the Beijing Painting Academy who had a reputation for painting insects as well as birds and flowers, added the bees, as noted in his inscription."
Tray_with_dragon_and_Chinese_characters,"This tray is one of the finest products of the official workshops of the Jiajing era. It was probably made in the early part of the reign before Daoist imagery began to dominate at court. The dragon in the center holds up the Chinese character sheng, which means “divine” or “imperial majesty.” The characters above it (fu on the right and bi on the left) generally signify “to add” or “to support.” While they can be used to refer to the emperor’s chief ministers, in this case they may refer to the dragon, a well-known symbol of imperial authority."
"Allaying_the_Summer_Heat_under_Wutong_Trees,_after_Shen_Zhou,_Leaf_from_the_Mustard_Seed_Garden_Painting_Manual,_part_1,_vol._5","The Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual was named after a Nanjing estate of the renowned playwright and novelist Li Yu (1611–1680), whose son-in-law commissioned Wang Gai (1645–1710) to compile the book. Part 1, devoted to landscape painting, was published in 1679. Compared with the earlier manual of the same nature, the Ten Bamboo Studio Collection of Calligraphy and Painting, it takes a more art-historical and didactic approach. This print, taken from a later edition of part 1, was made by using two or three blocks with varying shades of black ink to reproduce a painting by Shen Zhou (1427–1509), a leading artist of the early Ming dynasty (1368–1644) active in Suzhou."
Carved_fan_with_plum-blossom_painting,"Jin Xiya was the most accomplished bamboo carver in modern China. Bamboo’s pliability makes it an ideal surface for reproducing the subtlety of brush and ink via carving, and for this reason the practice was seen as a companion to painting and an elegant pastime for a scholar-artist. This fan and the wrist rests in this case reveal both the expressive potential of the medium and Jin’s unique vision."
Saddle_(gser_sga),"This saddle represents a particular form found in Tibet, one that is Chinese or strongly influenced by Chinese types. It belongs to a small group of closely related saddles that may stem from a single workshop or reflect a specific type developed in one region. Notable features are the lively dragons, chiseled free from the scrollwork ground, and the unusual decorative technique involving silver damascening of the entire surfaces of the saddle plates, with select design elements highlighted by mercury gilding over the silver. Also very distinctive is the use of three layers of decoration: the outer layer of pierced scrollwork with long tendrils deeply undercut to give an appearance of depth, a second layer forming a subsidiary ground underlying each saddle plate and consisting of an iron grill damascened in silver to create a stylized cloud pattern, and a layer of colored cloth directly on top of the wood of the saddle-tree."
Snow_Clearing:_Landscape_after_Li_Cheng,"Defying the dictum of the authoritative theorist Dong Qichang (1555–1636) that ""in painting it is better to be descriptively obscure rather than to be obvious,"" Wang Hui regarded calligraphic abstraction and mimetic representation as ""the two wings of a bird."" Inspired by Li Cheng's (919–967) descriptive idiom of jagged rock formations and spiky ""crab-claw"" wintry trees, which demand representational skill as well as calligraphic discipline, Wang's perfectly controlled lyrical composition—a snowscape of enchanted stillness-celebrates the beauty of nature.Painted for Zhou Lianggong (1612–1672), a high-ranking official who was facing unjust charges of corruption, Wang's choice of the Li Cheng style was significant. Li's winter landscapes had long been viewed as emblems of survival in the face of adversity, so Wang's painting may be read as an expression of sympathy and encouragement."
Lychees,"The cool graphic beauty of Ding's image and of his Shang oracle-bone script express the pleasure he felt upon receiving lychees from a friend traveling in the south, where the fruit grows.Shou Xi's poem (on the left) describes how the Tang emperor Xuanzong (r. 712-56) employed the imperial messenger service to bring ripe lychees from Canton to his favorite concubine, Yang Guifei, at the capital, Chang'an (modern Xi'an)."
Odes_of_the_State_of_Bin,"This handscroll is one of a set that illustrates the 305 poems in the Shijing (The Book of Odes), a work traditionally believed to have been compiled by Confucius (551–479 B.C.). The scrolls were made at the court of Gaozong (r. 1127–62), the first emperor of the Southern Song dynasty, and the transcriptions they bear, probably inscribed by either a scribe or a consort, are written in Gaozong's regular-script style. The accompanying paintings are the work of Ma Hezhi, a court artist known for his ""orchid-leaf"" brushstroke, a distinctive type of undulating brush line.The poems illustrated in this scroll are known as the Odes of the State of Bin, for they were believed to have been the songs of Bin (in modern Shensi Province), the ancient homeland of the founders of the Zhou dynasty (ca. 1100–256 B.C.). These odes are the last in the section known as Guofeng (""Airs from the States""), which contains poems gathered from all over the realm so that the Zhou king might learn what his people were thinking and feeling."
"Landscape,_after_Ni_Zan,_Leaf_from_the_Mustard_Seed_Garden_Painting_Manual,_part_1,_vol._5","The Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual was named after the Nanjing estate of the renowned playwright and novelist Li Yu (1611–1680), whose son-in-law commissioned Wang Gai (1645–1710) to compile the book. Part 1, devoted to landscape painting, was published in 1679. Compared with the earlier manual of the same nature, the Ten Bamboo Studio Collection of Calligraphy and Painting, it takes a more art-historical and didactic approach. This print, taken from a later edition of part 1, was printed from two or three blocks using varying shades of black ink to reproduce a painting by Ni Zan (1306–1374), one of the four masters of the late Yuan period (1271–1368)."
Landscapes_after_old_masters,"In 1674, Wang Hui painted an album of twelve leaves for his teacher Wang Shimin. Though already in his forties when he made the album, Wang Hui still attempted to impress his mentor with his range and technical facility. Three years later, Wang Shimin made his own album in response, painted in a broader style suited to his failing vision. Portions of the two original albums were lost over the centuries, and a collector combined the surviving ten leaves by Wang Hui and two by Wang Shimin in the album on view here—a touching artifact of the unique bond between a teacher and his student.Wang Hui (1632–1717)ColophonQing dynasty (1644–1911), dated 1714Forty years after he painted this album for his teacher Wang Shimin, Wang Hui saw it again in the home of Wang Shimin’s grandson. He recorded his feelings in this colophon:In 1674, when master Fengchang [Wang Shimin] asked me to do this album, he was eighty-three sui [eighty-two years old]. That was forty years ago; now I am eighty-three. The master’s grandson Qiuya has taken this out to show me. Examining again my earlier inscriptions done so many years ago I am overwhelmed with sadness and feel that the bonds of brush and ink that connect me with three generations of the Wang family cannot have been an accident.—Translation by Shi-yee Liu"
"Figures,_flowers,_and_landscapes","This album has four paintings by the late Ming master Chen Hongshou and seven by his son Chen Zi. The first is one of the most iconic images in Chen Hongshou’s oeuvre—a mournful self-portrait depicting the artist drowning his sorrows in wine. It is followed by paintings of landscapes, birds, flowers, and figures. The combining of diverse subjects in a single album was known as “zahua,” and it was an opportunity for a painter to demonstrate versatility. A zahua album is meant to delight the viewer with variety, as a new subject appears with each turn of the page.The paintings may have been brought together into an album by a collector at a later date, or even perhaps by Chen Zi himself. Comparison of the two men’s work reveals that while Chen Zi worked in his father’s style, he could not match his father’s fluidity or quirky charm."
"Orchids,_Bamboo,_and_Rocks","Shitao arrived in Beijing in 1690 to seek imperial patronage. He soon took Boerdu (1649–1708), great-grandson of the Qing founder Nuerhachi (1559–1626), as his disciple in painting. It was through Boerdu that Shitao contributed to this joint work with the preeminent painter Wang Hui, who left his inscription on the rock. Shitao’s tame representation of bamboo and orchids shows his respect for orthodox courtly taste. In his inscription, written in archaic clerical script, he composed a poem on bamboo and orchids, then added this postscript:Mr. Wen [Boerdu] sent me some paper and asked me to paintorchids and bamboo, adding that a master painter would completethe painting with rock images. Therefore I left a blank area forhis magical final touch. Submitted for Mr. Wen’s instruction.cat. no. 77"
Boats_Moored_in_Wind_and_Rain,"Yan Ciyu, to whom this fan was once attributed, is represented today by a single signed album leaf now in the Freer Gallery, Washington, D.C. In contrast to the restrained and dramatic manner of the Freer landscape, which is painted in the blue-and-green style of Li Tang (ca. 1070s–ca. 1150s), the flattish, formalistic design of the Crawford painting, with its heavily outlined trees and rocks and sharply silhouetted hills, is indebted to the stylistic developments of Ma Yuan and Xia Gui (both act. ca. 1190–1225)."
Landscapes_in_the_styles_of_old_masters,"Wang Jian, teacher of Wang Hui and close friend of Wang Shimin, stands at the center of the group of scholar-artists who endeavored to establish a new orthodoxy in painting through the vigorous study of past masters. In this gemlike album, Wang re-created in miniature scale the idioms of Song (960–1279) and Yuan (1279–1368) dynasty masters. Conscious of his own role as a transmitter, Wang inscribed each leaf with the name of the artist whose style he interpreted together with an appropriate couplet by the Tang dynasty poet Du Fu (712–770)."
One_hundred_water_buffalo,"Myriad water buffalo spread across this gentle river landscape in scenes of play, work, and relaxation. Some are guided gently by country oxherd boys, while others are ridden around and through the cool waters, lounge by the riverside, or scratch their weary hides. While the ox sometimes featured in Buddhist images, this painting presents the ox and oxherd as symbols of the simple joys of life in river country."
In_the_Palace,"In the Palace, a freehand copy of a tenth-century handscroll by Zhou Wenju, depicts daily life among the palace ladies of the Southern Tang emperor Li Yu (r. 961–75), a renowned patron of the arts who trained his ladies to sing and act out his lyrics.This twelfth-century copy is not a later painting in an ancient style but an ancient work reincarnated in a later vernacular. In making his copy, the artist chose the “plain-drawing” (baimiao) style of Li Gonglin (ca. 1049–1106), whose nephew commissioned the work in 1140. Concentrating on line, the painter eliminated the colors found in the original. Figures are drawn in the type of strongly calligraphic line admiringly characterized by Song critics as “iron wire.” In this style, the brush tip is kept at the center of the brushstroke to create taut fluid lines.The twelfth-century painting was later divided into four sections. The Metropolitan’s scroll is the fourth section. The three other sections are in the Bernard Berenson collection, near Florence, Italy; the Cleveland Museum of Art; and the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University."
"Carved_fan,_birds_amid_autumn_maple_leaves","This folding fan features exquisite carvings on its outer ribs by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. This work showcase Jin’s sophisticated skill in intaglio carving. His works incorporate compositions from designs contributed by important modern artists, such as the calligraphy by Shou Shigong (1885-1950) and painting of sailboats by Jin Cheng (1878–1926) on this piece.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (fan frame #103), the bamboo carving was completed on April 11, 1925."
"Carved_fan,_calligraphy","This folding fan features carvings on its outer ribs by Jin Xiya (1890–1979), the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. It conveys the artist’s sophisticated skill in relief carving. In addition to the extraordinary carving, this fan also bears calligraphy by notable calligrapher Shen Yinmo (1887–1971). Taken together, this work shed light on the dense web of social and artistic relationships among China’s elite during a time of wrenching change in the formation of modern China.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (fan frame #337), the bamboo carving was completed on November 29, 1945."
"Tray_with_Chinese_characters,_bats,_and_fruits","The dense, multilayered surface of this dish is typical of Qianlong-period carved lacquer. At center is the character for longevity (shou) surrounded by first a circle of bats and then a lobed cartouche containing the phrase “ten thousand longevities and eternal spring” (wan sui chang chun). The outer border of fruits and flowers also refers to long life. The dish was likely presented as a birthday present or used to proffer and display a gift."
"Carved_fan,_branches_of_blossoming_plum_and_calligraphy","This folding fan features exquisite carvings on its outer ribs by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. His carvings incorporate compositions from designs contributed by important modern artists, such as Gao Shifeng (1876–1960) on this piece.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (fan frame #283), the bamboo carving was completed on December 24, 1943."
Travelers_in_a_Wintry_Forest,"During the tenth and eleventh centuries, majestic trees rivaled panoramic landscapes as sources of artistic inspiration. The hermit-painter Jing Hao (act. 900–930), for example, saw in the pine tree ""the moral character of the virtuous man,"" while the preeminent landscape master Li Cheng (919–967) is said to have painted desolate scenes of winter because ""men of virtue are now found only in the wilderness.Travelers in a Wintry Forest follows a well-known composition by Li Cheng as described by Mi Fu (1051–1107) in his History of Painting. The scene is a microcosm of the natural cycle of growth and decay, with the great pine, symbolizing the virtuous gentleman, surrounded by trees ranging from youthful saplings to a shattered ancient hulk. The stoic silence of the wintry forest is matched by the unyielding spirit of the scholar on his donkey—the noble recluse who has entered the mountains to rediscover in nature the moral order that is lost in the human world."
Raising_the_Alms-Bowl,"This painting tells the story of how the Buddha converted the child-eating demon Guizimu (Hariti, in Sanskrit) to the Buddhist faith. To show her the pain that her abductions and carnage were causing, the Buddha imprisoned one of Guizimu’s children under a magical bowl; the chaotic scene shows Guizimu’s demon armies futilely trying to lift the bowl and free the child. The Buddha watches, hovering in mid-air, backed by flames and accompanied by luohans and other followers. This painting was made with the intent to deceive: the many early collection seals are fake and were added to make the painting look older (and more valuable) than it was."
The_Four_Seasons,"The theme of this painting is the progress of the seasons from spring to winter. The scroll begins with a scene of jagged peaks and mist-filled valleys: trees are tinged with the delicate red of new leaf buds and blossoms; turbulent mountain streams suggest the melting snow of early spring. The composition next opens into a broad vista of a lake whipped by a summer rainstorm. Autumn, with its clear skies, is a time for climbing, and the perspective shifts to high mountains with a view across distant pinnacles. In the final scene, wintry sky and water appear dark against snow-covered mountains, where only the pine and bamboo remain green.In its combination of eclectic Northern and Southern Song compositional elements and brush techniques, this landscape belongs to the revival of Song styles patronized by the conservative early Ming court. Kept alive during the fourteenth century by such artists as Tang Di (ca. 1296–1364), this style gained new prominence during the early fifteenth century in the hands of such artists as Dai Jin, Zhou Wenjing, and Li Zai."
A_Summer_Idyll,"This work and another in the Xinxiang County Museum, Henan Province, are the only known calligraphic hanging scrolls associated with Zhao Mengfu. In both works,the large cursive script, written in a bold dry-brush, ""flying-white"" technique, and the loose structure of individual characters suggest a Ming-dynasty date.The poem, which is recorded in Zhao's collected works, is the first in a series of three entitled ""Three Quatrains on Some Immediate Events."" It describes the leisurely life of the artist in early summer:Through the loosely woven bamboo curtainfrom Xiang, I see a sparse wavy pattern.In my newly tailored white sackcloth gown,gentle heat rises.The shadow of the sun over the courtyardgrows longer, and visitors stay away.About the pond the grass is fragrant,and swallows fly in pairs.(trans. Wen Fong)"
Landscape_in_the_style_of_Fan_Kuan,"Once considered a work of the Ming period (1368–1644), this monumental landscape in the style of Fan Kuan can be dated stylistically to the twelfth century. A mountainscape built up in three stages, the painting shows a boat landing at the foot of a tree-covered bluff in the foreground; travelers heading toward a temple retreat in the middle ground; and mountain peaks rising in the background. The composition, showing mountain masses floating amid and unified by mist, compares closely to works firmly dated to the twelfth century. For example, the depiction of rocks and trees partially obliterated by mist and the blurring and fusing of texture strokes of different ink values reveal the artist’s familiarity with the paintings of Guo Xi (ca. 1000–ca. 1090). The angular rock faces with “raindrop” texture dots and the scrubby foliage on the peaks are characteristic of paintings in the style of Fan Kuan."
Table_Service,"This object belongs to a large dinner service (10.149.1–.248) bearing the Townley family coat-of-arms. The service, probably ordered by Justice Samuel Chase (1741–1811) of Annapolis, Maryland, displays the enamel-painted arms of Margaret Townley, Chase's aunt."
Necklace,"This collection of largely ethnographic jewelry includes examples from cultures in South America, North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa and dates from the Pre-Columbian period to the twentieth century. Owned by renowned art collector and fashion enthusiast Muriel Kallis Newman, the collection represents her knowledge and appreciation of a wide range of jewelry design and making traditions. Numerous items in her collection are composite artifacts made from various cultures and time periods reappropriated as modern jewelry creations by or for Muriel. It is important to note that Newman wore many of the pieces in the collection, interpreting them to suit and express her own singular, often avant-garde style."

Goqing,"The decorative V-shaped stone slab suspended in the teakwood frame is made of jade to was used in ritual. The frame and the carved jade are decorated with bats (symbols of good fortune), dragons, a phoenix and fish."
Portraits_of_Emperors_of_Successive_Dynasties,"Portraits of past emperors, displayed in the imperial ancestral temple, served an important function in state rituals. In Qing times, the veneration of former rulers by Manchu emperors served the additional purpose of confirming the Qing dynasty's legitimacy in the succession of China's ruling houses.These miniature portraits by the court artist Yao Wenhan are a typical product of the Qianlong Painting Academy. Based on earlier full-scale works, the albums may have been made as presentation pieces or as a handy reference showing China's most famous legendary and historical rulers. The pronounced use of shading in the depiction of many of the faces shows the influence of Western chiaroscuro modeling techniques introduced into China by Jesuit artists serving the Qing court."
Chessmen_(32),"The white king portrays Napoleon, easily recognized by his posture and costume. His queen, however, cannot be identified as Josephine or Marie-Louise, and her dress is at least semi-Oriental. In many Chinese sets for export the likeness of the king is that of a well-known character, but the likeness does not extend to his consort. The opposing, Chinese, ruler is not recognizable, as is customary. The white bishop is evidently meant to be such; a Chinese sage is his opponent. Apart from these capital pieces there is considerable confusion. The four knights are the same shape, differentiated only by color; so are the rooks (elephants with castles). Somewhat archaistic in view of Napoleon's presence, the pawns are pikemen on the Chinese side, and their opponents carry swords and round shields, echoing some of the figures of Indian export sets. The set was undoubtedly made for French consumption, as the Chinese varied the nationality of the king to suit the allegiance of their visitors."

Bodhidharma_in_meditation,"Chinese white porcelain reached another summit during the seventeenth century in Dehua, a hilly region in the southeast coastal province of Fujian. The porcelain from the Dehua kilns is characterized by a thick, lustrous, clear glaze over an ivory-white paste body. Depicting the monk credited with founding the Chan (Zen in Japanese) sect of Buddhism, this sculpture perfectly illustrates these characteristic features of Dehua ware.Widely exported to Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth century, Dehua white porcelain is generally referred to by French term blanc de chine, or “China white,” in Western writing."
Tiger_Hill,"Artists in sixteenth-century Suzhou often painted the scenic sites of their hometown. Such paintings were intended to celebrate the beauty of Suzhou—it was then, as now, one of the most beautiful cities in the world—but also to highlight the layers of historical and religious significance that made these places famous. This intimate painting depicts Tiger Hill, a destination northwest of the city that was the frequent subject of poems and paintings by local literati who traveled there in search of inspiration and relaxation. Lu Zhi, one of the leading scholar-painters of his day, used his signature technique of layering angular brushstrokes to build up mountain forms, creating an almost cubist effect. The long colophon is a set of poems about Tiger Hill by the Song-dynasty poet Jiang Tang (980–1054), here transcribed by the scholar Xu Weiren (1788–1855)."

Duke_Wen_of_Jin_Recovering_His_State,"This handscroll tells the story of the exile and return to power of Chonger, duke of the ancient state of Jin. Driven from his home by a succession crisis, Chonger spent nineteen years in exile seeking support from other states before returning in triumph to assume the title Duke of Jin in 636 BCE. Though unsigned, the painting has long been attributed to the court painter Li Tang, who served in both the Northern and Southern Song painting academies. The calligraphy, executed in the style of Emperor Gaozong, was probably written by a scribe on his behalf."
Stag_Hunt,"As he hits his prey, the hunter on his pony is ready with a second arrow in his left hand. The powerful horse is shown in an animated “flying gallop,” with bulging muscles suggesting the frenzied excitement of the chase, while the delicately rendered deer presents a moving portrait of a gentle victim and death.Hunting was an ancient aristocratic pastime, especially favored as a pictorial theme by the naturalized nomad painter Prince Li Zanhua, to whom this painting was once attributed. By the late Northern Song period, scholar-critics had begun to treat the hunting scene as an allegory of violence and greed. Both the painting style and the psychological interpretation of the subject matter suggest an early-twelfth-century date for this work.An unusually fine collection of colophons is attached to the scroll. In 1352 Zhu Derun (1294–1365) attributed the painting to Li Zanhua. Three other fourteenth-century colophons are followed by a poem by the great Suzhou painter Shen Zhou (1427–1509). The senselessness of violence, as portrayed by the hunt, is lamented by all the colophon writers"
Quatrain_on_fishermen,"Following his abdication in 1162, Gaozong lived another twenty-five years in retirement with his wife, the empress Wu (1115–1197), devoting himself to scholarly and artistic pursuits. This poem, written in running script, may be a late work. The poem embellishes a round silk fan, a favored new format in Southern Song imperial art. By the late twelfth century, all silk fans were embellished with a painting on one side and a poem on the other, the image and the words complementing each other. The retired emperor often inscribed fans to bestow as gifts. The poems, when not original works by the emperor, were taken from anthologies of Tang or early Song poetry.This poem, describes the life of the fisherman-recluse:Small fishing boats are moored along the sandbanks of a stream.Calling to one another, the boatmen have gone to the wine-house.Turning in their catch of perch to buy drink,They retire to the song of the oars, to sleep in the rosy mist.(Wen C. Fong, trans., in Beyond Representation: Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 8th-14th Century [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1992], p. 227)"

Illustration_of_Su_Shi’s_“Second_Rhapsody_on_Red_Cliff”,"The subject and style of this fan painting exemplify late Yuan scholarly taste. The picture illustrates the celebrated ""Second Ode on the Red Cliff"" by the Northern Song scholar-artist Su Shi (1036–1101), in which a poet dreams that a crane he saw during an outing was a Daoist immortal in disguise. The rough brush idiom is based on the traditions of Dong Yuan (act. ca. 940–75) and Juran (act. ca. 960–95), but the patterned texture strokes, moss dots, and brisk rhythmic arcs of the water reeds recall the fourteenth-century master Sheng Mou."
Bottle_with_Peony_Scroll,The structured surface of this bottle ultimately derives from the Islamic cultures of West Asia. The designs painted on the surface of the bottle also illustrate the complicated ties between China and other regions in the fourteenth century: the patterns on the neck parallel the cloud-collar designs often found in textiles and clothing in China and the Islamic world; the scrolling peonies that decorate the center of the bottle derive from longstanding Chinese traditions; and the stylized lotus petals on the base allude to imagery found in Indo-Himalayan art.
Leaf_from_the_Imperially_Commissioned_Illustrations_of_Agriculture_and_Sericulture,"In China emperors and empresses traditionally inaugurated the season for agriculture and sericulture in state rituals that acknowledged the importance of these activities to the prosperity of society. This print comes from an album with forty-six illustrations on the cultivation of grain and silk. It was commissioned by the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662–1722) and designed by Jiao Bingzhen after a twelfth-century model, with the addition of the emperor’s poem and seals."
Vase_with_flowers_and_birds_of_the_four_seasons,"Seasonal references abound in Chinese art, and the four different scenes featuring flowers and birds painted here allude to the passing of time and changes in nature. For example, tree peonies and pheasants are a harbinger of spring, kingfishers over a lotus pond mark summer, chrysanthemums and hibiscus imply autumn, and magpies on a blooming prunus tree symbolize winter and offer a pun of happiness arriving in Chinese tradition."
Flask_with_Lotus_Pond,"Introduced with Buddhism in which it is symbolic of purity, the lotus is an important flower in Chinese art and symbolizes summer, longevity, elegance, and other virtues."
Vase,"As had been the case earlier in Europe, when American collectors such as Altman began to collect Chinese porcelains, they often commissioned elegant mounts to hold and display these precious pieces."
Kettle_and_stand,"This kettle set illustrates the artistic exchange between China and Europe during the eighteenth century. Its form is a typical European design commonly found in silver ware; however, this example was painted with traditional Chinese flower sprays in polychrome enamels over a copper alloy body. Produced in Canton (now Guangzhou), kettle sets like this one were exported to satisfy European tastes for Chinese wares."
Knotted_dragon_pendant,"This pendant takes the shape of a dragon with a sinuous body grooved to resemble twisted rope. Its elegant curves illustrate the extraordinary talent and skill of early Chinese jade carvers, in whose hands hard, intractable jade seems a supple and malleable material."
Dish_with_Blossoming_Plum_and_Crescent_Moon,"Suggestive of an evening in early spring, and a subject of Chinese poetry, the theme of a flowering plum under a crescent moon first appears in Chinese ceramics in the twelfth century. On this dish, a dramatic rock of the type that was mined at Lake Tai on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, and used for gardens, has been added to the scene."
"Bamboo_in_Mist,_after_Ge_Zhongxuan_(ca._1577–ca._1636),_Leaf_from_the_Ten_Bamboo_Studio_Collection_of_Calligraphy_and_Painting","The Ten Bamboo Studio Collection of Calligraphy and Painting is one of the earliest color-printed picture collections in China and the first to capture the subtle nuance of brushstrokes. It is named after the Ten Bamboo Studio of the scholar Hu Zhengyan in Nanjing. Hu compiled calligraphies and paintings by past and contemporary artists, then had them carved and printed by a skilled team in eight volumes with 186 pictures and 140 matching poems. These leaves are among the earliest and finest imprints of existing versions from the original blocks."

Plaque_with_the_five_poisonous_creatures,"This painted enamel plaque is decorated with five poisonous creatures that feature in Chinese folklore: from left to right, the centipede, toad, snake, scorpion, and spider. It was likely used as a decoration and a charm with magic power. Although the animals can seem harmful, Chinese people believe that they can keep the house and its residents safe by dispelling evil influences."
Vase_with_European_women_and_children,"Profusely ornate, this vase reflects Chinese interests in European imagery and pictorial techniques during the eighteenth century. Chinese artists used a new palette of opaque enamels to create shading that could replicate Western painting styles. The stippling on the sky and ground, as well as the horizontal lines on the surface of the body of water, may indicate that a European copperplate etching served as the pictorial source for the vignette."
Saltcellar,"Chinese export porcelain was one of the luxuries deemed essential to a well-appointed eighteenth-century house. Until 1784, when direct trade began between China and America, Chinese porcelain came to the colonies by way of Europe. This saltcellar was part of a large service that descended in the Verplanck family of New York."
Bodhisattva_(Maitreya)_with_crossed_ankles,"This statue is most likely the Bodhisattva Maitreya. The closest examples are the Maitreya statues in Caves 5 and 25 (?) at Yungang, Shanxi Province. An early example is the Maitreya in Cave 275 at Dunhuang, which dates to early fifth century. All these statues share the same attributes, a seated posture with crossed legs, a crown with a Buddha image, and the right hand held upright with the palm facing forward in a gesture of allaying fears (abhaya mudra).The representation of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin) in Chinese Buddhist art first appeared in the late fourth century. By the late sixth century, it had assumed its standard image, characterized by the water flask and lotus stem, or willow branch, in his hand, and sometimes an image of the Buddha on his crown, which, at Yungang, was on the crown of Maitreya instead.At an early stage of its development, Avalokiteshvara was often depicted as an attendant of Maitreya, as is seen in the Maitreya mural at Bingling Temple in Tianshui, Gansu, which dates to the early fifth century. It was not represented by itself until the late sixth century, when the worship of Avalokiteshvara gradually gained popularity.More investigation is needed to confirm Cave 25 to be the original locus, as proposed on the catalogue card. In their seminal work on Yungang, Sekino and Tokiwa list 20 caves that range from late fourth to late fifth or early sixth century. They didn’t mention Cave 25, which is little recorded in Chinese sources."

Until 1784, when direct trade began between China and America, Chinese porcelain came to the colonies by way of Europe. This dish was part of a large service that descended in the Verplanck family of New York."
Dish,"Chinese export porcelain was one of the luxuries deemed essential to a well-appointed eighteenth-century house. Until 1784, when direct trade began between China and America, Chinese porcelain came to the colonies by way of Europe. This dish was part of a large service that descended in the Verplanck family of New York."
Sutra_Cover_with_Pattern_of_Double-Gourd_Shapes_Containing__Auspicious_Chinese_Characters,Sutra cover with repeating pattern of double-gourd shapes containing the auspicious Chinese characters daiji (great good fortune) and ping’an (peace); yellow on a red background. Silk twill damask in two colors.
Bowl,"Chinese export porcelain was one of the luxuries deemed essential to a well-appointed eighteenth-century house. Until 1784, when direct trade began between China and America, Chinese porcelain came to the colonies by way of Europe. This bowl descended in the Verplanck family of New York."

Amphora_with_dragon-shaped_handles,"This wine container reflects the cosmopolitanism of Chinese art in the seventh and eighth centuries. Its ovoid body and tall neck recall the shape of Greco-Roman amphoras made in the eastern Mediterranean, while its animal-headed handles allude to versions in Persian and Central Asian metalwork. But the fine buff glaze of its stoneware is distinctively local, and the handles’ animal heads have turned into Chinese dragons."
Mug,"Chinese export porcelain was one of the luxuries deemed essential to a well-appointed eighteenth-century house. Until 1784, when direct trade began between China and America, Chinese porcelain came to the colonies by way of Europe. This mug descended in the Verplanck family of New York."

Scholar_Rock_(The_Mirage_Garden),"Zhang plays with transmuting a revered art form—Chinese scholars’ rocks—through the use of industrial materials to reflect upon China’s cultural identity in contemporary conditions. This piece recreates a garden rock in purple silicone, playfully demonstrating how Chinese traditions may evolve within a new global context. According to the artist, the work, as “a societal landscape specific to our time,” comments on the sometimes incongruous collision of cultures that is modern China."
"Wenchang,_Stellar_God_of_Literature","Wenchang is one of a host of personified or embodied stars found in Chinese culture. Associated with literature and, by extension, scholarship and knowledge, Wenchang is part of a constellation of six stars near the Big Dipper."
Red_lotus_and_fish,"Tang Guang’s name is little recorded in Chinese painting history, but this work reveals that he was a sensitive practitioner of the Piling School manner of flower painting. More than just a decorative work, this painting carries an auspicious new year’s message: in Chinese, “lotus” (lian 蓮) sounds like “year” (nian 年), while “fish” (yu 魚) sounds like “abundance” (yu 餘). Taken together, the meaning is “abundance through the years” (niannian youyu 年年有餘)."
Stem_bowl_with_lotus_pattern,"Inspired by Islamic aesthetics, blue-and-white porcelain expanded the color range of Chinese ceramics. According to some textual records, such porcelain was disdained as a vulgar product among art connoisseurs during the late fourteenth century, when monochromatic wares were most favored."
Pansy,"Xie's flower studies include a number of different types of flowers that cannot be found in traditional Chinese paintings or gardens, such as the pansy shown here."
Artificial_Rock_#10,"The strangely eroded rocks long revered by Chinese scholars were typically formed through geologic processes. Connoisseurs appreciated these natural sculptures for many of the same reasons they admired calligraphy: the sense of dynamic form, energy, and the interplay of positive and negative space. Artisans also produced facsimiles of naturally occurring rocks in various materials, including jade, glass, and ceramic. Zhan extends this tradition into the present day by recreating a scholar’s rock in an industrial medium. He began by molding sheets of stainless steel around the surface of a traditional Chinese scholar’s rock, then removed these sheets, welded them together, and burnished the surface until the seams disappeared. The resulting work challenges us to redefine the parameters of tradition and to ask how tradition sustains itself by evolving in the contemporary world."
The_Two_Goddesses_of_the_Xiang_River,"Invoking tradition to create a new Chinese art that served contemporary needs, Fu practiced figure painting to explore the different qualities of brush lines, which he regarded to be a distinctive character of Chinese painting. The two goddesses of the Xiang River from the Nine Songs became Fu’s most famous images of archaic beauty."
Portrait_of_the_Priest_Hongyi,"This image, dated to the first day of the Chinese New Year in 1943, pays homage to Feng's mentor, Hongyi, who died in 1942. Hongyi, whose secular name was Li Shutong, was the earliest Chinese artist to receive training in Western painting in Japan and one of the pioneers in modern art education. Li was also the first Chinese artist to explore modern woodcut techniques, introducing graphics into Chinese newspapers and stressing the importance of teaching commercial art. Disillusioned by the corruption and chaos he saw around him, Li became a Buddhist monk in 1918. Feng's portrait is drawn in a starkly simple outline style in which the lines function descriptively rather than calligraphically. Hongyi is shown looking straight at the viewer, his openness and goodness reflected in his warm smile and relaxed pose."
Irkutsk_Airport,"The image of an airport is here transformed into a symbol of international relations, as the artist explained in his inscription:Hub of Chinese and Soviet civil aviation—my impression of the Irkutsk Airport. In May and August of this year [1957], the delegation of the Chinese Artists Association twice passed through this airport at night. Chinese airplanes landed incessantly as Soviet planes continued to fly east. The close friendship of the two countries could be felt at this airport. On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Socialist October Revolution, I painted this to record my impression.—Trans. Anita Chung"
Buddha,"The plumpness of this Buddha’s face and body, together with the draped robes and waisted pedestal, are typical of Chinese sculpture from the late seventh to early eighth century. The inscription on the base identifies the figure as Amitabha, a celestial Buddha who presides over the Western Paradise, but some scholars have suggested that the inscription may have been added later."
Landscape,"Although he was well versed in Western methods of rendering spatial recession, Xie's ability to reduce a landscape to a series of minimally shaded contours reflects his traditional Chinese bias for the linear depiction of form."
"Twin_Pines,_Level_Distance","This spare, enigmatic scene represents a revolutionary redirection in Chinese painting. Zhao Mengfu reduces his ""painted"" landscape to a set of calligraphic brush conventions, with the rocks executed in ""flying-white"" cursive and the pines outlined in unmodulated seal script. He thus rejects illusionistic representation and relies instead on expressive brush lines to imbue his imagery with personal meaning.Zhao underscores his commitment to this new approach by adding a title to the right of his pines and writing a long inscription on top of the distant mountains at the left side of the composition, making it clear that his painting is not merely about landscape scenery.Despite his adherence to this new style, Zhao chooses a traditionally significant subject. In Chinese art, pine trees have long been emblems of survival. By representing them here, Zhao may be referring to his own political survival under the Mongol occupation, as well as to the endurance of Chinese culture under foreign rule."
Landscape,"Seen from a distance, this work looks like a traditional Chinese landscape painting, made with brush and ink. Only when you get close can you see that it was done entirely in pencil, with layers of hatch marks standing in for the washes and modulated lines of the supple Chinese brush. This kind of playful inversion is at the heart of Shao’s artistic practice, though it most often finds form in his furniture designs—the chair behind you is an example—which appropriate classical forms and materials to create whimsical new ideas."
Nandina,"The Nandina, called Southern Heavenly Bamboo (Nantianzhu) in Chinese, has a range of auspicious meanings. Its profusion of red berries symbolizes abundance, while the similarity of the words for “bamboo” (zhu 竹) and “wish” (zhu 祝) makes the image of the plant suitable for use in a range of rebuses, or multipart visual puns."
Lotus,"After teaching painting and art history in Shanghai in the early 20s, Pan Tianshou went to Japan to study new pedagogical methods. He returned convinced that the salvation of Chinese painting lay in serving its own principles, not the techniques and media of foreign ateliers. Writing in 1926, he attributed the interest Chinese painters had in modern European painting to increasing tendencies in the West toward Chinese purity of line and color and ""spiritual taste"". He opposed the New Culture Movement of the 30s, and his paintings are the most compelling argument for his case that Chinese tradition offers the means for a truly modern Chinese style. They reflect his study of the carved-line calligraphic scripts; he shows himself rooted firmly in the lineage of Zhao Zhiqian and Wu Changshuo, the latter a friend in Shanghai. The boldness and emotional intensity of his work belong wholly to the 20th century.The poem that accompanies this painting reads:The glistening dewdrops have formed on the jade screen.Reflection from the resplendent lotus turns the leaves to read.Liulang [the lotus] is so dissolute when drunk.who put him into the green tent?[Trans. Ellsworth et al, Later Chinese Painting]"
Golden_Gourds,"In this painting Gao Jianfu thoroughly integrated Chinese and Western techniques. While utilizing calligraphically energized brushwork, Gao adopted a fundamentally Western approach to modeling forms, emphasizing the tree trunk as revealed by patterns of light and shadow."
Odes,"For a year in his mid-twenties, the photographer Taca Sui dedicated himself to the study of China’s most ancient poetry collection, The Book of Odes (Shijing). Inspired by the poems, which have long been considered a window into early Chinese civilization, Sui took a series of photographs in northern China, in the regions eulogized in the Shijing, which he then arranged into albums. Sui’s photographs follow the suggestive, elliptical nature of the poems: the images seem to hover on a pregnant pause or a strange moment of coincidence. Sui draws in equal measure on modern artists’ books and Chinese albums, creating a new hybrid form of contemporary art."
Immortal_Rabbit,"The inscription reads:Clear moonlight illuminates the jade rabbit.His pure whiteness lights up the cold toad.[Trans. from Ellsworth et al, Later Chinese Painting]"
Seated_Woman,"Lin Fengmian's debt to Matisse is clear in this work. His reasons for finding Matisse so compelling lay in his training in the principles of Chinese art: economy of line, decorative value of pattern, and use of empty space as form. Lin produced this work after 1977, when he was living in Hong Kong."
Melons_and_Gourds,"Kong Xiaoyu, a woman, painted both in traditional Chinese brush styles and as evidenced in this fan, in styles drawing on Western methods of chiaroscuro and perspective."
Dream_of_China,"Wang Jin’s Dream of China reproduces a traditional Chinese dragon robe in the Qing dynasty court style using the industrial materials PVC and nylon fishing thread. The embroidered waves, clouds, and dragons tint the translucent robe with green hues. Suspended rigidly by an iron chain, with the sleeves outstretched as if supported by invisible limbs, the robe appears hauntingly ethereal. Its weightless presence belies the elaborate production process that typically involves several skilled embroiders.Wang dismantles the imperial prestige and power normally associated with the dragon robe and transforms it into something quaint and elusive. As the title implies, the artist imbues the iconic imagery with new meanings and critiques in response to the consumerism and industrialization that has spread across China since the early 1990s."
Flower_and_Insect,"Chen Zhifo spent six years studying arts and crafts in Japan. After the age of thirty-five, he concentrated on traditional Chinese ""meticulous brush"" paintings like the one shown here. It is confined to a narrow range of delicate colors and retains a Japanese sensitivity to silhouette and the beauty of a particular moment. The inscription reads:There is morning frost on the autumn garden.The yellow flower exudes a delicate fragrance.[Trans. Ellsworth et al, Later Chinese Painting]"
Tiger,"The meticulous rendering of the tiger's fur reveals the persistant influence of the traditional Chinese courtly genre of ""fur-and-feather"" painting and the technical skill required to render details of texture and color."
The_Two_Purities,"With slashing stokes of jet-black ink, Wu Changshuo depicted the “two purities”—pine and plum blossom—as expressive, nearly abstract marks set against the faint gray wash of a garden rock. The ability to withstand the cold of winter imbued both pine and plum with a sense of virtue and steadfastness that was frequently celebrated in premodern Chinese poetry and visual art."
Heavenly_Horse,"All his life, Xu Beihong championed the revitalization of Chinese painting through an integration of Western-style realism and Chinese brush techniques. Here, using sharp tonal contrasts of ink and white paper, Xu's swift rendition of this noble steed embodies the spirit of a traditional ""ink play."" The horse's naturalistic pose is deftly captured in abbreviated brushwork. The chiaroscuro modeling of its form is more subjective than scientific, but the horse's accurate anatomy and the convincing foreshortening of its body reflect Xu's solid grounding in Western academic art. The hauteur of the unleashed, unmounted animal isessentially Western in character, whereas its mane and tail, blowing unnaturally in opposite directions, attests to the artist's ultimately subjective (Chinese) approach.Xu's passionate images of horses, a traditional symbol of Chinese martial spirit, were intended to inspire patriotic resistance during the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45). Here, for example, the artist reveals his own sense of frustration by adding a poem by Du Fu (712–770) that describes a famous breed of war horses that had been put to pasture because of their old age despite their continued willingness to fight:Nanshi [in Gansu province] is a congenial habitat for heavenly horses;Tens of thousands of them are always stalwart.Floating clouds expand across the vast frontier;Autumn grasses grow tall over the mountains.I have heard that the pure bloodline of dragon-horsesLives on in the aging Sushuang horse.Neighing sadly longing to fight,It stands tall facing the sky.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)"
Design_for_a_Hall_Lamp,Design for a hall lamp in the shape of a Chinese palace lantern. The hexagonal body of the lantern is built up out of a red or red painted wooden structure and has brighlty colored painted glass sides with an image of a blossoming branch at the center.
Xiling_Bridge_after_Rain,"This lovely print features the misty scenery of West Lake in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. West Lake, celebrated for its numerous historic and scenic sites, is a traditional subject in Chinese art and literature. Here, its famous willows and lotuses thrive in a subdued but poetic palette of green and gray.Zhao Zongzao, one of China’s most versatile printmakers, has spent most of his career in Zhejiang. His early works often carried political overtones. Beginning in 1959, however, he started creating nonpolitical prints in response to major changes in arts policy; this work is a wonderful example."
Crossing_the_Dadu_River,"This painting depicts the Red Army crossing the Dadu River in Sichuan Province during the Long March (1934–36). Together with the capture of the Luding Bridge, this achievement enabled Mao’s troops to continue their northward retreat toward Yan’an in Shaanxi Province. The political message of struggling against all odds is also applicable to Fu’s effort to find new ways of negotiating Chinese painting under the changed political order. When Eastern Bloc artists saw this and other works by Fu at the First National Chinese Painting Exhibition in 1953, they recommended that his art be published in Europe."
Full_Moon,"Tao was from a family of scholars who trained him in Chinese and Western painting methods. His individual mode of expression combines Eastern and Western techniques, and he exhibited frequently to popular approval in the 1930s and 1940s."
Forts_Zeelandia_and_Provintia_and_the_City_of_Tainan,"This pictorial map depicts the Taiwanese coastal town of Tainan, where the Dutch built two forts around 1624, remnants of which still survive today. In addition to showcasing the European-style forts with their distinctive masonry architecture, the painting records a wealth of other details, including Chinese-style walled towns, farmhouses on stilts, and numerous vignettes of dailym life featuring both people in Chinese dress and half-naked indigenous people.Several versions of this composition—all painted on deerskin—are extant. Although each of the versions is somewhat different, the use of stamps or stencils to reproduce many of the pictorial elements suggests that, like Chinese painted wallpapers, it was created in a workshop for the Western market. While a precise date for the map's creation is difficult to pinpoint, the absence of foreign ships or figures indicates that the composition postdates the departure of the Dutch in 1662, and the presence of a city wall, which was not built until 1791, suggests that the painting, acquired at auction from a German collection in 1909, probably dates to the nineteenth century."
Banquet_No._1,"Li Jin is famed for his raucous images of food and flesh, in which people from all walks of life—and seemingly different times and places—come together in various states of undress over tables laden with treats. A profusion of flowers, meat, fish, and vegetables fills one side of this composition, along with a bottle of Jack Daniel’s whiskey. Most of the male figures are variations of Li’s self-portrait, wearing costumes that range from a pink pig suit to the robe of an ancient Chinese scholar, and expressions that vary from drowsy drunkenness to beatific calm. Li’s whimsical tableaux offer an updated take on the “elegant gathering” for our own time."
Box_with_lid_“Black_and_Red”,"The simple but exquisite box embodies the concept of “hidden beauty.” Its unornamented black exterior conceals a distinctive interior embellished with multicolored xipi lacquer. The box may be seen as a metaphor for the Chinese ideal of seeking inner perfection.Gan’s works reflects an aesthetic attitude shared among a group of contemporary Chinese artists working in different materials. They aim to sustain or revive the highest levels of traditional craftsmanship, by producing distinctive utilitarian objects of great subtlety and beauty."
Snuff_bottle_in_imitation_of_painted_enamel_metalwork,"The eighteenth century witnessed numerous exciting innovations in Chinese ceramics. Artists produced molded or carved porcelain snuff bottles that imitated wares made of other materials, such as lacquer, wood, ivory, and, in this case, painted enamel on metalwork."
Bowl_with_children_in_a_garden,"The theme of boys playing was popular in Chinese decorative arts, as demonstrated by this blue-and-white porcelain bowl. Unlike carving and weaving, brush painting on porcelain gives artists more freedom to represent a variety of children’s facial expressions: delighted, charming, and sometimes mischievous."
Seated_Woman,"Lin Fengmian was one of the first Chinese artists to study in Europe. In 1919 he traveled to France, where he was attracted to the strong colors and semiabstract forms of the Impressionists and the Fauves. When Lin returned to China in 1926, he was appointed principal of the Beijing Art Academy, but his radical views on art alarmed conservatives. He soon left and founded an art academy in Hangzhou that became the locus for study of modern Western art in China before the war.The reorganization of the Hangzhou Academy after the founding of the People's Republic left Lin without a post. He moved to Shanghai and from 1949 to 1977 painted in virtual isolation, stubbornly resisting a Social Realist style. During the Cultural Revolution he was accused of spying and was jailed. In 1977 Lin was granted a leave to visit relatives in Hong Kong; he lived there until his death.Early in his career Lin abandoned oils for Chinese brush and gouache on paper in order to capture a sense of spontaneity—an intention that approached the traditional ideals of the Chinese literati painter. Here, the sweeping gestures of Lin's brushwork and the rhythmic cadences of his lines take precedence over anatomical accuracy."
Melody_of_Dawn,"This poetic work of a lone boat on a misty river transforms traditional Chinese landscape painting into the print medium, and exemplifies the traditional watercolor woodcut technique at its best. Natural wood grain is used to indicate the rough surface of the mountains. Sensitively rendered ink and color gradations create a hazy atmosphere.A native of Kunshan in Jiangsu Province, Lu Fang has participated in international exhibitions in China, the United States, and Tokyo."
Lofty_Branches_Like_Phoenix_Wings,"Because of their association with long life, pine trees were a favored subject for paintings presented on milestone birthdays. Zhang Daqian, one of the most revered modern Chinese painters, made this exceptionally grand example for his friend Zhao Shoujue (1881–1960) on the occasion of the latter’s eightieth birthday. The long inscription recounts the two men’s relationship, which by 1960 had spanned some thirty years."
Landscape,"Hu Yuan's fan is inscribed as follows:The rains cease and the maple forestturns bright in the sunset. On thedeserted mountain a lonely man isrefreshed by the spring run.[Trans. from Ellsworth et al., Later Chinese Painting]"
Vase_with_Dragon_amid_Clouds,"Arguably the most well-known motif in Chinese art, the dragon is a multivalent symbol imbued with many layers of meaning, including protection, happiness, and fertility. In early Chinese art the dragon was understood as a symbol of the cardinal direction east, and it has long been associated with water, particularly lakes and rivers. The dragon also signifies imperial rule, and works decorated with five-clawed dragons are known to have been produced for use at court."
Flourishing_Plum_and_Camellia,Yao Hua was a close friend of Chen Hengke in Peking. He shared Chen's interest in ancient script styles and his belief that an expressive modern idiom lay within the limits imposed by Chinese tradition.
Bodhidharma_crossing_the_Yangzi_River_on_a_reed,"Bodhidharma was the legendary Indian patriarch who brought Chan Buddhism to China. After an unsuccessful audience with the Chinese emperor Liang Wudi (r. 502–49), Bodhidharma “broke off a reed, crossed the Yangzi River, and proceeded to the Shaolin Temple [on Mount Song in Henan Province].”This painting is signed by Li Yaofu, whose name appears only in Japanese records, and is inscribed by Yishan Yining, the renowned Chinese missionary who went in 1299 to Japan. There, Yishan served as abbot of temples in Kamakura and Kyoto until his death. The inscription reads:Crossing rivers and deserts he came.Facing the emperor he confessed, “I don’t know”;Unsuccessful, he moved on,His feet treading the water.While mainstream painters followed the style of Li Gonglin (ca. 1049–1106)—that of baimiao, or “white drawing,” executed with a controlled line of uniform thickness—the Chan painter employed a more flexible brush style that combined fine lines with graduated ink-wash strokes in a free expressive manner. Here, the subtle rendering of the face records the holy man’s foreign features and captures the essence of spiritual concentration."
White_Lilies,"Wang Naizhuang was born in Hangzhou in 1929, and he graduated from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing in 1953. He specialized in Buddhist and floral subjects. This painting of white lilies is typical of his flower style, which uses Chinese pigments and tools to achieve an effect similar to impressionist oil painting."
9616,"Originally an acclaimed painter of broad, splashy landscapes, Li Huasheng pivoted in the 1990s to a rigorous type of abstract ink painting: grids drawn freehand with traditional brushes on absorbent Chinese paper. At first glance, Li’s grids seem impenetrable, a mass of lines woven together like a textile. Viewed at close range, they pulsate with emotion and expressiveness, as every shift in the artist’s energy and concentration is recorded on the page. The modernist visual language of the grid is merged with the idea of brushwork as a window into the artist’s spirit, which Li adopted from premodern Chinese painting. The result is something that both refers to and reaches beyond the landscape tradition."
Rice_measure_with_four_constellation_deities,"This vessel’s shape and pattern identify it as a rare example of a rice measure used in Daoist rituals. On each side is a figure in a Daoist robe with one of four animals (dragon, ox, dog, and goat). These animals represent constellation deities from the set of twenty-eight mansions in Chinese astronomy, which reflect the movement of the moon in a sidereal month."
The_Fire_of_Truth_(Portrait_of_Lu_Xun),"Lu Xun (1881–1936), a leftist writer and critic, was considered by many to be the patriarch of modern Chinese literature. His writings, avidly championed by the Communist regime after 1949, exerted a substantial influence throughout the twentieth century.Lu Xun was also a major force behind the Modern Woodcut Movement in China in the early 1930s, which advocated pictorial prints as the ideal medium to express the need for social and political changes. This print commemorates Lu Xun and his influential publications. The flame imagery symbolizes his revolutionary zeal."
Children_Write_to_the_Army,"This colorful image, in the style of folk-art prints from Yangliuqing, depicts children writing letters to their military heroes, a favored theme expressing the people’s affection for the army. The revolutionary message is integrated with traditional symbols such as the gourds of long life and good fortune.Zhang studied traditional Chinese painting at the Beijing Academy of Fine Arts. During the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45) he taught cartoon making at the Lu Xun Academy of Literature and Art in Yan’an. Purged in 1957 as a rightist and again during the Cultural Revolution, he was rehabilitated in 1978 and later served as President of the Chinese Artists’ Association."
Landscape,"Xie's inscription identifies this as Mount Tonglu, near Hangzhou. The diagonal hatching used to model the mountains recalls a Western drawing technique, but Xie defines his forms using the traditional Chinese method of alternating light and dark passages, with no indication of a consistent light source. Nevertheless,the lamppost in the foreground and telephone poles in the distance signal Xie's determination to record the modern face of China rather than perpetuate traditional landscape conventions."
Reading_by_the_Window_near_a_Pine_Tree,"Feng Zikai developed an abbreviated, almost cartoonish style of painting in response to calls by intellectuals for a twentieth-century Chinese art that could be understood by common people. Here, he renders a classic theme from Chinese landscape painting—a reading scholar in a mountain pavilion—in his new manner, merging conventions of the past with the needs of his own day. The poem reads:The leisurely white clouds come and go often.Don’t mind if I never welcome you in or see you out.Zikai--Translation by Keita Itoh and Lawrence Wu"
Lotus,"Guo Dawei dedicated this painting to Lin Yutang and his wife. It chronicles the life cycle of the lotus. At the center is a flower in full bloom. To the right, two buds have just emerged, while a seed pod dips down between two not yet unfurled leaves. To the left, a pale leaf, tattered and drooping, sets off bare or broken stems. Although Guo painted lotus often, compositions with a distinct temporal dimension like this one are rare.The distinctive pink color of the lotus—namely, ""Western red"" in Chinese—was first imported into China from Mexico in the early twentieth century and became widely used in traditional painting. The sinuous lotus stems cutting across the picture surface are calligraphic lines that create a shallow space through overlapping and contrasting tonality. This work demonstrates Guo's idea that the ""space-consciousness"" in Chinese painting, unlike that in western art, is ""calligraphically created."""
Shi_Le_Seeking_the_Way,"This work depicts an allegorical theme from Chinese history. Shi Le (274–333), portrayed as a general with bow and arrow, approaches the Kuchean Buddhist monk Buttocho (ca. 235–348), both to seek advice about politics and to convert to Buddhism. Contemporary Japanese painting—in particular, Visiting the Hermit by Hashimoto Kansetsu (1883–1945)—inspired Fu’s interpretation of this historical theme."
The_Far_Snows_of_Minshan_Only_Make_Us_Happy,"Fu created this propaganda painting based on a line from Mao Zedong’s poem “The Long March.” Included in the First National Chinese Painting Exhibition, held in Beijing in 1953, it caught the attention of visiting artists from Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the German Democratic Republic, who requested a meeting with Fu after seeing the exhibition."
Ode_to_Yuhuatai,"Yuhuatai, or the Raining Flowers Terrace, in Nanjing was once a Nationalist execution ground where many Communist Party members and soldiers were killed. After liberation it became a park commemorating those martyrs. This revolutionary site in Fu’s home city inspired him to express local interests and experiences, which in turn reinforced the regionalism of Chinese painting in the late 1950s."
Apricot,"The cool, declarative simplicity of this apricot branch, painted as a gift, is complemented by Wu's inscription:I once saw a handscroll by Chen Laolien [Chen Hongshou, 1599–1652], which the painter said was done in the style of a Yuan master, and I have imitated it.[Trans. adapted from Ellsworth et al., Later Chinese Painting]"
The_Culture_Peddler,"The Modern Woodcut Movement is an important but understudied chapter in the history of twentieth-century Chinese art. The movement was initiated by Lu Xun (1881–1936), the father of modern Chinese literature and an incisive cultural critic, who saw woodcut as the ideal medium for rousing what he saw as a complacent China from its slumber to face up to the challenges of the modern world. Easily produced from inexpensive materials and with relatively limited training, woodcut was seen as a counterpoint to the precious erudition of literati landscape painting. The medium was used extensively during the 1930s and ‘40s—by both Communist and Nationalist leaders—to disseminate political messages in a graphically impactful, legible form. Some of the most iconic vignettes from the War of Resistance (against Japan, 1937–45) and the Chinese Civil War (1945–49) were produced in this medium. The current set of prints were produced in the Communist milieu—at Yan’an, the mountain stronghold in northern Shaanxi Province that served as the capital of the Communist government during the 1940s."
Song_of_the_Lute,"Based on a poem by Bai Juyi (772–846), this painting captures the moment when the exiled poet and his friend meet a pipa (Chinese lute) player whose music evokes the sorrow of banishment. Painted during the war, when Fu was also forced to live far from the capital, the painting reflects his interest in representing emotions. But Fu was also indebted to a work depicting the same subject by the Japanese artist Hashimoto Kansetsu (1883–1945)."
Windblown_bamboo,"Backed by a waterfall and a cliff, stalks of bamboo shake in a violent wind. This powerful image was painted by Yang Han, an obscure artist from Shandong Province who was active during the early Qing dynasty. Images of windswept bamboo were often associated with “loyalist” (yimin) painters—those who refused to serve the non-Chinese rulers of the newly established Qing dynasty. In bamboo, whose flexibility allowed it to bend without breaking, loyalists saw a powerful symbol of quiet resistance."
Ducks_and_Peach_Blossoms,"Persecuted and imprisoned for his bourgeois individualism during the Cultural Revolution, Shi Lu escaped death only after being diagnosed as a schizophrenic. During this period he turned increasingly to the practice of calligraphy and calligraphic painting. In this work, dating to the early 1970s, the fragmented image of three swimming ducks matches the tremulous quality of Shi Lu's inscription:How ducks make merry with peach blossoms in spring water.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 244)"
Hermit_Playing_the_Qin,"The year 1919 was an important one in the political fate of the new Chinese Republic. The Treaty of Versailles ending World War I transferred all former German possessions in China to Japan, rather than satisfy Chinese demands for sovereignty and the nullification of foreign privileges in China. On May 4, 1919, students led protest riots in Peking against this blow to Chinese national pride. By June, the focus of protest had moved to Shanghai, where Wang Zhen lived. The May Fourth Movement led to a democratization of Chinese culture, particularly in the use of the vernacular language in literature. New ideas, including socialism, communism, anarchism, pragmatism and women's liberation flashed among the urban populations.In this climate of political and cultural change, Wang Zhen's painting of the spring of 1920 is particularly poignant. It is a painting of reclusion. The robe-clad figure faces away, lost in contemplation of mists and a ""waterfall that splashes like pearls."" The image of a paradise, whether a Buddhist Pure Land or the Peach Blossom Spring of China's literary history, appears in several paintings on view in this exhibition. Wang Zhen's own Buddhist beliefs led him to raise money for victims of a major earthquake in Japan at a time when anti-Japanese sentiment in China ran high."
Ruled-painting,"The use of a straightedge for architectural paintings, particularly fashionable during the Song dynasty (960–1279) when realism enjoyed a vogue, is updated by Feng Zikai in this simple depiction of the courtyard of a traditional Chinese compound. His witty marriage of traditional architectural drawing to Western perspectival techniques is typically unprepossessing."
Quatrain_on_a_Spring_Garden,"This verse, written during Lizong's maturity in a charming cursive script for the ""noble consort"" who inspired it, makes clear that life was not without its pleasures for the aging emperor:Last year I saw a branch scented with a red fragrance;Faintly, I imagined red corollas with little makeup.Today, in the palace garden, such colors abound.Perhaps, without knowing it, I prayed to the god of spring.(Wen C. Fong, trans., in Beyond Representation: Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 8th–14th Century [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art,1992], p. 242)"
Sunrise_over_South_Lake,"Shi Handing’s prints often combine traditional landscapes with revolutionary iconography. By enriching transparent colors on traditional rice paper, he creates novel visual effects.This work commemorates the first Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921, which, after being intervened in Shanghai, moved to a boat on South Lake in Jiaxing, in northern Zhejiang Province. Red, the color of the boat and the rising sun, was emblematic of the Communist revolution and particularly associated with Chairman Mao during the Cultural Revolution."
Lychees_and_Insects,"Contemporary Chinese artists have perpetuated fine brush as well as broad brush techniques. Lu Yifei attributes the style of this fan to the 18th century Yangzhou eccentric Hua Yen, but the perspective imposed by his renderings of the insects places the painting clearly in the 20th century."
Page_from_the_Ten_Bamboo_Studio_Manual_of_Painting_and_Calligraphy,"The Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy is one of the earliest and finest examples of color printing from China. The book, which served as both luxury object and guide for the aspiring painter, compiles familiar images from Chinese art, especially flowers, rocks, birds, and bamboo."
Design_for_a_Hall_Lamp,"Design for a hall lamp in the shape of a Chinese palace lantern. The lantern consists of two parts, attached by thin cords. The top part is shaped like a hexagonal baldachin with tassels hanging down from the six protruding tips. The body of the lantern also has a hexagonal shape, with painted glass sides which taper towards the bottom."
Cottage_by_the_River,"Li Keran belongs to the first generation of artists able to learn both Western and traditional Chinese techniques in art schools in China. The new academies introduced significant changes in the training of new artists. There were systematic curricula and calligraphy was detached from its traditional role as the discipline and underlying painting. Li Keran, unlike many contemporary artists is a calligrapher as well as a painter, and his study of Six Dynasties stone inscriptions gives his brush strokes a vigor that distinguishes his style.In this painting, Li's interest in drawing real landscapes if confirmed. He experimented with Chinese forms of Western pictorial conventions. Wash is used to render reflections in water, while reserve white conveys light and air in the foreground trees."
Mount_Qingcheng,"For more than two millennia, the Chinese intellectual tradition has celebrated the act of reclusion, especially in moments of political turmoil. This is the path Shanghai-born artist Lu Yanshao chose in 1942, when he traveled from Chongqing, the wartime capital of the Republican government of China, to Mount Qingcheng, a center of Daoist practice further inland. Lu’s poem, which he inscribed at the top of the painting, describes the serenity and restorative power of Qingcheng; left unspoken are the horrors of war from which Lu sought respite."
Brewing_Tea,"Wu Changshuo created a distinctive style that fused the classical epigraphic approach to painting with the popular style of Ren Yi (1840–1895) and continued the literati ideal of uniting poetry, calligraphy, and painting in a single work of art.Wu's image of a scholar seated beside a qin (zither) savoring freshly brewed tea celebrates the timeless literati ideals of refinement, withdrawal, and self-cultivation. Wu chose a traditional subject and blunt calligraphic brushwork when many artists were turning to the West for subject matter and style, reflecting his belief in the Chinese tradition as an enduring resource for the modern artist. Wu's poem reads:Watching the bubbling spring water,Sitting beside the stony edge of the lake,Old pines resemble ancient sages,A qin lies by a man from the past.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 71)"
Vase,"Lush pinkish-red glazes, such as the “peach bloom” on this small vase, were first produced in the third quarter of the seventeenth century. Small vases in this shape have long been thought to belong to sets of eight or more accoutrements designed for a writing table. This is one of four vases, each with a subtly different shape, that were found among a set of implements. It is distinguished from the others by the three thin rings at the base of the neck. These sets, which may or may not actually have been used, were most likely intended for presentation as gifts to officials working at the court. As is often the case with works produced for the court, a six-character inscription on the base indicates that it was made during the reign of the Kangxi emperor (Da Qing Kangxi nian zhi). The style of writing of the Chinese characters, however, helps date the piece to the period from 1678 to 1688"
Remote_Temple_on_the_Autumn_Mountain,"This painting dates from the period when Chen Hengke was preparing his influential treatise on the history of literati painting, drawing upon the same Japanese scholarship that, translated into English, became an important basis for the study of Chinese painting in the West."
Pine_tree_and_rock,"Tang Di, a native of Wujin (Jiangsu province), was the great-grandson of the renowned scholar-painter Tang Yifen (1778–1853). Though accomplished in painting, calligraphy, and poetry, he prided himself most on his knowledge of physiognomy. In Beijing, where he lived for many years, he was active as a teacher as well as an artist. This work dates to that period of his life.The painting features a powerfully posturing pine. A moss-covered rock, leaning to the left, offers a counter-thrust to the rightward leaning tree. In Chinese culture, the pine is revered as the gentleman of trees. It remains green regardless of climatic variations. Constant and lofty, it differs from all other beings around it, yet lives in harmony with them."
Bowl_“Deer-Antler_Sand”,"The bowl “Deer-Antler Sand” features a fine-grained surface created from multicolored lacquer and gold foil. This special lacquer technique is based on a traditional finish that used ground deer-antler. Gan’s bowl achieves the appearance of this technique using only lacquer and gold.Gan’s works reflects an aesthetic attitude shared among a group of contemporary Chinese artists working in different materials. They aim to sustain or revive the highest levels of traditional craftsmanship, by producing distinctive utilitarian objects of great subtlety and beauty."
Gazing_at_a_Waterfall,"The scholar in this fan painting, apparently lost in the pleasures of watching a waterfall in the comfort of a thatched pavilion built expressly for this purpose, must represent the dream of every Chinese scholar-artist. A superb calligrapher, Tang Yin is able to impart extraordinary expressiveness to his rock and tree forms, which are done in the Southern Song ink-wash idiom, normally considered the style of the ""professional"" painters of his time."
On_Man_and_Nature,"Lin Yutang wrote this piece for his son-in-law Li Ming (Richard Lai). It begins with a transcription of a passage from the essay ""On Nature"" by Xunzi (Xun Qing, 340–245 B.C.), one of the twin pillars of early Confucianism. After the quotation, Lin offers his own comment on Xunzi's idea. In his essay, Xunzi took pains to refute the rival theory of the ""unity of man and nature"" that was to dominate Chinese thought for the next two millennia. Lin Yutang notes that this is the only place in the history of Chinese philosophy where the notion of mankind overcoming nature for its own benefit is so strongly articulated. He also sees in Xunzi's words a parallel to the Western scientific and utilitarian approach to nature, and, for once in his life, champions the Western attitude toward nature as a material resource to be exploited. instead of regarding Nature as great and admiring it, why not foster it as a thing and regulate it? Instead of obeying Nature and singing its praise, why not control the Mandate of Nature and use it? Instead of watching the seasons and waiting for them, why not respond to them and make use of them? Instead of letting things multiply by themselves, why not exercise your abilityto transform [and increase] them?(trans. by Wing-tsit Chan, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1963], p. 122)"
Vase_“Tang_Flow”,"The vase is inspired by the form of some Tang dynasty (618–907) ceramics and bronzes—hence its name, “Tang Flow.” The lacquer surface not only mimics the flowing effect of ceramic glaze, but also subtly reflects the mottled appearance of bronze patina. This effect is the artist’s own invention.Gan’s works reflects an aesthetic attitude shared among a group of contemporary Chinese artists working in different materials. They aim to sustain or revive the highest levels of traditional craftsmanship, by producing distinctive utilitarian objects of great subtlety and beauty."
Returning_to_Nature_through_a_Reclusive_Life,"Yu Peng belongs to the first generation of artists born in Taiwan after the Nationalist government reestablished itself on the island in 1949, and his art, like that of many of his contemporaries, often addresses the politically fraught issue of cultural identity in Taiwan. Yu lives in Taipei but has asserted his mainland Chinese heritage by naming his residence the Pingyang Studio, after his ancestral hometown in Hebei Province. In exploring the legacy of his historic homeland, he has constructed his own interpretation of a ""literati"" way of life. Adopting an approach that is both whimsical and satirical, Yu selectively evokes the ways of the ancients while simultaneously acknowledging the blend of nostalgia and modern, middle-class taste prevalent in metropolitan Taipei after its rapid economic growth during the 1980s and 1990s.Employing a traditional medium and format, Yu divided his composition roughly into thirds. The central section is dominated by a red ground, where a figure dressed to resemble a scholargentleman is seated. He is surrounded by ten mannequin-like figures and backed by a painted screen—elements that may allude to the artist's interest in shadow puppet theater. The crowded lower third of the painting presents a fantastical garden bustling with curious figures and objects associated with Chinese antiquity. The landscape in the top third of the composition similarly references traditional styles."
Bowl_“Red_Gold”,"Gan Erke, a leading master from Huizhou (Anhui province), a traditional center for producing literati objects including lacquerware. Among Gan’s varied creations, the most notable is his “rhinoceros hide” (xipi) marbled lacquer, a technique used on the bowl “Red Gold” and the box “Black and Red” (2021.5a, b).Gan’s works reflects an aesthetic attitude shared among a group of contemporary Chinese artists working in different materials. They aim to sustain or revive the highest levels of traditional craftsmanship, by producing distinctive utilitarian objects of great subtlety and beauty."
Poem_Written_in_the_Style_of_the_Haotaiwang_Stele,"Feng Kanghou, a native of Guangdong Province, was an outstanding seal-carver and calligrapher. In this work, dedicated to Li Ming (Richard Lai), he composed a quatrain with characters collected from an ancient stele commemorating Kwanggaet'o-daewang (r. 391–412)—Haotaiwang in Chinese—the nineteenth king of the Koguryo state that occupied the northern portion of the Korean peninsula and parts of Manchuria from 37 B.C. to A.D. 668. This monument was erected near the Koguryo capital of Kungnaesong (in present-day Ji'an, Jilin province) in 414. After this area fell under Chinese rule in 668, the stele sank into oblivion. Its accidental rediscovery in 1877 marked a major find in the avid search for ancient steles in nineteenth- and early-twentieth- century China. As Feng notes here, ""The calligraphy of the Haotaiwang Stele, while simple and unpolished, emanates antique exuberance. However bold and free, it retains the discipline of clerical script."" Following convention, Feng Kanghou transcribed his poem by faithfully duplicating the forms of carved characters. However, his transcription shows its own idiosyncratic features. Feng sought to evoke the archaic flair of his model by intentionally simulating the damage or wear to the stele as well as the crude craftsmanship of its carver by making some of his lines crooked or uneven. Feng's poem reads:My home in a stretch of hills by the distant waterIs said to be the place of eternal joy and peace.What people have loved from ancient times to the present is all here.Mountains and lakes are such delights.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)"
The_True_Story_of_Ah_Q,"The True Story of Ah Q by the revolutionary writer Lu Xun (1881–1936) is bitterly ironic. The fictional Ah Q lived through the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 and the early years of the Republic. Paradoxically a bully and a coward, he epitomizes the seriously flawed Chinese character. Mindlessly following others through a life of misery, defiance, and self-delusion, he eventually brings about his own execution.Zhao Yannian’s series of sixty woodblock-printed illustrations of this story is considered his masterpiece. Redolent of European Expressionism, Zhao’s prints focus attention on Lu Xun’s antihero by creating strong contrasts with the “black against white” and “white against black” techniques."
Quatrain_on_Late_Spring,"A Song palace seal impressed on the left-hand side of this writing reads: ""Treasure of imperial writing.""In his poem, the emperor laments the coming of old age:How spring makes me sad!Timidly I bear the passing of spring.The young lady has no feeling for me,She treats my love merely as that of a waning spring.(Wen C. Fong, trans., in Beyond Representation: Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 8th-14th Century [New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1992], p. 242.)"
Camellia_and_Butterflies,"Guo Weiqu learned both Chinese and Western painting in his youth. Although his later work in Chinese media barely reveals any Western influences, his training in Western art was crucial in liberating him from the restraints of traditional art practice and contributed to his innovative approach of blending different genres and contrasting styles. Reaching artistic maturity in the late 1950s, Guo's upbeat eclecticism conveys the optimistic, progressive ethos of the New China under Communist leadership.Guo considered composition the key to a successful work, and the most important compositional concern in flower-and-bird painting, in his opinion, was to build momentum. He shunned calligraphic brushstrokes in favor of series of short, rhythmic lines to shape forms.Far from precise or concrete, the contours of his subjects tend to blur, evoking motion and change.Like many artists of his generation, Guo Weiqu sought to serve the national cause through his art. Even after the persecution he suffered during the Cultural Revolution severely crippled his health, he remained true to Communist ideology. The frequent reference to the morning sun in his inscriptions, therefore, may carry a political meaning, since it was a common symbol of Communist China and Chairman Mao. The inscription reads:The morning sun enters my window, rising among trees fresh and moist.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)"
The_Pavilion_of_Prince_Teng,"The Pavilion of Prince Teng demonstrates that Tang Di, a scholar and government official best known for his large-scale colored paintings on silk, was also capable of producing intimate, more informal ink drawings on paper. As he does in his monumental decorative style, Tang here follows the conservative brush idiom of the Northern Song master Guo Xi (ca. 1000–ca. 1090), though his relaxed calligraphic depiction of rocks, trees, and foliage reflects the early Yuan transformation of Song models by Tang Di's teacher, Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322). The pavilion, erected in the seventh century by the prince of Teng, is one of the most renowned buildings in Chinese history, thanks to the poet Wang Bo (649–676). It is situated near the confluence of the Gan and Yangzi Rivers in Jiangsi Province. Wang's poem, which contrasts the impermanence of human life with the endless flow of the river, has made the pavilion a favorite subject for painters. The large seals at the beginning of this scroll belong to Prince Yi (1686–1730), thirteenth son of the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662–1722)."
Shrimp,"Qi Baishi's early mentor in Beijing, Chen Hengke (1876–1923), counseled him to abandon his technical training and strive for a new expressive freedom through a calligraphic approach to painting. The subsequent transformation of Qi's style is illustrated by this painting. Each crustacean—like a single Chinese character—is formed through the repetition of the same conventionalized pattern of marks. Released from the need to visualize each shrimp separately, Qi thus was free to explore the abstract expressive possibilities of structure, ink tone, and composition and to achieve the direct, childlike spontaneity and naturalness that are hallmarks of his work. Qi's exhilaration at the possibilities offered by this method are reflected in his inscription:If you can forget painting theory, you will not suffer from its deeply rooted bad effects. Then your brush will fly like the heavenly horse moving through the sky.(Robert H. Ellsworth et al., trans., Later Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 1800-1950, 3 vols. [New York: Random House, 1987], vol. 1, p. 157)"
Awaiting_the_Emperor's_Return_from_the_Southern_Suburbs,"From 1523 to 1527 Wen Zhengming served as an official in the capital, where his talents—as well as his patience—were put to the test by a flood of requests for literary compositions and calligraphy. This poem, written in celebration of the Jiaqing emperor's (r. 1522–66) return journey to his palace, is lavish in praise and formal in tone; the calligraphy is in the grand manner of Yan Zhenqing (709–785) and Huang Tingjian (1045–1105):The bell on the Imperial Lord's returning chariotcalms the singingof myriad larks;Purplish clouds, gathering above, shelter thepowerful essence.Chariots and armor glitter like brilliantconstellations.On banners preceding the emperor's chariot, sunand moon shine brightly.For ten miles the spring wind heralds theapproach of the imperial procession.All quarters are in harmony with the music ofsage emperors.In my old age I have the chance to view personallythe glory of this imperial procession;And wish to take the ""Ssu wen"" ode [in the Bookof Poetry] as my example in praise of thispeaceful reign.(Shih Shou-chien, trans., in ""Calligraphy as Gift: Wen Cheng-ming's (1470–1559) Calligraphy and the Formation of the Soochow Literati Culture,"" in Cary Y. Liu et al., eds., Character and Context in Chinese Calligraphy [Princeton: The Art Museum, Princeton University, 1999], p. 258)"
Flying_Magpie,"This painting captures a magpie in midflight; its spreading wings and half-extended feet suggest that it has just taken off or is about to land. The delicate whips of a willow form a minimal backdrop. Their arcing lines imply a breeze behind the bird's forward motion. Although the austere simplicity of this composition is characteristic of the literati tradition of Chinese painting, the rendering of the magpie's plumage is free of the calligraphic brush idioms of traditional scholar-painters. Rather, the bird's naturalism betrays Xu's mastery of Western representational skills."
Monk_Gazing_at_Clouds,"Here, Su Renshan exploited the linear patterns and graphic forms found in woodblock prints—one of his principal sources of inspiration—to create a startlingly minimalist style. His economical drawing, more sketch than painting, conveys the artist's hand with great immediacy, but Su shows little interest in describing the mass and surface textures of his forms. Furthermore, individual motifs remain isolated, their interrelationships ambiguous. Like an opaque mist that reveals only disconnected glimpses of scenery, Su's landscape presents a composition that is fragmentary and disorienting. The artist's disregard for perspective or representational detail is underscored by his inscription, which makes clear that Su considered painting a conscious act of creation rather than an imitation of nature:Where my brush reaches the broken cliff with a rushing waterfall,I add a figure of a monk by the rock, gazing at the clouds.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 79)"
Yan'an,"Yan’an, the wartime base of the Chinese Communist Party, is here depicted with a sensitivity to both atmospheric and coloristic effects. The red-tinged Yan’an Pagoda Hill stands prominently against the sky. The gradation of ink and color tones—from deep black to pale gray to red ocher—heightens the effects of light, time, and distance. Yet, there is a deliberate attempt to convey the redness of Communism, which suggests Fu’s renewed political consciousness in response to the changing political climate."
Spring_Festival_along_the_River,"Hong juxtaposes a series of photographs documenting a journey from suburban Beijing into the city center with scenes from a similar journey imagined in the most famous cityscape from imperial China—a twelfth-century handscroll thought to depict the Song dynasty capital at Kaifeng. Beginning with a snapshot of the Great Wall taken from an expressway outside Beijing, the side-by-side presentation invites the viewer to compare the technology of the brush with that of the camera, ink painting with color photography, and scenes of the ancient past with vignettes from contemporary life. By presenting contemporary images alongside a celebrated example of ancient Chinese art, Hong examines attitudes toward progress and nostalgia, but whether he is championing one over the other remains ambiguous."
Weeping_Willow,"This painting, executed shortly after the Japanese occupied Beijing in 1937, makes a point about life under foreign occupation, as Qi makes clear in his inscription:Do not criticize Dao [Yuanming's] family for being weak, for lacking courage. There are times that willow branches must learn to bend [with the wind].(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 163)"
"Select_Characters_from_Huaisu's_""Autobiography""","In 1969 Xie began to study the calligraphy of Huaisu (725–ca. 799), whose Autobiography is the most celebrated example of wild cursive script in Chinese art. Xie wrote an essay on the master in 1970; this calligraphy therefore can be dated tentatively to that period.In these two album leaves, rather than copy the entire text, Xie excerpted individual characters that interested him. In the photograph of the original text (displayed above), the three characters outlined in red were the models for the last three characters in the first column (on the far right) of Xie's copy."
"Thousand-Armed,_Thousand-Eyed_Guanyin","At the middle of a teeming universe of divine beings sits the most elaborate form of Guanyin, whose eleven heads and thousand hands—each with an eye in the palm—signify the universal nature of the deity’s compassion. This painting was made for use in a multiday ritual centered on Guanyin. Like many Chinese Buddhist rituals, this one called on the power of non-Buddhist figures as well, such as the Thunder God and the Mother of Lightning, who are among Guanyin’s retinue. The dated artist’s signature (along the lower right edge) and the painted border, which imitates a fancy brocaded silk mount, are rare if not unique among surviving paintings of this type."
Free_copy_of_Xu_Jiaozhi’s_calligraphy,"明 王鐸 臨徐嶠之帖 軸 絹本Wang Duo was a great student of calligraphy, but he did not honor the past by slavishly imitating it. The text comes from a Tang dynasty (618—907) piece of calligraphy but the writing style is pure late Ming, when the rough and bold were appreciated as much—or more than—the smooth and elegant. The middle line of the scroll demonstrates Wang's love of strong contrasts and audacious visual effects: it begins with heavy lines of dark, wet ink, thins to dry gossamer lines by the middle, then returns to heavy lines at the end. Wang even let the ink pool and seep into the satin in places, which created unpredictable patterns. This work demonstrates the enduring social function of calligraphy in Chinese society: the eighth century piece that Wang Duo copied was a letter sent between friends, and this large hanging scroll was given as a gift, possibly to solidify an important relationship."
"Voting_with_Beans,_Choosing_a_Good_Candidate","The Modern Woodcut Movement is an important but understudied chapter in the history of twentieth-century Chinese art. The movement was initiated by Lu Xun (1881–1936), the father of modern Chinese literature and an incisive cultural critic, who saw woodcut as the ideal medium for rousing what he saw as a complacent China from its slumber to face up to the challenges of the modern world. Easily produced from inexpensive materials and with relatively limited training, woodcut was seen as a counterpoint to the precious erudition of literati landscape painting. The medium was used extensively during the 1930s and ‘40s—by both Communist and Nationalist leaders—to disseminate political messages in a graphically impactful, legible form. Some of the most iconic vignettes from the War of Resistance (against Japan, 1937–45) and the Chinese Civil War (1945–49) were produced in this medium. The current set of prints were produced in the Communist milieu—at Yan’an, the mountain stronghold in northern Shaanxi Province that served as the capital of the Communist government during the 1940s."
Cormorants,"The balanced composition, shimmering palette, and lyrical rhythms of the birds' silhouettes in this work, dated two years after the end of the Cultural Revolution, convey contentment. Li Kuchan could once again celebrate the simple pleasures of life in his art, as his inscription suggests:When I lived in Jiangnan, I kept some cormorants and I would watch them from morning to night chasing about the waves to catch fish in endlessly variable and indescribable ways. It was most enjoyable.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 229)"
Grazing_Horse,"Xu Beihong was the most influential proponent of Western academic realism in twentieth-century China. Inspired by the political reformer Kang Youwei (1858–1927), who advocated ""an integration of Chinese and Western art to create a new era of Chinese painting,"" Xu traveled to Japan in 1917 to study Western art and returned the following year to become an art instructor at Beijing University. In 1919 Xu became the first government-sponsored student to go to Europe to study art. Until 1927 he studied in Paris and Berlin, mastering an already moribund academic style.This painting exemplifies Xu's fusion of East and West. While he employed the conventional Chinese medium of brush and ink, his drawing technique was purely Western. Rather than defining the horse with calligraphically energized outlines, he sketched it impressionistically, integrating light and dark washes and uninked areas of paper to suggest light and shadow. The horse's complex pose-foreshortened body, twisting neck, and naturalistically placed legs is deftly rendered with a few well-practiced brushstrokes, while the layered tones of the animal's tail give the impression of movement.Recalling the tradition of the horse as an emblem of state, Xu's spirited animals appeal to national pride. He painted so many of them that they have become synonymous with his name. Xu made this early example for Qi Baishi's son when going to visit Qi's house. Qi explains in his inscription that Xu failed to bring his seals, which is why the painting lacks an impression."

Copy_of_Dong_Qichang’s_Wanluan_Thatched_Cottage,"This painting is a copy of one of the most celebrated depictions of a rustic retreat in Chinese history: Dong Qichang’s Wanluan Thatched Cottage of 1597. Dong painted his strange, off-kilter composition to commemorate his friend Chen Jiru’s newly completed mountain villa. More than two centuries later, Qian Du lovingly copied every aspect of the painting, including three inscriptions by the artist and the many inscriptions by the Qianlong emperor that cover the painting’s surface. Qian followed the original in all respects but one: the long, pliant needles of the pine trees in the foreground are rendered in Qian’s distinctive manner."
Climbing_the_Eastern_Marchmount,"鄧石如 行書 登東嶽詩 八條屏 紙本Deng Shiru, a committed student of ancient calligraphy who traveled the length of China in search of inspiration, was one of the pioneer figures of the Epigraphic School. He wrote this work in commemoration of a trip to the summit of Mt. Tai, the most sacred mountain in traditional Chinese cosmology and a site of many early stone inscriptions. Deng is said to have used a long, flexible brush made of goat hair, which he could easily twist and drag to create the long, vertical strokes that you see throughout this work. Deng’s trembling lines are likely an homage to the ancient inscriptions he saw on Mt. Tai."
Snow_Over_an_Expanse_of_Forests,"Mount Changbai (“Eternally White”) stretches hundreds of miles along the Chinese border with Korea. When Fu Baoshi ascended its summit on a sketch trip in the summer of 1961, he proclaimed it the most extraordinary and magnificent site he had ever visited. In the inscription, he states that he had depicted the mountain’s spectacular scenery several times, but none captured its majestic grandeur in full. Rendered in dramatically contrasting light and dark, this landscape of expansive wilderness flecked with snow is considered closest to embodying his artistic vision of the place."
Fleet_Race_on_Romanian_Navy_Day,"After visiting Czechoslovakia, Fu Baoshi and the other members of the Chinese artists’ delegation visited Romania, where they witnessed the celebration of Navy Day at the port city of Constanta. Fu’s sketch is accompanied by this inscription: “On August 4, we arrived at Constanta. Seeing festive banners and flags all over the city, we learned that it was Navy Day. At 11:00 a.m., fireworks announced the start of the fleet race. We waited until the ships got closer. Swift as the wind and quick as lighting, they drew a white curve on the Black Sea. How spectacular!”"
Various_Subjects,"Between 1923 and 1925 Li Kuchan attended the National Art Academy in Beijing, where he studied Western painting under Xu Beihong (1895–1953) and Chinese painting under Qi Baishi (1864–1957). From 1930 to 1934 Li taught at the Hangzhou Art Academy as a colleague of Pan Tianshou (1897–1971). He then returned to Beijing and became a professor of painting at the Central Academy. This work, created at the height of the Cultural Revolution, graphically conveys Li's determination to preserve his dignity in the face of persecution. While his accompanying comments seem humorous, they cannot disguise the spirit of proud defiance embodied by the symbols of endurance and survival he has chosen to depict."
Listening_to_the_Waterfall_in_a_Valley_of_Pines,"The compactness of composition and the restless energy of this powerful work suggest inspiration from the late Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) master, Wang Meng (ca. 1308–1385). What gives it a modernist edge is, above all, the daring pointillist technique employed to characterize the rugged bluff to the left of the waterfall. Unlike anything in traditional Chinese painting, these rock formations are shaped solely by clusters of wet dots of varying tonalities. They recall the Impressionist feat of capturing light’s movements. Fu’s arbitrary application of the dots, however, reveals his Expressionist instincts."
Two_Nuns,"Many artists who studied in European academies in the 1920s and 1930s sought a knowledge of anatomy, perspective and chiaroscuro—techniques peripheral to Chinese art training. Some of these students for instance, Xu Beihong, came away from Europe with academic styles of painting as well as academic techniques.Lin Fengmian, who went to Paris in 1922, found academic realism lacking in expressiveness and gravitated to the Impressionists and the Fauves, with their strong colors and semi-abstract forms. He exhibited in the first show of Chinese art students in France in 1924. Four years later, he assumed directorship of the National Academy of Art and made Hangzhou the locus for study of modern Western art in China before the war. In 1937 he took students with him to the wartime capital of Zhongging.Lin's indebtedness to Matisse is clear in Two Nuns, but his reasons for finding Matisse so compelling lie in his training in the principles of Chinese art: economy of line, decorative value of pattern and use of empty space as form.Lin, married to a French woman, was accused during the Cultural Revolution of spying against China and was jailed. After the Cultural Revolution he left China for Hong Kong."
Nymph_of_the_Luo,"This painting depicts the Nymph of the Luo River, a mythical river goddess who was celebrated in a famous prose-poem by the poet and prince Cao Zhi (192–232 CE.) Cao’s influential early poem established the Nymph as a subject of erotic preoccupation in the Chinese literary imagination, a position further solidified by a seminal early painting of the subject by the pioneering painter Gu Kaizhi (c. 344–406). Celebrations of the Nymph of the Luo River and the famous poem and painting that immortalized her subsequently became common in Chinese culture. The painter Yu Ming’s friend and frequent collaborator Xu Zonghao 徐宗浩 (1880–1957), transcribed Cao’s lengthy poem in the upper register of the hanging scroll.Yu Ming was born in Wuxing and spent much of his career in Shanghai and Beijing. Though largely aligned with traditionalist groups that advocated the continued development of traditions of classical Chinese painting, Yu was also trained in European watercolor techniques.: According to Xu Zonghao’s inscription, this painting is a copy of an original image of the Nymph of the Luo River by the great Yuan dynasty painter Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322), and as such it reflects the interest in classical Chinese paintings that animated many of Yu’s patrons in Beijing and Shanghai."
Five_crabs,"Crabs became an important subject in Qi Baishi's painting after he moved into a new studio in 1913 and crabs frequented his backyard. He once observed, ""When a crab moves, its legs rise and fall in strict order despite their great number. This is something crab painters in the world do not know."" This work represents his mature style, when naturalism and abstraction found a new balance. The subtle gradation of the ink suggests the undulation of the shell's surface. The eyes have become two short slanting lines. The claws, as circular splotches of ink with two simple converging lines, are reduced to geometric abstraction. During the last forty years of his life Qi lived in Beijing and befriended people of radically different persuasions. His passive tolerance of things of which he might not approve shows in his sarcastic inscription to this painting, which reads: ""I just fold my arms and watch you gentlemen go."" The Chinese term for the sideways movement of crabs, hengxing, is also a metaphor for impudent behavior. Qi often humorously compared crabs to presumptuous people. Here, he states that he will simply stand aside and let these creatures have their way."
"Plum,_Bamboo,_and_Rock","This painting testifies to Xu Beihong's aspiration to revitalize Chinese painting with a new experimental eclecticism. The bamboo is meticulously outlined, then filled with colored wash in the refined, descriptive style of Song dynasty (960–1279) court painting, which Xu admired. But a roughly outlined ochre rock is virtually flat, while the patches of ink wash that texture the adjacent lower tree trunk arbitrarily extend beyond its contours. Such perfunctory modes of execution were often criticized by Xu as mannerisms afflicting the literati painting tradition. But in this case, Xu's incongruous mix of brush methods enhances the painting's appeal by shattering conventional expectations. The plum blossoms, rendered as daubs of white pigment with blue cores, represent an audacious departure from their traditional rendering in either ink outlines or pale color washes. The blue, surprising at first glance, realistically renders the shadows of intensely white objects; aesthetically it echoes the blue-green bamboo. The white blossoms, indistinct against the blank paper, faithfully capture the optical impression of white plum blossoms in a bleak wintry landscape. The inscribed poem reads:With its shadow it rests in the empty mountain;How swiftly the year has moved toward an end!The bright moon is chilly throughout the night;The subtle fragrance lingers in the vastness.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)"
Ancient_Warrior,"Gao Jianfu was an early advocate of reforming the arts through the study of Western-style painting. In 1906 he went to Japan, where he studied a new form of ""Japanese-style"" painting that synthesized Western realism—natural light and luminous colors—with Eastern materials, techniques, and subject matter. This new hybrid art included the use of perspective, chiaroscuro, and other elements of Western painting.Gao's willingness to experiment with exotic subject matter and non-Chinese techniques is epitomized in Ancient Warrior, painted in Calcutta. The large-eyed, mustachioed figure was inspired by the new nationalistic painting style of the Bengali artist Abanindranath Tagore (1871–1931)."
Flower_and_Rock,"Xie Gongzhan's inscription informs us that his painting was done in the high spirits that followed a visit to the elegant Ming gardens of the neighboring Suzhou. His poem and the ecstatic flourish of his brush style are in full harmony:Blooming in profusion, they recall bouquets and piled brocades.I am rapt and full of praise.These elaborate ornaments from the Emperor of SpringAdorn my soundless poem.[Trans. adapted from Ellsworth, et al., Later Chinese Painting]"
A_Beauty_at_the_Window_by_a_Plum_Tree,"A poem by Yu Ming's uncle, the poet Yu Yuan inspired this wistful, delicate painting:Light frost nibbles the hibiscus bit by bit.How many times has autumn come to thesilvered room screen?There is an oath-mark on her jade arm andtraces of scent below her neck.The center of the banana tree harbors asmany layers as a melancholy heart.[Trans. adapted from Ellsworth et al., Later Chinese Painting]"
Wine_Jar_and_Melon,"Born into a family of artists in Beijing, Guo Dawei studied painting under Qi Baishi (1864–1957) for three years in his youth, and their bond lasted a lifetime. Since Guo painted in the same abbreviated, expressive style as his mentor, his works are often mistaken for Qi's.Guo Dawei painted this scroll for Lin Yutang's daughter Taiyi and her husband Li Ming (Richard Lai) in the winter of 1959 when they were all visiting London. It demonstrates the visual impact of Guo's vigorous brushwork and bold use of color. He emphasized the qualities of weightiness and enormity in art, which this painting embodies with its sense of mass and architectonic structure.Although Guo Dawei came to the United States to study Western art in 1954, through the 1980s he remained committed to maintaining the purity of Chinese traditions. The abstract forms and the unnatural color of the melon in this painting, however, suggest that he was keenly aware of trends in Western modernist art."

Blossoming_Plum,"In spite of Li Ruiqing's advocacy of Western technique in the practice and study of art, his own paintings were deeply rooted in the past, particularly in archaic forms of Chinese calligraphy preserved on ancient bronzes and stone steles. The fundamental importance of calligraphy to Li's paintings is explicit in his inscription on Blossoming Plum:Though a new branch in full bloom,The old tree remains gnarled and twisted;This is a scroll of bell-and-tripod seal-script writing,Please do not treat it as a painting."
Returning_Fisherman,"The strong, even brushline Wang Zhen learned from Wu Changshi (1844–1927) is evident in this exuberant painting. Wang's poem elaborates on the picture:The fisherman exchanges his fish for some wine.He lives east of willow-covered shoressouth of the [Yangzi] River.Returning contentedly before dusk in the setting sun,Laughing and calling to his children, as he gets tipsyin the spring breeze.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], pp. 72-76)"

Service_with_Decoration_of_Flowers_and_Birds,"The forms and decor of this tableware are purely Chinese—as opposed to silver pieces of the Tang dynasty (618–907), when metalwork in China was strongly influenced by foreign styles. The same forms occur in Song and Yuan lacquer and porcelain, while the bird-and-flower motifs reflect the influence of Song painting."
White_Peony_and_Rocks,"Hua Yan worked in the prosperous city of Yangzhou at the time of the ""Eight Eccentrics,"" a group whose bold idiosyncratic style extended beyond painting to personal attitudes and behavior. In developing the style of the early Qing masters Shitao (1642–1707), Zhu Da (1626–1705), and Yun Shouping (1633–1690), Hua made daring use of color, fresh realism in representation, and an unabashed display of brush virtuosity that made him a favorite model of late Qing and modern Chinese painters.Hua Yan favored unorthodox juxtapositions such as the one seen here: suffused ink washes for the garden rocks contrasted with lyrical and perfectly controlled color tints for the delicate blossoms and leaves. In his inscription at upper left, he gives the Song dynasty sources for these two dissimilar techniques:I follow Ma Yuan [act. ca. 1190–1225] in chopping lean rocks,And imitate Xu Xi [act. 10th century] in plucking delicate blossoms.The two masters' styles have their bitter andsweet aspects;Together they enhance the taste of my tea on the firstchilly day of autumn."
Vegetables,"When the Japanese occupation ended, Qi Baishi again posted his prices on the shops of Beijing's Liulichang and resumed selling his paintings and seals. Inflation was high and resources were scarce, but his paintings commanded high prices. Despite his success, Qi remained the humble provincial, referring in his inscription to a trip home:At forty I left home, but eventually returned.These vegetables renew my appetite.My old friends and relatives grin and ask:""Is it true that meat is stacked like mountains in the officials' homes?""(Robert H. Ellsworth et al., trans., Later Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 1800-1950, 3 vols. [New York: Random House, 1987], vol. 1, p. 161)"
Evergreen_Beauty,"Since the early 2000s, Yeung Tong Lung has painted ordinary lives in Hong Kong by juxtaposing reality and fiction, memory and observation. As important as the social documentation of urban stories in his pictures are the delicately rendered interior spaces framed through disjunctive perspectives that evoke nostalgia for the colonial Chinese city.Evergreen Beautydepicts an old-fashioned ground-floor hair salon in Hong Kong’s State Theatre shopping arcade. Through the glass storefront, we see a mixed-race woman holding an infant in the middle of the shop, her gaze averted; a man is slouched on the floor to her right. The 1970s era green floor tiles set the stage for the action figures on a shelf and movie poster on the shopfront glass that represent Hong Kong’s bygone industries and popular culture, as well as Yeung’s former career as a commercial painter. Behind the woman, a staircase leads to the upper floor, framing a backdoor passage to another part of the arcade where a Google Streetview operator walks by the Evergreen Beauty barbershop, whose Chinese and English sign is partially visible. At the lower left, reproductions of Pieter Jansz Saenredam’s church interiors allude to Yeung’s fascination with the Dutch painter’s explorations of perspective and proportion. The work itself is a metaphor for the history of painting through the act of looking as the cleverly constructed interior and lines of vision between the woman, the idle man, the gig worker, and the Google device bring together diverse viewpoints from Hong Kong to the larger narrative of global art history."
Five_Water_Buffalo,"This work shows water buffalo in different postures and from various angles to playfully convey a sense of the beloved animal's personality. The artist's inscription reveals that his family found it impossible to part with the delightful image:I painted this for a family friend. My family persuaded me to repeat the composition and keep it for ourselves, since it is rather amusing.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 167)"
Landscape,"Xiao Sun was a cofounder of the Chinese Painting Research Society (Zhongguo huaxue yanjiuhui 中國畫學研究會) in Beijing in 1920, along with prominent painter-theorists Jin Cheng and Chen Hengke. He advocated the study of late Ming/early Qing painters Shitao (1642–1707), Gong Xian (1619–1689), and Mei Qing (1623–1697). This painting of a white-robed scholar by a stream in a pine grove reveals Xiao’s interest in Shitao, especially in the color palette and the combination of wavy lines with bold dots to texture rock surfaces."
Woodpecker,"Gao Qifeng followed the example of his brother, Gao Jianfu (1878–1951), and studied art in Japan, where he encountered Western methods of realistic representation, such as shading, coloristic effects, and perspective.Here, Gao drew the blossoming branch in a dashing calligraphic style derived from Chinese eighteenth-century flower-and-bird painting, while he rendered the ruffled plumage of the woodpecker in a far more descriptive manner that includes the deft use of white highlights—a technique he learned in Japan."
Zhong_Kui,"Ren Yi, a leader of the late Qing Shanghai school of painting, was a disciple of the painter Ren Xiong (1820–1857). A prolific artist, Ren Yi commanded a wide range of techniques. In this depiction of Zhong Kui, the legendary Demon Queller, for example, he adopted the figural style of Chen Hongshou (1598–1652).During the late Qing dynasty, Zhong Kui became a popular symbol of Chinese opposition to the misrule of the Manchus and was often portrayed glowering ferociously over a motley retinue of cowering ghosts and demons. In Ren Yi's depiction, however, Zhong Kui appears as an elegant, if somewhat eccentric, scholar. His sword sheathed and a blossom stuck in his hair, he sits reading decorously beside a table laid out with archaic bronzes filled with flowers and fruits, an image that suggests it was the Chinese scholars' command of their cultural heritage rather than their military prowess that set them apart from their Manchu overlords."
Origins_of_Sound,"Born in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of northwestern China, Qin Feng received formal training in oil painting, ink painting, and calligraphy at the Shandong Art Institute and in the 1980s experimented with Western avant-garde media. Once he moved abroad, however, Qin Feng, like other contemporary expatriate artists from China, chose to return to the materials of calligraphy and traditional ink painting, merging Chinese techniques and forms with gestures from Western expressionism. His work of the last decade often explores the theme of the ""origins"" of civilization and incorporates autobiographical reflections, including his childhood memories of watching the physical torture and suffering of his parents during the Cultural Revolution (1966–76).This album was created in 1997, one year after Qin Feng moved to Berlin and had his first exhibitions in Europe. Viewed in the traditional manner, as individual leaves beginning on the far right, the composition emphasizes the passage of time. The comma-shaped dabs of bright red ink resemble drops of blood that, raining across the pages, seem to be swept by a wind, gathering together to form proto-ideographs and evolving into the Chinese characters for the cardinal directions—north, south, east, west, and center—as well as the names of the seasons. The only legible calligraphy in the work, however, quickly dissolves back into small dabs of ink. The thick, black brushstroke that sweeps horizontally across the entire work unites each pair of facing pages and resembles the heavily inked forms seen in many of Qin's massive hanging scrolls."
Willow_in_the_Morning_Breeze,"Gao Jianfu came of age with the fall of the dynasty, and like many of his contemporaries he eagerly sought solutions to China's backwardness in the culture of the West. He was fascinated with light and atmosphere as conveyed in Western painting.In this lovely fan, done after a lifetime of experimentation with Western perspective, modeling, color and chiaroscuro, Gao has created a particularly Chinese rendition of light. The gray morning sky barely reveals a crescent moon."
Portrait_of_Qian_Lou,"This painting depicts Qian Lou, a famous recluse who lived during Warring States period (c. 475–221 BC). Qian sits on a mat before a low table, where he prepares to write on an unfurled piece of paper. Brush in hand, inkstone and water pot at the ready, a bundle of scrolls at his side, Qian is depicted as the consummate humble scholar at his craft. Along the left side of the scroll, Yu transcribed a lengthy biography of Qian Lou from the third century text Gao shi zhuan (Accounts of high-minded men).The painter Yu Ming was born in Wuxing and spent much of his career in Shanghai and Beijing. Though largely aligned with traditionalist groups that advocated the continued development of traditions of classical Chinese painting, Yu was also trained in European watercolor techniques. According to Yu Ming’s second inscription, this painting is a copy of an original image of Qian Lou by the great Ming dynasty painter Wen Zhengming (1470–1559), and as such it reflects the interest in classical Chinese paintings that animated many of Yu’s patrons in Beijing and Shanghai."
Shadow,"Shao was exposed to art from an early age: both his parents taught Soviet-style oil painting, and his father had a collection of traditional painting, calligraphy, and furniture, which he was able to retain during the Cultural Revolution owing to his high status in the Communist party. Shao studied wood carving and porcelain making in Beijing, but soon began to rethink much of what he studied at school, and to explore “how to be a Chinese artist, by trial and error.” This led, in 1995, to his famous Chair series in which historic Ming-style forms are reconstructed into sleek, sometimes surreal, modern hybrids using contemporary forms, techniques, and materials. Teasing the boundaries between art and design, these works not only illuminate aesthetic connections across time and culture, but in a way also demonstrate how China’s past can both adapt to and coexist with its rapidly changing and increasingly globalized present."
500_Brushstrokes_#10,"Viewed from a distance, Wu Jian’an’s 500 Brushstrokes, #10 appears to be a riot of gestural ink brushstrokes spread across a massive rectangle of absorbent Xuan paper—the work of an artist possessed by urgent forces of expression that poured forth without restraint. Upon closer examination, the work’s deliberate, even painstaking, composite nature becomes apparent. Each of the dynamic brushstrokes has been carefully cut out of its original context and collaged into the larger whole using traditional Chinese conservation techniques, which allow for nearly seamless layering of paper on paper. In scale and aesthetic, the resulting work evokes the passion and gestalt of postwar American action painting, but its material orientation reveals a more nuanced and layered understanding of abstraction. Wu’s work invites us to question inherited assumptions about the meaning and mechanics of large-scale gestural abstraction, which are so heavily textured by the lionizing stories of Pollock, Kline, and others of their generation. Far from the urgent outpouring of emotion that it seems at first, 500 Brushstrokes is a celebration of deliberation, craftsmanship, material, and conservation technique. In this way, Wu has incorporated not only postwar American abstraction, but also premodern Chinese painting and conservation to the layered portfolio of inspirations that have led to this highly original artwork."
Gibbons_and_Deer,"This painting is a rebus or pictorial pun, that conveys a wish for success on an examination. The Chinese title of the painting, Yuan lu (""gibbons and deer""), is a homophone for the expression ""First [place gains] power."" Thus, the painting must be read as a text, its images read as words."
The_Virtuous_Being,"This work is a complex and layered homage to the history of literati gardens. The scroll begins by reimagining the most famous garden painting in Chinese history, Wang Wei’s (699–759) Wangchuan Villa, as a series of ghostly ruins. Slowly, the scroll transitions to color from black and white. The painting then shifts to an exploration of the Ming-dynasty garden of the scholar Wang Shizhen, in Taicang, Jiangsu. From there, Hao takes the viewer on a journey to the present day, where Wang’s garden, which was destroyed in the twentieth century, has been rebuilt. The new garden features a garish Ferris wheel, which Hao shows spinning off its axis and spewing its cars across the scroll, across boundaries of space and time."
Primeval_Chaos,"Measuring nearly five feet tall and one hundred feet long when fully unrolled, Ren’s cosmic vision of an amorphous world follows the format and medium of traditional painting, but the scale, subject matter, and the industrial material on which it was painted owe nothing to earlier Chinese art forms. The scroll blends Eastern and Western imagery—cosmic spheroids and mandala-like drawings; swirling vortices and hovering clouds—in a succession of crescendos as it unrolls from left to right, a departure from the right-left orientation of traditional handscrolls. Further distancing the work from Chinese precedents is the use of Western-style chiaroscuro to describe the clouds, hills, and other landscape elements."
Setting_Sun_on_the_Autumn_River,"As the sun sets behind him, a solitary scholar sits in the prow of a skiff on a placid river. On the nearby bank a grove of trees explodes in autumn colors, while on the distant shore a stand of trees is silhouetted against a mountain ridge. The river is often presented in Chinese painting as a place of escape from the cares of the world; in his boat, far removed from official duties, the scholar meets true repose."
"Stamping_the_Water_(Performance_in_the_Lhasa_River,_Tibet,_1996)","Song began his career as an oil painter, but in the years after 1989 he increasingly shifted his focus to installation and performance art.These iconic photographs capture Song’s most famous performance, in which he sat in the Lhasa River in Tibet for an hour repeatedly stamping the water with a large wood seal carved with the Chinese character for water (shui 水). The piece is, among other things, a meditation on the evanescence of inscribed language. As Song has said, “I exerted great force [in stamping the seal on the water], but in the end left no trace.”"
Landscape_with_figure,"At the center of a vortex of bold ink marks, a small figure in a wide-brimmed hat walks along a mountain path. The experimental, nearly abstract quality of this landscape was inspired by the seventeenth-century painter Shitao, whom Qian Shoutie admired as a sign of the advanced, modern spirit inherent in classical Chinese painting. The contrast between the chaotic intensity of the landscape and the solidity of the man who strides confidently at its center underscores the idea of the recluse as an intrepid figure who daringly walks his own path."
Portrait_of_Laozi,"This painting depicts the Daoist philosopher Laozi seated cross-legged on a humble reed mat. The Laozi in this image is not the deified figure revered in religious Daoism, but rather the man who walked the earth prior to his deification. Wearing a simple white scholar’s robe and black hat, Laozi sits surrounded by books, an allusion to his role as royal archivist at the court of the Zhou dynasty. The artist has used tones of ochre to describe a deeply pitted face wizened with age.The painter Yu Ming was born in Wuxing and spent much of his career in Shanghai and Beijing. Though largely aligned with traditionalist groups that advocated the continued development of classical Chinese painting, Yu was also trained in European watercolor techniques. According to the long inscription by Yu’s friend Xu Zonghao, most of which transcribes Laozi’s biography in the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) by Sima Qian (c. 145–c. 86 BCE), this painting is a copy of an original image of Laozi by the great Yuan dynasty painter Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322), and as such it reflects the interest in classical Chinese paintings that animated many of Yu’s patrons in Beijing and Shanghai."
Seascape_at_Beidaihe,"In 1936 Wu Guanzhong enrolled in the Hangzhou Academy of Art, where he studied Western oil painting under Lin Fengmian (1900–1991). From 1947 to 1950 he was in Paris, immersing himself in the works of Cézanne, Gauguin, and Matisse before returning to China as a lecturer at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. Wu's modernism conflicted with the views of the academy's director and with the Social Realist style of Soviet models and he was trans-ferred to another post. During the Cultural Revolution he was sent into the countryside for three years and did not paint. Wu began working in Chinese ink on paper only after 1972.In this work, inspired by Mao Zedong's poem about the summer resort of Beidaihe, Wu translated actual scenery into a composition that verges on abstraction. Except for the boats that dot the horizon and the black silhouettes of protruding rocks, the surface is given over to a mesmerizing depiction of waves. Wu painted out some of his ink lines with opaque white—something a traditional Chinese artist would never do—to prevent linear patterns from predominating over the illusion of light reflected from the water. In contrast to the literati objective of capturing the essence of the natural world through abstract calligraphic brushwork, Wu exploited the tension between abstraction and the vivid evocation of three-dimensional forms to create an intensely personal encounter with nature."
Yan_Family_Temple_Stele,"The calligraphy reproduced in this rubbing was engraved on a stone stele erected at the family temple of the official and calligrapher Yan Zhenqing. The text on the stele, which is dedicated to Yan's father, records the achievements of earlier generations of the family. The original stele is preserved today in the Forest of Stelae in Xi'an. Although many forms of calligraphy were practiced during the Tang dynasty, standard script from that period had the greatest impact on the later history of the art. In standard script, exemplified by Yan's stele inscription, square-shaped characters are written with articulated strokes that have complex turns, hooks, and dots.From the Tang dynasty on, this script type was used extensively for formal documents and public monuments. Standard script is the form of calligraphy first learned by children and is the basis for the typefaces used in Chinese printing. One of the most influential artists in Chinese history, Yan Zhenqing was also a prominent statesman of the Tang dynasty and suffered a martyr's death when he refused to submit to rebels intent on overthrowing the dynasty. This monumental writing is seen by scholars of calligraphy as a powerful reflection of Yan's unconquerable integrity."
Lotus_Peak,"This small album leaf, which depicts one of the principal peaks of Yellow Mountain, resembles a sketch from nature in its sensitively drawn contours. Done when the artist was nearly eighty, it eschews the bravura brushwork of a decade earlier in favor of juxtaposed areas of ink wash and uninked paper that create the effect of sun and shadow, white clouds and verdant valleys. This experimentation with Western ideas and techniques, reflected in Liu Haisu's drawing style and in his strongly contrasted areas of light and dark, was a way of liberating him-self from traditional constraints. His inscription reads:""I haven't painted for a long time. [My brush] has grown cold and clumsy. It is a pleasure to wash away [styles] of the past and present.""(Robert H. Ellsworth et al., trans., Later Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 1800-1950, 3 vols. [New York: Random House, 1987], vol. 1, p. 212)."
Two_Riders,"Bao Shichen, a literatus better known as a seal carver and calligrapher than as a painter, wrote an influential treatise, Paired Oars for the Boat of Art, in support of the bold calligraphic styles found in carved stone monuments (bei) of the Six Dynasties period. Bao's appreciation of the new aesthetic led others to value contemporary experiments in bei styles by such calligraphers as Deng Shiru (1743–1805).Bao's calligraphy, still in the style of informal brush-written models (tie), dominates this painting, not only in the form of a long inscription but also in the emblematic use of a conventional image rendered in simply brushed ink line and wash. The inscription is Bao's commentary on ambition:Some chase fame at court. Some chase gain in the market. He who attains fame returns content; he who attains wealth returns secure. There are so many who never cease to strive. The universe is huge and never-ending, with myriads of people and as many ambitions.Trans. adapted from Ellsworth et al., Later Chinese Painting]But nowhere is the huge universe would Bao's ambitions be satisfied: he repeated failed the examinations for the jinshi (presented scholar) degree that would have earned him a higher post in government service."
Beneficent_Rain,"Zhang Yucai, the thirty-eighth pope of the Zhengyi (""Orthodox Unity"") Daoist church, lived at Mount Longhu (Dragon Tiger Mountain) in Jiangxi Province. A favorite of the Yuan emperors, he received commendation from the Mongol court for inducing needed rain and for subduing a ""tide monster"" that had plagued the eastern seacoast.Dragons, as symbols of nature's elemental forces, have been depicted in Chinese art from time immemorial. A special genre, dragon paintings were given powerful treatment by such Southern Song masters as Chen Rong (act. ca. 1235-62) and the Chan Buddhist painter Muqi (act. ca. 1240-75). In a fourteenth-century account, Chen's working methods are described as follows: He ""makes clouds by splashing ink, creates vapor by spraying water, and, while drunk, shouting loudly, takes off his cap, soaks it in ink, and smears and rubs with it, before finishing the painting with a brush.""On Chen Rong's celebrated Nine Dragons handscroll dated 1244, in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, there is a colophon dated 1331 by Zhang Yucai's son Zhang Sicheng, the thirty-ninth Daoist pope (r. 1317–44). Beneficent Rain is closely related to Chen Rong's Nine Dragons both in content and in style, and may have been directly inspired by the Boston scroll or others like it."
The_Mythos_of_Lost_Dynasties-Form_C:_Pseudo-seal_Scripture_in_Calligraphic_Copybook_Format,"Created from 1983 to 1987, the Pseudo-seal Scripture in Calligraphic Copybook Format series consists of 50 works that each showcases ten seal-script characters written within a two-by-five grid. The characters are typically set against an amorphous background that resembles clouds or mist. Gu achieved this effect by splashing water over the half-dried ink of the written characters—a signature process developed and deployed by the artist in many of his conceptual paintings during the 1980s. In the current gift, the splashy patterns of ink appear to originate from the characters and radiate outwards.Confidently executed in fluid forms with lines of uniform width, Gu’s characters resemble traditional seal script writing, an early form of Chinese script that came to be used for seals carved from stone or cast from bronze, but they are in fact characters invented by Gu, who has combined familiar ideographic components to create nonsensical forms. Though they have the authoritative visual presence of seal script, none of the characters is legible. The gridded arrangement, which heightens the work’s initial impression of authority, is taken from the copybook format, the foundational tool of basic training for young calligraphers. It is through repetitive copying from copybooks that amateur calligraphers master the fundamentals of script types and composition. By undermining the viewers’ assumption of the characters’ legitimacy and the authority of the copying practice, Gu questions the function of language in documenting history and disseminating culture. While Gu’s conceptual engagement with language at the time was influenced by his study of Western texts, particularly those of Wittgenstein, Freud, Nietzsche, and Popper, his works ultimately addressed the unique situations of contemporary China. Gu has said, “most Chinese people, even educated ones, are unable to read seal-script characters. This idea of ‘unreadability’ conveyed a mythical sense of infinity and eternity to me…In their outright rejection of classical Chinese traditions and in their suggestion of something clandestine, the Pseudo-Characters series represented my first brush with a societal taboo.” (Wu Hung, Transience:Chinese Experimental Art at the End of the Twentieth Century. Chicago: David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art, University of Chicago, 1999, p. 41)The appearance of newsprint impressions in the areas of ink wash is the result of using newspaper to absorb the water that Gu poured over the written surface to achieve a blurred effect (August 1, 2013 email exchange with Guo Zhen, Gu's ex-wife, who sometimes participated in the production of Gu’s works in the 1980s).Two red seals are stamped on the upper and lower left corners in the lower left grid Wenda 文达 (the artist’s name) and xinhe心壑 (meaning “gullies of the mind”)."
Cup_with_figures_in_a_landscape,"The chalice-like shape of this vessel derives from Western prototypes while the lush decoration on its interior surface is typically Chinese: figures in a landscape, elegant floral scrolls, and birds flying against a geometric background."
Lady_catching_a_butterfly,"Like his friend Zhang Daqian, whom he accompanied to Dunhuang, Xie Zhiliu was obsessed with Chinese painting history. He used his time among the ancient murals of the desert oasis to expand his horizons as a painter and an art historian. Like Zhang, Xie was fascinated by the female figures he saw there—especially the brightly colored examples from the Tang dynasty (618–907). According to Xie’s inscription, this was made shortly after his return from Dunhuang using techniques he learned from studying the Tang murals."
Bamboo_and_rocks,"Li Kan was a northern Chinese who entered the service of the Mongol government at an early period and rose to a high position in the Yuan court. The author of an authoritative treatise on bamboo painting, Li stated that the painter must possess ""the complete bamboo in [his] breast,"" and he urged statesmen to take up bamboo painting to discipline their minds and expand their breadth of vision.Li completed these panels in 1318, the year the Mongol regime reinstituted the civil-service examinations, the chief means for scholars to gain access to official positions. The painting is done in the shuangou, or ""double-outline,"" style of bamboo painting. This technique, in which finely drawn ink outlines are filled in with dense mineral pigments, was ideally suited to Li Kan's intense identification with bamboo. Minutely observed and intricately rendered, these noble plants take on a heightened sense of reality that approaches portraiture."
Plantain_Lily,"The strong interplay of color and ink, decorative appeal and calligraphy updates the tradition of flower painting that had evolved in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Chen's freer brushwork and bright color mark a direction that Chinese painting would take in the succeeding decades, and his influential position as a teacher and mentor served to carve out that path."
Ci_Poem_by_Su_Shi,"In this piece written for his daughter Taiyi, Lin Yutang transcribes a poem by the renowned literatus Su Shi (1037–1101). This poem describes, in a humorous tone, an awkward situation Su Shi encountered when he was banished to Huangzhou (present-day Huanggang, Hubei) from 1080 to 1084. Being locked out of his own house late one night, he transformed his predicament into an aesthetic experience:After a drink at night at Dongpo [in Huangzhou],I wake up and get drunk again;By the time I come home it seems to be midnight.The boy servant is asleep, snoring like thunder,And does not answer the door.Resting on a cane I listen to the murmur of the river.I always regret that I am not master of my own life.When can I stop this hustling about?The night is late, the air is calm, and the water has a sheen of unruffled light.Let me take a small boat down the river hence,To spend beyond the seas the remainder of my days.(trans. after Lin Yutang)Su Shi's self-mockery certainly appealed to Lin Yutang, the Chinese master of humor. In his biography of Su, The Gay Genius: The Life and Times of Su Tungpo (1947), Lin describes him as ""an incorrigible optimist, a great humanitarian, a friend of the people, a prose master, an original painter, a great calligraphist, an experimenter in wine making, an engineer, a hater of Puritanism, a yogi, a Buddhist believer, a Confucian statesman, a secretary to the emperor, a confirmed winebibber, a humane judge, a dissenter in politics, a prowler in the moonlight, a poet, and a wag."""
Pear_Blossoms,"The strong interplay of color and ink, decorative appeal and calligraphy updates the tradition of flower painting that had evolved in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Chen's freer brushwork and bright color mark a direction that Chinese painting would take in the succeeding decades, and his influential position as a teacher and mentor served to carve out that path."
Buddhist_Sage,"A successful Shanghai businessman as well as a devout Buddhist, Wang Zhen is best known for his paintings of Buddhist figures in the calligraphic brush manner of his mentor, Wu Changshi (1844–1927). This large-scale work, made one year after his master's death, not only reveals Wang's devotion to Chan (Zen) Buddhism but may also refer to his role as Wu's disciple. The painting portrays the legendary Indian monk Bodhidharma, who is credited with introducing Chan Buddhism into China, and his Chinese disciple Huike, who cut off his arm to demonstrate his spiritual conviction and prove his worthiness to become a follower. Wang's use of rich colors and bold ink dots and slashes in his description of the landscape is typical of his teacher's style; the simplified outlines of his figures, however, may be inspired by the works of such Song- and Yuan-dynasty Chan painters as Liang Kai (active early 13th century) and Yintuoluo (active ca. 1340), whose paintings Wang could have seen on his business trips to Japan.Wang's inscription reads:A sage from the WestPreaches the miraculous doctrine of the Upper Vehicle.Preaching, he sits under a bodhi tree,With roosting birds listening in silence.The Wheel of the Law is as bright as a full moon,Its precious light illuminating the lamp of transmission.Ailing worshipers travel from afarTo receive guidance from the monk at the stone cave.(Wen C. Fong, trans., in Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], pp. 76-77)"
Man_in_a_Forest,"Fu Baoshi did not devote himself fully to painting until after 1939, when he settled in the wartime capital of Chongqing, Sichuan. There, poverty-stricken and struggling to support a growing family, he painted with a fierce determination to succeed. Often, he created images of himself in the guise of tragic historical figures who were not adequately appreciated during their lifetime. In this work, dating to the early 1940s, he depicts himself lost in a thick grove of trees and bamboo. His inscription quotes lines from a poem by Du Fu (712–770):Pity that the young pine trees cannot grow a thousand feet tall, So let the thicket of bamboo be cut down by the tens of thousands.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 121)"
"Bhadra,_The_Sixth_Luohan","Luohans (arhats, in Sanskrit) or ""worthy ones"" are disciples of Shakyamuni Buddha to whom he entrusted the guardianship of the Buddhist law. In China these enlightened beings became the focus of popular veneration and were typically shown in groups of sixteen, eighteen, or five hundred.This painting of the sixth luohan, one of twelve that survive from a set of eighteen, is typical of the Chinese treatment of this subject. Inspired by the powerful portraits of individual luohans created by the monk-artist Guanxiu (832–912), the figure is dressed like a monk but given exotic facial features to emphasize his non-Chinese origins. Shown as dwelling in the wilderness, his appearance of spiritual authority is enhanced by his frequent companion, a tiger, which is also the Chinese cosmological symbol of the West."
Plum,"The strong interplay of color and ink, decorative appeal and calligraphy updates the tradition of flower painting that had evolved in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Chen's freer brushwork and bright color mark a direction that Chinese painting would take in the succeeding decades, and his influential position as a teacher and mentor served to carve out that path."
Searching_for_My_Parents,"This painting illustrates Huang Xiangjian's perilous journey through Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces in one of the most celebrated acts of filial piety in late imperial Chinese history. In 1643 Huang's father was appointed county magistrate in Yunnan, and for nearly a decade thereafter, Huang heard nothing from his parents. Not knowing whether they had survived the ravages of warfare following the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, he set out in 1652 from his home in Suzhou and traveled over 1,400 miles in search of his parents. In his vivid published account, Huang describes the many hardships he endured before being reunited with his parents in rural Yunnan. He eventually escorted them back home, completing his round-trip journey in 558 days.Painted three years after his return, this handscroll documents the most arduous portion of the journey, including treacherous mountain trails and the military garrisons where he faced interrogation. Impoverished, injured, and sobbing, he often had to convince armed troops that he was not a spy but was merely trying to obtain passage in search of his parents. In his inscription, he expresses the hope that the painting will ""exorcise the nightmares"" that still haunted him."
Vase,"Guan ware was produced exclusively for the imperial court in Hangzhou, the capital of the Southern Song dynasty during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The unctuous glaze with subtle blue tone and icy crackles on these works is considered among the top achievements of Chinese ceramics."
The_Poetry_Cottage,"This painting of a cottage hidden among bamboo conveys the longings of the yimin (literally, leftover subjects) of the Qing for another time and place.Lin had a Confucian education, obtaining a juren degree in 1882. His landscape style was based on Wen Zhenming and Daoji. Lin Shu's style was so popular that his studio was called ""The Mint."" In 1919 he was an outspoken critic of the ""new culture"" movement which called for use of the vernacular instead of the classical language in literature. At the same time, Lin Shu was among the first to make Western literature available in China. Although he knew no English, he rendered into classical Chinese several Western novels as recounted to him by a French missionary."
Ewer_with_Parrots,"Introduced to China in the first and second century, tropical parrots from mainland and island Southeast Asia quickly became a motif in the decorative arts, valued for their exoticism and their purported ability to speak Chinese."
Roof_tile_end_with_tiger,"In ancient Chinese cosmology, the tiger symbolizes the western quadrant of the four cardinal directions. The animal was depicted on molded bricks, roof tiles, and walls of buildings to protect the living, as well as on architectural parts of tomb chambers to guard the deceased in the afterlife."
Sichuan_Landscape,"During World War II Lu Yanshao painted in the mountains of Sichuan. In this rare work from the end of the Cultural Revolution he re-created from memory the dramatic scenery that he encountered there as he recounts in his inscription:The southwest is especially famous for the beauty of its caves and valleys. This is not because it is described as such, because of its ""reputation."" One day, when I was living in Sichuan in the mountains across a river, I came upon a huge and mysterious cave, with waterfalls gushing forth from the rocks, in the midst of a beautiful and serene setting. Even after more than thirty years I have not forgotten it. I have now painted it to share with those who might enjoy it.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 253)"
404,"This is a horizontally formatted ink painting made on absorbent Chinese paper. The entirety of the paper is covered in an overall field of saturated ink wash that varies from very dilute to nearly jet black. The ink is arrayed across the surface in irregular shapes that call to mind tiny multicellular organisms seen through a microscope—small in some places, large in others, pushing and pulling as they merge into one another and separate. In places, the edges of these shapes are fringed with fractal patterns where ink has bled into moistened paper in uncontrollable ways. Into the abstract, overall field, Li Huasheng has inserted the barest suggestion of representation: five houses, perched on the upper ridges of two of these irregular shapes, thereby transforming the entire roiling mass into a landscape."
Tiered_box_“Green_Gold”,"This magnificent box epitomizes the top-quality of contemporary Chinese lacquerware. Recognized in 2012 as a National Crafts Master of China, the artist, Gan Erke, has established a new standard for lacquer craftsmanship as well as reinvigorating this traditional art with new technical innovations. Preeminent among Gan’s varied lacquer styles is the marbled technique known as “rhinoceros hide” (xipi), a kind of millefiori effect achieved through the application of multiple layers of colored lacquer. Gan not only picked up this traditional craft, but also added new innovations, most notably his bold color combinations—evidenced here. The predominance green pigment together with gold foil is a color scheme for which there is no historical precedent. Rather, this represents the artist’s innovative aesthetic experimentation."
Cultivating_Longevity,"Chen Hengke's knowledge of the modern period, gained during his studies in Japan between 1902 and 1909, gave him a distance from his own tradition. Yet he was able, from this vantage, to reaffirm his belief in the enduring vitality of Chinese calligraphy and painting. An influential historian of the literati tradition and a leader among painters and calligraphers in Beijing, Chen died before he reached fifty, but the many artists who were his friends and students, among them Qi Baishi (1863–1957), advanced his ideals.Chen's approach to landscape painting demonstrates the shift in the modern period away from pictorial to graphic principles. While working with traditional media and subject matter, Chen employed an assertive brushwork that is virtually independent of the painting's representational function."
Mountain_Rain_is_Coming,"Born as Feng Yaheng into a wealthy landowner family in Sichuan, Shi Lu studied traditional painting in Chengdu but left school in 1939 for Yan'an in Shaanxi Province, the wartime headquarters of the Communist Party after the Long March. He changed his name to Shi Lu as an expression of his admiration for the individualist painter Shitao (1642–1707) and the revolutionary writer Lu Xun (1881–1936). During the 1940s Shi Lu espoused the revolutionary aims of the Communist Party, creating cartoons, woodcuts, New Year's pictures, and other forms of propagandist art. After 1950 he embraced Russian-inspired Social Realism in large-scale works on such subjects as the history of the Chinese Communist Revolution.This painting marks a change in Shi Lu's style. His peasants, bearing their load through the landscape, reflect training in Social Realism, but the free brushwork and wild ink of his mountains echo the work of Shitao."
Winter_Landscape_after_Wang_Hui’s_Interpretation_of_Shen_Zhou,"In this winter landscape, the succession of scenes, presented from a constantly shifting perspective, moves between distant views and close-ups in a dynamic progression. The juxtaposition of leafy pines and bare deciduous trees, the gleaming snow on the terrain and treetops, and darkened sky evoke the chill of the season.Fu Shen is a major modern artist working in the classical mode of Chinese scholarly art. This work embodies his achievement in all its three branches, namely, painting, calligraphy, and seal-carving. This painting is exemplary of the way in which traditional Chinese painters learn their craft by copying the works of ancient masters. It is a 20th-century artist Fu Shen’s copy of a Qing dynasty (1644–1911) court painter Wang Hui’s interpretation of a Ming dynasty (1368–1644) scholar-artist Shen Zhou’s work. Most interestingly, as all the connoisseurs point out, Fu’s painting captures the essence of Shen’s style, which demonstrates the conscientious and successful emulation of Wang Hui as well as Fu Shen."
"Buddha,_probably_Amitabha","The position of the Buddha’s arms indicates that the hands were once held in a gesture of meditation and suggests that this sculpture represents Amitabha, a celestial Buddha who presides over his Western Paradise. Devotion to Amitabha, a major component of Chinese Buddhist practice since the sixth century, promotes the goal of rebirth in Amitabha’s Pure Land, where conditions are conducive to achieving spiritual understanding.The sculpture was made using the dry-lacquer technique, in which a core (often made of wood) is covered with clay and then wrapped in layers of cloth that have been saturated with lacquer— a tree resin that hardens when exposed to oxygen. As many as seven or eight additional layers of lacquer might then be applied. In the eighth century, this technique spread from China to Japan, where it was used widely in the production of Buddhist sculptures."
Portrait_of_Zhao_Zhiqian,"Zhao Zhiqian, one of the most influential calligraphers and painters of the late Qing period, inscribed his portrait:If the world praises me, I shall not accept such praise,Of those who try to destroy me, I shall not complain.Only the painter can capture my likeness. Hanging on the wall it will inspire people to call out, ""It is Zhao, it is Zhao!"" I neither walk nor sit but stand alone, and with a smile say nothing.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 40)Brush vitality, not optical fidelity, was the traditional criterion for lifelikeness in Chinese painting, except in portraiture. For this reason portrait painting was traditionally held in low regard in China. The praise that Zhao, a scholar-artist, voices for the lifelikeness of his portrait testifies to the growing respect in the nineteenth century for verisimilitude as a criterion applicable in all the fine arts."
Dwelling_in_the_Xixia_Mountains,"Huang credited his inspiration for this landscape, painted the year before he died, to Wang Wei (701–761) and Zhao Lingrang (act. ca. 1070–after 1100). The three artists grappled with the problems of how to use ink to render the complementary relationship of solid and void. The unpainted white of Huang's mountains defines their volume and the palpability of his mists creates space. The inscription reads:Living in the Xixia mountains and viewing the peaks to the north and south at dawn, I gaze at the verdant hills and russet forests that nearly cover the village by the lakeshore. I painted this in the styles of Wang Wei and Zhao Lingrang.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 182)"
Catfish,"Qi Baishi's great admiration for the paintings of Bada Shanren (1626–1705), in which a few deft brushstrokes might conjure forth a fish, bird, or plant that is at once beguilingly simple yet psychologically complex, convincingly solid yet set within a composition that is spatially ambiguous, is conveyed in his frankly imitative Catfish, with its self-mocking inscription:I once saw Zhu Xuege's [Bada's] painting of a small fish less than three inches long and filled with natural vitality. Today, I took a piece of old wrapping paper and painted on it this [fish], which measures more than ten inches in length. But mine is not as skilled and sturdy as Xuege's. I feel ashamed!(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 161)"
Mountains_Clearing_after_Rain,"This small landscape exemplifies Zhang Daqian's splashed-ink-and-color method of painting, which he developed in the mid-1960s. In such paintings, he first applied washes of layered ink and intense colors in a semiautomatic manner, then added images of houses, trees, and other details to transform his atmospheric coloring into a suggestive three-dimensional landscape. According to Zhang's inscription, ""the peaks along the river separate the clearing slopes from the rain.""Zhang's exposure to Western abstract art played a crucial role in the development of his new style. His acquaintance with Zao Wou-ki (b. 1921), a Chinese expatriate painter working in Paris, was particularly important. In the early 1950s Zao often saturated his canvases with overlapping layers of color onto which he would draw houses, boats, and other figurative motifs. His integration of the abstract with the figurative and the sense of atmospheric expansiveness through nuanced use of color may have inspired Zhang Daqian's splashed painting in both concept and approach."
Buddha_of_Longevity,"A native of Linquan, Jiangxi Province, Li Ruiqing passed the palace (jinshi) examination in 1895 and served as a scholar in the esteemed Hanlin Academy. After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, he remained loyal to the fallen Qing dynasty (1644–1911) and took the sobriquet ""Qingdaoren"" (Qing Daoist). He moved to Shanghai and eked out a living selling his paintings and calligraphies.This depiction of the Buddha of Longevity is highly unconventional and provocative. Instead of being shown in his Western Paradise, the Buddha sits alone in a cave, recalling the Chan (Zen) patriarch Bodhidharma meditating before a cliff face and bringing to mind the ideal of the individual pursuit of enlightenment through spiritual striving and physical austerity. Li's strident palette and intentionally naive drawing style may be intended to evoke the primary colors and archaic style found in Buddhist wall paintings of sixth- and seventh-century cave temples at Dunhuang, but his assertive contour lines and dynamic composition have a self-conscious quality that is distinctly modern. Li's inscription on a rock, which recalls the weather-worn monumental writings on cliffs, expresses the desire for release from an existence that, from a political point of view, he finds painful:On the fifth day of the fifth month of 1917, Qingdaoren painted this Buddha of Longevity with respect. [I] pray that [I] will be reborn in the Western paradise and be released from this sordid existence forever. All people should have this good fortune.(Robert H. Ellsworth et al., trans., Later Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 1800-1950, 3 vols. [New York: Random House, 1987], vol. 1, p. 113)"
Charging_Yak,"Wu Zuoren studied Western art techniques and methods with Xu Beihong in Shanghai before going to Europe in 1930. He studied at the école des Beaux Arts, Paris, and under Alfred Bastien at the Académie Royale in Brussels. Wu mastered charcoal sketching and oil painting for making realistic anatomical studies but came to view these techniques as merely preliminary steps toward achieving a seemingly spontaneous style using Chinese ink and paper.Returning to China in 1935, Wu taught under Xu Beihong at Nanjing Central University and followed the university to Chongqing during the war. In 1943 he began traveling in the Tibetan plateau and Qinghai region, living with herdsmen while painting yaks and camel caravans on the vast highland plains. After 1949 Wu's sympathetic portrayals of minority peoples became consonant with the political agenda: to broaden the appeal of art, address the lives of the common folk, and confirm a nationalistic spirit."
Landscape_after_Wu_Zhen,"According to his inscription, Wang Yuanqi did this landscape in the manner of the Yuan painter Wu Zhen (1280–1354). But in Wang's interpretation, Wu Zhen's distinctive idiom of dragged texture strokes and dotting has been used to create a densely patterned scene in which foreground and distant mountains are fused into a continuous ""dragon vein"" of abstract compositional energy.Wang's poem reads:In olden days, Wu Daozi [active 8th century] saw Fei Min perform in a sword dance, and, letting his brush fly, he did a wall painting. When Zhang Xu [active mid-8th century] saw the way the carriers balance the loads on their poles, his ""draft"" script became even more refined. When I saw Shao Jiuji, I joyously had a sudden insight and casually did this picture. Although past and present painters cannot reach each other, yet what the mind comprehends and the hand responds to—this means the same for all. I am giving this away for a laugh.(Ashwin Lippe, trans., in Laurence Sickman, ed., Chinese Calligraphy and Painting in the Collection of John M. Crawford, Jr. [New York: Pierpont Morgan Library, 1962], p. 164)"
Quatrain_on_Snow-covered_West_Lake,"This fan is not dated, but the style of the writing is very close to that of Lizong's inscription accompanying Landscape at Sunset (Nezu Museum, Tokyo), a painting by the court artist Ma Lin (active ca. 1180–after 1256) that is dated 1254. The poem probably describes the scenery around West Lake in Hangzhou, the capital of the Southern Song dynasty:On the lake, a bright frozen mist lingers;On the lake, brilliant sights beckon.From the pavilion, I gaze at the mountain peaks;The color of snow and a hazy vapor shine in mywinecup.(Wen C. Fong, trans., in Beyond Representation:Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 8th-14th Century[New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art,1992], p. 239)"
Drunken_Old_Farmer,"Feng Zikai's intellectual development was fostered under the tutelage of the influential Buddhist scholar and painter Li Shutong (Hongyi, 1880–1942). Feng later studied in Japan, learning Western drawing and music and discovering the Japanese cartoon tradition. When he returned to China, he answered the call for an art responsive to the needs of an broadly defined national culture with moving, humane depictions of common people in real situations, using a cartoonlike style based on woodblock illustration. This image, which derives from a woodblock print by Feng dated 1940, was painted after 1948, as indicated to by an artist's seal that states, ""Done after attaining the age of fifty."" The simple linear drawing, enlivened with color, illustrates lines from a poem describing an old man leaving a country tavern:An old drunken farmer staggers as if dancing,Supported by two children who help him back to the boat.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 133)"
Small_dwelling_in_a_dense_grove_of_trees,"A small, white-walled building sits partially hidden within a dense grove of tall trees. From the vegetation that grows up and over the distressed walls and roof of the structure, one senses that it is long neglected, if not a ruin, yet signs of human habitation linger in the form of chickens and an ox. Something round, likely a millstone, can be seen behind the wall of the compound. At the upper right of the scroll, the painter’s signature reads, “Painted three days before the winter solstice in the gengxu year of the Yongzheng reign period by Zaidong, Chen Mei.”Chen Mei was an artist from Songjiang (in today’s Shanghai) who traveled north to serve the Qing court, where he studied with Jiao Bingzhen, a leading court painter who had trained in both European and Chinese painting techniques. This painting, dated 1730, is relatively early in Chen’s oeuvre, but it postdates his arrival at the court in Beijing, and it seems to evince a familiarity with European visual culture. Though he executed the work using exclusively Chinese materials of brush, ink, and the mineral and vegetable pigments, the painter also layered ink and pigments of close tonal value to create a diffuse, almost airbrushed effect that seems inspired by the play of light in European paintings.Though he worked as a painter in the imperial workshops, Chen Mei also took work from private clients, and this painting comes from the latter context."
Clouds_and_Waterfalls_at_Yangdang,"Lu Yanshao, from the Jiading district of Shanghai, received his early training from literati artists in the circle of the noted scholar-painter and connoisseur Wu Hufan (1894–1970).During the war Lu augmented his study of the ancient masters by painting landscapes. Rather than depict these mountains from a distance, however, Lu cropped the image so that there is neither horizon nor repoussoir. The viewer is plunged into the midst of the landscape, where the visual drama is reinforced by the immediacy of the vigorous texture strokes and colorful washes.Lu's inscription reads:Early morning clouds rest halfway of the ridge, and waterfalls are draped across the thousand peaks. How magnificent is this view of the Yandang Mountain. Only after a long rain can you know its wonders.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 254)"
Lotus,"This artist, traditionally educated and trained, eschews the bright palette of the 19th and 20th centuries and returns to the soft washes and light pigments of Yun Shouping (1633–90). Wu's poem likens the lotus flower to the concubine of the Tang Emperor Minghuang (r. 713–56). The emperor, distracted by her beauty invited an insurrection that cost him his life. Wu's poem reads:The water-mirror breaks and the night dew is heavy.The red-clothed [beauty] is confined to the pond.Her glancing moth-like eyebrows can move a country.Have you ever seen Yang Gueifei warmed by wine?[Trans. Ellsworth et al, Later Chinese Painting]"
Narcissus_and_Orchid,"Chen Hengke's studies in Japan gave him the distance from his own tradition that only the modern period could provide, and from this vantage he reaffirmed a belief in the enduring vitality of Chinese calligraphy and painting. His composition of fragrant flowers recalls the generations of painters from Wu Changshi back through Li Futang (act. ca. 1711–62), Hua Yen (1682–ca. 1765) and Chen Chun (1483–1544), who preceded him. His inscription touches gently upon the theme of China's beloved rivers, the Xiao and Xiang and the river Luo."
Landscape,"The poem inscribed by Luo Hui on this painting reads:The sunset's shimmering rays weave andtwist following the sail;Receding mountain light sets off the pagoda.As one looks up from the river,The water continues to flow unattended.[Trans. adapted from Ellsworth et all, Later Chinese Painting]The literatus Dong Qichang is invoked in the inscription as the source for Luo's style, but the painting embodies more a 19th century notion of the ""picturesque"" than Dong's intellectual style."
Untitled,"Untitled, like all of Qiu Shihua’s mature paintings, appears upon first impression to be nothing more than a blank white canvas (Figure 1). Extended viewing, however, reveals forms beneath layered applications of white paint, which begin to coalesce into a legible scene if given sufficient time to emerge. In the case of Untitled, which Qiu painted in 2006 during an extended stay in the San Francisco Bay Area, groupings of gray marks, barely legible at first glance, seem to emerge as if from a thick layer of fog, coalescing into a landscape scene, perhaps a mist-enshrouded, tree-lined lakeshore, or maybe even the San Francisco skyline. Qiu achieves this effect by first painting a basic outline of a scene in black or another dark color, often on unprimed canvas, and then obscuring that scene with repeated layers of dilute, semitransparent paint. In refusing to pander to the eye, Qiu forces the viewer to slow down and allow the scene to emerge, thereby putting the viewer into a frame of mind close to meditation, a flow state in which he himself purports to paint: “When I paint, I do not think of structure or theme, what I seek is a certain ‘flavour’—a rhythm of spirit and energy, so that the soul drifts in the painting, like a shadow in the mind. Everything is flat and calm. ‘Form’ is unimportant.” Qiu is deeply interested in Daoist philosophy, which sees the cosmos as a field of interacting opposites—yin and yang, light and dark, solid and void—and his paintings eloquently embody this worldview, denying the viewer knowledge of whether the image is emerging or disappearing. Qiu’s rigorous minimalism, which draws in equal measure on ideas and visual traditions of Europe and China, is a vivid encapsulation of the hybridity and richness of contemporary Chinese painting, in which artists often have a broad range of sources upon which to draw for inspiration."
Dish_with_auspicious_flowers_and_fruits,"Painted enamel wares were made for both domestic and export markets. The patterns on these works were often filled with traditional Chinese symbolism. The fruits and flowers painted on this dish, which allude to different seasons, are auspicious and convey good wishes."
Dish,"This dish illustrates a range of Chinese plants, including peonies, narcissus, and orchids. The presence of differently colored blooms on the same peony branch shows evidence of grafting, a practice that was described in China as early as 1034. Although originally made for a Chinese private commission, such dishes would have appealed to Western traders interested in natural history, who acquired plants from local markets and nurseries. By capturing these flowers in enamel, such a dish might have provided a more secure means of bringing home botanical knowledge."
Bowl_with_auspicious_emblems_(one_of_a_pair),"On the exterior of the bowl, floral scrolls surround four Chinese characters that read “fortune and longevity as you wish” (fu shou ru yi). The interior features a stylized character of longevity encircled by the Eight Buddhist Treasures, symbols that were introduced with Buddhism and are often found in the later decorative arts. Following Chinese tradition, these auspicious signs reveal the bowl was made as a birthday gift. The mark on its base states that it was commissioned by the Hall of Colorful Flowers, likely a study of a scholar official or an upscale family."
Cypress_Tree,"Xu Beihong returned to China from Europe in 1927 and headed the art Department of Liangjiang Normal College in Nanjing, later part of the National Central University. Believing that the reform of Chinese painting required the assimilation of Western methods, Xu strongly criticized the slavish imitation of ancient masters and urged artists to ""adopt the materials and techniques invented to depict real objects.""Cypress Tree resembles a calligraphic performance in its bravura handling of brush and ink, but the attention to light and shade along the trunk and the layered daubs of ink used to suggest foliage reveal Xu's continued commitment to Western-style realism."
Bramble-leaf_Rose,"In literati style, Chen has combined word and image to create a whole greater than the sum of its parts. His subject is the bramble rose with ""thorns like the teeth of a saw"": its image is picked out in staccato brushwork and its qualities are noted in Chen's tight hand. His advice to gardeners is:Growing at the side of the path,They often catch your clothes.Border them with fence and grassAnd you easily pass among them.[Trans. adapted from Ellsworth et al, Later Chinese Painting]"
"Draft_of_""Such_is_the_Beauty_of_Our_Rivers_and_Mountains""","In 1959, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, Fu Baoshi collaborated with Guan Shanyue (1921–2000) on a grand composition for the Great Hall of the People in Tian’anmen Square—Such Is the Beauty of Our Rivers and Mountains. This official commission was a milestone in Fu’s career, a symbolic affirmation of traditional-style Chinese painting that had been criticized in the new China. The painting became the country’s new cultural icon, a national symbol of the time.This scroll is one of Fu’s preliminary drafts for the commission. It is based on Mao Zedong’s poem “Snow,” in which Mao described the magnificence of China’s rivers and mountains. Fu’s pictorial interpretation unites the four seasons and the four corners of the nation in a single composition. The sky is a light red in this draft, offering a contrast to the white snow and anticipating the red sun in the final version."
"Baoshi_Hill_in_the_Ancient_Style,_No._1","Yan Shanchun was raised in Hangzhou, a historically important city that is home to West Lake, one of China’s most famous sites. These ghostly images are based in part on Yan’s memories of West Lake as a child and art student in the 1960s, ’70s, and ’80s. They also engage with Chinese painting history. The artist named each leaf for a different old master painter whose style he evokes in each image, including Dong Qichang (1555–1636) and Gong Xian (1619–1689). Yan’s unusual copperplate printing process involves treating the plates with a mixture of sulfur and olive oil to create recesses for ink. The unpredictable results convey the sense of brush traces—a subtle nod to the ink painting tradition that has inspired Yan."
To_Li_Shuyi:_Poetic_Thoughts_of_Mao_Zedong,"In 1957 Mao Zedong dedicated a poem to Li Shuyi (1901–1997), whose husband was killed fighting the Nationalists in 1933, about the time Mao’s first wife died. The poem, which likens the deceased to a poplar and a willow, imagines their ascent to the moon, where they are welcomed by the Moon Goddess and Wu Gang. The poem concludes with a celebration of the Nationalists’ eventual defeat, bringing forth tears of joy from the heavens.Fu Baoshi’s painting shows the legendary figures greeting the “good souls,” while down on earth red revolutionary flags dot a vast expanse. Flying willow leaves and falling rain fill the space between. The inclusion of Fu’s painting—with its traditional Chinese subject matter and technique—in the 1958–59 Art Exhibition from Socialist Countries in Moscow signaled China’s departure from strict Soviet-style, social-realist orthodoxy during a new era of de-Stalinization."
Bowl_with_auspicious_emblems_(one_of_a_pair),"On the exterior of the bowl, floral scrolls surround four Chinese characters that read “fortune and longevity as you wish” (fu shou ru yi). The interior features a stylized character of longevity encircled by the Eight Buddhist Treasures, symbols that were introduced with Buddhism and are often found in the later decorative arts. Following Chinese tradition, these auspicious signs reveal the bowl was made as a birthday gift. The mark on its base states that it was commissioned by the Hall of Colorful Flowers, likely a study of a scholar official or an upscale family."
Lady_with_flower,"Zhang Daqian spent the years 1941 to 1943 in the remote desert oasis of Dunhuang, where he devoted himself to intensive study of the site’s ancient mural paintings. For Zhang, one of the most striking discoveries in the murals was the depiction of female figures, which had a robustness and solidity very different from the willowy, languid figures of more recent painting. Zhang, who had come to Dunhuang in search of unexplored avenues from history that might help restore the vigor of Chinese painting, was inspired by these figures, which he saw as the antidote to a withering tradition. In the years after his desert sojourn, Zhang expended significant energy painting figures such as this one, which were directly inspired by the murals of Dunhuang."
Pine_Cliff_and_Waterfall,"Liu Haisu studied Western painting in Shanghai, Japan, and Europe, favoring the expressive styles of the Post-Impressionists over the academic realism advocated by Xu Beihong (1895–1953) and the Soviet-inspired Social Realists. In spite of Liu's progressive outlook, his oil painting style, in the coarse, impasto manner of van Gogh, changed little during his long career; his Chinese-style paintings show a similarly vigorous brushwork.This picture reflects Liu's enduring interest in traditional landscape painting, particularly the bold style of the early Qing individualist master Shitao (1642–1707). Like Shitao, Liu sought inspiration directly from nature, particularly the dramatic cliffs and craggy pines of Yellow Mountain. As he proudly proclaims in the legend of one of the seals on this scroll: ""Yellow Mountain is my teacher."" In this monumental image, Liu's dashing brushwork and ink washes are swept up in a single dynamic compositional movement, in which the rearing cliff resembles a cresting wave."
Sounding_Stone,"Sounding stones, usually of jade, which ring clear tones when struck, appear in depictions of Chinese ceremony since the Warring States period (475–221 B.C.). The stones are auspicious, as noted by Qi in his inscription on this painting; when spoken ""jiqing"" can mean both ""auspicious"" and ""beat the sounding stone.""The graphic clarity of Qi's composition, the resonant meanings simply expressed and appealing color are qualities that made Qi's art much sought after, even in wartime Peking."
Lotus,"Zhang Daqian first learned to paint flowers as a child from his mother. This sensuous ink painting is filled with nostalgia for the South and a time of innocence. The poem reads:Moving clouds mingle with the Milky Way.Leaning on the railing and staring at the stars,Do you not remember the enchantment of the South,where children wear red orpiment on their foreheads?[Trans. Ellsworth et al, Later Chinese Painting]Orpiment is an orange pigment worn by children to protect them from disease."
Orchids_and_bamboo,"Inscribed by the artist and by Gu Yuankui (juren degree, 1744); Yinxi (1711–1758); Zhu Wenzhen (1718–ca. 1778); and Cheng Duo (act. early-mid-18th century) Inspired by the viewing of a friend's orchids in full bloom, Zheng Xie painted two plants admired by Chinese literati: the orchid, symbol of loyalty and unappreciated virtue, and the bamboo, symbol of the superior man who is strong yet flexible. Orchids and Bamboo was painted when the artist was fifty, about the time he was appointed to a government post in northern China. Both painting and poem look forward to retirement in the south and celebrate the literati ideal of retreating to nature. The poem, inscribed at the left end of the scroll, is written in a free and elegant style that echoes the brushwork of the orchids beside it.The artist dedicated his painting and poem to his friend Cheng Duo (act. early-mid-18th century), who, in response, inscribed the painting himself and asked three friends to add inscriptions. At the request of a later owner, Huo Rumu (d. 1921), the renowned calligrapher and painter Wu Changshi (1844–1927) inscribed the title sheet with the characters for ""Ink Play"" in archaic seal script. At Huo's invitation, another scholar wrote a long poetic appreciation on a separate sheet of paper attached at the left end of the scroll."
"The_Qianlong_Emperor's_Southern_Inspection_Tour,_Scroll_Six:_Entering_Suzhou_along_the_Grand_Canal","The court painter Xu Yang, a native of Suzhou, was commissioned by the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736–95) to record in twelve monumental handscrolls the emperor's historic 1751 tour of south China. This scroll, the longest of the twelve, chronicles the lavish pageantry of the emperor's arrival in Suzhou.The careful attention to detail offers a rare opportunity to observe the daily life and activities of an eighteenth-century Chinese city. People, residences, shops, famous temples, and renowned scenic gardens and sites reflect the artist's intimate knowledge and love of his hometown. The influence of Western art on court taste is evident in the use of perspective and foreshortening in architectural details. Grand Secretary Yu Minzhong inscribed the beginning of the painting with a poem about Suzhou composed by the Qianlong emperor. Palace archives reveal that Xu Yang began a draft of this set of scrolls in 1764 and completed the silk version in time for the emperor's sixtieth birthday, in 1770.External Digital Content"
Eagle_on_a_pine_tree,"Qi's inscription seems to question the bitter civil strife and foreign aggression in China in the thirties:Why attack ordinary birds,Spraying blood and feathers on the ground?Borrowing lines from Du Fu.[Trans. Ellsworth et al, Later Chinese Painting]The great eagle is inspired by the 17th century individualist Badashanren. Qi relies less on individually inflected brush line than his model and more on strong design. Qi's genius in the use of positive and negative space and the meeting and parting of forms is evident both in the painting and in the beautifully carved seal that follows his inscription. Qi used a distinctive straight cutting style in his seal carving, seldom turning the knife. the resulting strong, rough line shares the aesthetic of calligraphic scripts carved in stone and clay. In this painting, the hand of the artist is as sure in creating the angularity and bold force of the pine branches as in the supple, evenly modulated strokes of the needles."
My_Left_Hand:_Me_(Memories),"Sheng Qi was one of the early pioneers in the body work and performance art movements in China. He fled the country after the suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, for Europe and a period of self-exile. Disgusted with the oppressive cultural atmosphere and the banning of avant-garde activities by the government, he cut off his left pinky in an act of despair and buried it in a flower pot filled with Chinese soil. Although his body would travel abroad, a part of his soul would, thus, still be rooted in China, the country he deeply loved. He spent time in Europe earning a Master's degree from London's St. Martins College of Art and Design and returned to Beijing in 1998.These two works are part of the series called Memories in which he takes old family photos and images from newspaper reports, reduces them in size and shows them in front of his mutilated hand. One is a childhood picture of himself taken during the Cultural Revolution, the other of Mao from the same period. While his damaged hand commemorates the June Fourth Movement, the small black and white photos are rememberances of the past associated with his childhood. They are powerful and disturbing images juxtaposing pain and sadness with idealized pictures from another time."
Rock_and_tree,"Chen Hengke was an influential historian of the literati tradition and a leader among painters and calligraphers in Beijing. He died before he reached fifty, but the many artists who were his friends and students, among them Qi Baishi (1864–1957), advanced his ideals.This painting of a tree and a rock that Chen saw while on a walk is more a product of his imagination than of direct observation, which explains why, according to his inscription, one viewer thought the tree resembled a dragon:There is this strange sight in the Central Park [in Beijing], but tens of thousands of tourists have passed it by, unnoticed. So I decided to paint it. A Buddhist-monk friend of mine asks, ""What does it mean when a dead tree looks like a chanting dragon?"" I have no answer.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 148)"
Preface_to_the_Orchid_Pavilion_Gathering,"Wang Yunwu made significant contributions to publishing, library science, and education reform in twentieth century China. He was also a capable calligrapher, as his transcription of Wang Xizhi's (303–361) ""Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Gathering"" here demonstrates. Revered by calligraphers as the greatest work in running script, this legendary text was composed by Wang on the third day of the third lunar month in 353, when forty-one eminent men of letters gathered at the Orchid Pavilion, a scenic site near Wang's hometown of Shanyin in northern Zhejiang, to perform the customary purification ritual held on that day. During the celebration, all the participants composed poems, and Wang brushed his famous preface. Half inebriated, he created a calligraphic masterpiece so extraordinary that even he could never equal it.Wang Xizhi's ""Preface"" has also been widely admired for its literary finesse and depth of feeling. Lin Yutang translated the entire text in his The Importance of Living (1937), praising it for embodying a very Chinese response to the ""evanescence of life."" Because Wang Yunwu's transcription makes no allusion to Wang Xizhi's style, he presumably shared Lin's appreciation of the philosophic import of the ""Preface."""
Gentlewomen,"According to an inscription on one of the leaves, Hu Xigui painted this set of melancholy images of gentlewomen after classical models, although he does not reveal what those were. Some of the figures are famous from legend or history—the woman in the boat in leaf three is the main character of Bai Juyi’s famous poem “Song of the Lute”—but not all are identified by the artist. Some contemplate fading beauty, while others pine for missing lovers. Although these are well-worn tropes in premodern Chinese paintings of women, Hu’s sensitive brush imbues each figure with a sense of vitality and individual presence that distinguish his renditions."
Family_Tree,"With Family Tree, made less than two years after his move to New York, Zhang offered his face as a surface on which words, names, and stories connected to his cultural heritage are, literally, written. This performance piece is documented in nine photographs that record the gradual obscuring of Zhang’s face with inked words until it is completely blackened. Most words derive from the ancient Chinese art of physiognomy, which seeks to map personality traits and divine the future based on one’s facial features. But rather than elucidating Zhang’s character and fate, these traditional divinatory marks ultimately obscure his identity beneath a dense layer of culturally conditioned references."
Vegetable_#3,"This is an image of the humble Chinese cabbage (bok choy or bai cai) magnified to heroic scale, some six feet tall. The tips of the leaves were painted in broad, gestural lines of wet, black ink that has bled in an uncontrolled manner into the absorbent xuan paper, leaving both the original line and a penumbra of saturation around it. To this, the artist has added wet washes of dark ink that have mottled and pooled irregularly on the surface of the leaves. The white base of the vegetable has been left mostly in reserve, with a moderate amount of light side-brush texturing. The roots of the bok choy, still attached, are rendered in dark washes of ink. The painting has been backed with several layers of xuan paper and mounted to a wooden frame.A tradition of vegetable painting—especially in monochrome ink—dates back at least to the thirteenth century in China. One strain is allegorical, the vegetables standing in for the righteous Confucian scholar beset by petty adversaries. The second has a Chan (J. Zen) Buddhist connotation, the focus on such a mundane subject operating as an emblem of the Buddhist practitioner’s insistence on the centrality of the mundane everyday, in which true enlightenment may be found. Li Jin, who has had a lifelong affinity for Buddhism, seems to be referring to the latter strain, though the formal qualities of the painting show awareness of the former as well. To these connotations, he adds the puckishness of Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen’s sculptures, in which a kind of ironic profundity is achieved through the simple act of magnification."
My_Left_Hand_(Mao),"Sheng Qi was one of the early pioneers in the body work and performance art movements in China. He fled the country after the suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, for Europe and a period of self-exile.

Ten_Thousand_Valleys_in_Deep_Shade,"Huang Binhong was born into a family of scholars and artists in Shexian, Anhui Province. He expressed his anti-Qing sentiments in literati fashion by organizing a local club to honor a seventeenth-century scholar who had defied the corrupt government of his time. When a warrant was issued for his arrest, Huang fled to Shanghai, where he worked as an editor of art books and magazines and gained exposure to the private collections scattered throughout the area. In the 1930s he helped examine the palace collection in Beijing in order to prepare it for dispersal prior to the impending Japanese invasion.This painting, inspired by the brush idiom of the tenth-century monumental landscapist Juran, was executed while Huang was traveling in Sichuan. The dense shade of the trees and flowers covers the many mountains.The shadow of these [mountains, coiled like] dark green snails, oozes into the stream.A few forsaken leaves are turning red and yellow.It is easy for autumn to come to Baidi City because of its altitude.(Robert H. Ellsworth et al., trans., Later Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 1800-1950, 3 vols. [New York: Random House, 1987], vol. 1, p. 150)"
Zhong_Kui_Carrying_a_Sword,"After graduating from college with a degree in history, Fan Zeng studied art history and painting at Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts. He went on to work at the National Museum of Chinese History before becoming chairman of the Oriental Culture Department of Nankai University in Tianjin. As a painter Fan specializes in figural subjects, particularly historical personages, rendered in a dashing style that combines sketchy brushwork with acutely observed naturalistic detail.Zhong Kui, the legendary demon queller, was often portrayed in humorous situations, but Fan Zeng chose to depict him as a heroic figure wearing a sword. Painted about the time that posters advocating greater personal freedom began to appear on ""Democracy Wall"" in Beijing, Fan's bold image may refer to the fall of the Gang of Four and the expunging of other ""demons"" responsible for the chaos of the Cultural Revolution (1966-76).The political sensitivity of Fan's painting is underscored by Huang Miaozi's powerfully brushed but circumspect inscription, which reads, in part:""Earlier artists loved to paint Zhong Kui because the old boy was good for a laugh. . . . After Fan [Zeng] did this painting [of Zhong Kui] holding a sword he asked me what I would inscribe [on it]. I said, 'Only [Zhong Kui] in his gut knows.'"""
Old_Pine_Shrouded_in_Clouds,"Zeng Xi, from Hengyang, Hunan Province, passed the palace (jinshi) examination in 1903. He served in the Qing court until the Revolution of 1911, when he moved to Shanghai. He established himself as a leading calligrapher and painter and became a close friend of Li Ruiqing (1867–1920).Zeng painted this image after Li Ruiqing's death to present to Ruiqing's nephew Li Jian (1881–1956). His dedication reads:An ancient pine tree, having turned into a dragon, displays shining claws in the cloudy firmament. A branch stemming from the same root and luxuriantly green, is auspicious in its burgeoning youth. I painted this as a metaphor for his nephew Li Jian, who has inherited his uncle Ruiqing's [artistic] family legacy. Like the clouds encircling the [pine tree's] roots and branches, the rain and dew will nurture their growth. Jian will pass on what he learned [from Ruiqing] to educate future generations.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 66)"
Response_to_Mi_Fu's_Poem_Written_in_a_Boat_on_the_Wu_River,"Fung Ming Chip is one of the most innovative practitioners of Chinese calligraphy working today. Inspired by but not limited to the classical canon, Fung constantly seeks new ways to invigorate old forms, and he has spent the last two decades creating novel scripts, some of which deliberately defy the dictates of legibility and push close to abstract art.The current work is among Fung’s more traditional, because it takes as its explicit inspiration a classical work of art—Mi Fu’s calligraphy Poem Written in a Boat on the Wu River. Since its gift to the Met by John Crawford in 1984, this has been one of the Museum’s signature works of Chinese art, a masterpiece known to Chinese calligraphy enthusiasts the world over (1984.174). Datable to around 1100, Poem Written in a Boat on the Wu River demonstrates Mi Fu’s epochal achievement in calligraphy, for it shows him riding the line between historically informed elegance and strategic imbalance, a delicate dance that only a calligrapher of Mi’s brilliance could successfully manage. Since the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127), Mi Fu has been a source of both inspiration and intimidation to calligraphers.Faced with the daunting task of responding to such a work, Fung departed somewhat from his more typical working mode, in which he uses the hanging scroll format to create striking, iconic images that are meant to address the viewer from the wall. Following the format of Mi Fu’s piece, Fung wrote his response on a handscroll, creating a more intimate object that is meant to be read on a table, one section at a time. Fung adhered to Mi Fu’s overall lineation and composition, and he took care to make the work more legible than much of his nearly abstract calligraphy, honoring the text of the original. But he also injected his own voice. For instance, he uses a whimsical self-created form for the character meaning “wind” (feng 風), while using archaic forms for other characters, including “five” (wu 五). In one section, Fung highlights the coincidental repetition of characters featuring two visually similar components (jian 見 and mu 目) in Mi’s poem; by foregrounding this repetition, he creates a whimsical and almost childlike space within the scroll.Fung’s voice comes out most strongly in his long inscription at the end of Mi Fu’s poem. Here, Fung departs for the first time from Mi’s compositional structure to lay the characters on the paper according to his own fancy. He clusters the characters on the lower two-thirds of the scroll, building a composition almost like a mountain range out of the words. His meditation on the role of brush-written calligraphy in contemporary life reveals a concern that animates his entire oeuvre."
Letter_to_Nancun,"Wang Chong was a prodigy who died young; his death shocked the scholarly community of Suzhou, especially his mentor Wen Zhengming, who continued to mourn him many years later. Wang writes here in a relaxed semicursive script, which allowed him to lift the brush less frequently than in formal standard script. As a result, many strokes and even characters are connected with fine ligatures. In this brief letter, Wang asks the recipient, a Mr. Nancun, for help with managing a contractor who is doing construction work on his land."
The_Poetic_Mood_of_Su_Shi,"According to the artist's inscription, this painting was done when Li Keran and his students were painting landscapes in Guilin. It shows the great statesman, poet, and artist Su Shi (1036–1101) in a moment of reverie. Su was exiled several times for expressing his political views, but he used these periods for self-cultivation and created some of his most moving poetry and calligraphy. Li captured Su beside a lotus-filled pond. The dark lotus appear almost threatening, as if they are about to engulf the figure, who nevertheless sits quietly, facing the blossoms. The artist's inscription, taken from a poem by Su Shi, reads:Lotus leaves reach up to the sky,endlessly green.In the sun's reflection they turn abrilliant red.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 237)"
Junks,"In 1936 Gao Jianfu accepted a professorship at the National Central University in Nanjing, but with the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war in 1937 he fled with his family to Macao. After the war Gao returned to Canton, where he continued teaching at his own painting studio. During his long absence, however, his style had become less influential and was criticized for having too much ""Japanese flavor."" Following the Communist revolution of 1949, Gao again went to Macao, where he died.Junks, dated October 15, 1945—five days after the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China-presents an introspective image of traditional Chinese fishing boats. The vessels are headed toward a lightening horizon, but their destination—like that of Gao and China itself—is out of sight. With its low horizon line, impressionistic handling of color, and light-suffused atmosphere, the painting reflects Gao's fascination with the representational and coloristic effects of Western painting as well as his faith in an artistic synthesis of Eastern and Western styles."
Buddha_Maitreya_(Mile),"This is the largest early gilt-bronze Chinese sculpture known today. The Buddha’s broad shoulders, powerful physique, and long legs derive from fifth century Indian prototypes that spread to China along the Silk Road, an example of which can be seen directly behind you in the gallery for Indian art.Maitreya is worshiped both as a bodhisattva and as a Buddha, for it is believed that once the current cosmic era has destroyed itself, he will be reborn as the teaching Buddha of the next great era. The identification of this figure as the Buddha Maitreya is based on the dedicatory inscription at the back of the base, which dates the sculpture to 486 and states that it was commissioned in honor of the dowager empress Wenming (442–490), who controlled the Northern Wei dynasty during the last three decades of the fifth century."
Stately_Pines_on_Mount_Hua,"Having openly criticized the Gang of Four in 1969, Shi Lu took refuge in the wilderness near Xi'an. After a year he sought asylum in the hospital where he had been treated earlier for schizophrenia and alcoholism.In the early 1970s his compositions were distilled to a new clarity. His highly individual technique of pushing the brush like a carver's tool became more expressive. He repeatedly found inspiration in China's sacred western peak Mount Hua, whose name is synonymous with the enduring character of both the landscape and the nation. The theme of Shi Lu's poem is noble spirits persevering in the face of adversity:I love the many pines on Mount Hua,Tall, noble, and dignified,Their trunks climbing skyward to compete with the sunand moon.Weathering the bitter winds,Shaking their branches, they reach for the border of heaven.Bestride blue dragons, they hold their heads aloft.Lifting the clouds they stand.Ceaselessly they push against the sky.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], pp. 234-37)"
Man_on_a_Bridge,"Ren Yi, like his contemporary and friend Xugu (1823–1896), experimented with the realistic rendering of natural scenery instead of producing traditional landscapes composed of conventional compositions and brushstroke formulas. Here, he used irregular patches of wash and hatching to convey the impression of naked branches. Ren approached the picture as a Western artist sketching nature might have, asking ""How can I render what I see?"" rather than attempting to imitate Western art.Photographs, regularly published in newspapers and magazines in Shanghai as early as the 1870s, shattered traditional Chinese concepts of picture making and had more to do with changing attitudes in landscape painting in the late nineteenth century than any direct influence of Western art."
Four_Seasons:_Autumn,"Born in the northern province of Jilin and educated at The Art Institute of Jilin as a painter, Hai Bo is one of a group of contemporary Chinese photographers living and working in Beijing and exploring themes of historical, cultural and social change. Unlike many of his contemporaries such as Song Dong and Zhang Huan, Hai Bo is now strictly a photographer, unusual as many artists work in other media such as painting and performance art in addition to photography.In this four-part work made over the course of two years, the artist is seated under a magnificent tree in a park in Changchun, a city in northern China. The tree changes appearence through the seasons, but the figure remains constant, motionless, meditative. Here Hai Bo played as a child, and here his brother accidentally drowned. A palpable sense of loneliness and sorrow pervades the photographs in their forlorn palette, their record of time's passage, and their image of profound contemplation as the artist searches for meaning in nature at a spot marked by the spiritual presence of his lost brother."
Mushrooms,"This delightful scroll is one of several paintings that Zhang Daqian painted for Lin Yutang in the summer of 1965. It features a group of mushrooms depicted in profile or from below. Zhang's humble vantage point elevates this mundane subject to something worthy ofaesthetic appreciation. The sharp blades of grass around the mushrooms indicate that they are growing in the wild. Zhang Daqian's ""ink play"" not only engages the viewer with its spontaneity, but also reveals something very personal. Zhang was a most discriminatingconnoisseur of Chinese cuisine and a chef of the first rank. One of the ingredients that he valued most was mushrooms, as confirmed by his inscription, where he shows off his knowledge of their regional variety:In Nanzhao [Yunnan province] there are jizong [mushrooms]; in the north there are koumo. Those from my homeland are so rich in flavor. Lately my hunger for them is insatiable, but what can I do except build my dreams with songrong [matsutake mushrooms]? The jizong from southern Yunnan and [koumo] from Zhangjiakou [in Hebei province] are two of the best ingredients for cooking. Others, such as the sanpa of Sichuan, the majun of Hunan, the lanhua of West River [in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces], and the songhua of Gaolan [Lanzhou, Gansu province], are also top choices. None of them can be acquired now. Only the songrong mushrooms from Japan can barely match them. In the summer of the yisi year [1965], Yuan.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)"

Untitled,"Primarily known as an oil painter, this bronze sculpture represents a new direction in Zeng’s practice. Untitled evokes the gnarled texture and convoluted form of a blasted tree trunk that continues to send forth new shoots. The twisted and bent “trunk,” scarred with knotholes and cracks, suggests a harsh environment and punishing forces, but the upward reaching “branches” convey a sense of endurance and resilience reminiscent of traditional paintings of ancient plum trees—an abiding symbol of survival, renewal, and moral purity."

Letter_to_Yao_Zhi,"In this letter, Wen Jia thanks his recently departed guest, Yao Zhi, for visiting the day before, and he expresses hope that the subsequent rainstorm did not cause Yao too much trouble. When they met, the two men must have discussed an exchange of art objects, because Wen teasingly continues the negotiations, asking for a little more than previously agreed upon. According to the text of Wen’s letter, it was delivered to Yao by personal messenger dispatched after the visit."
I_am_Chairman_Mao's_Red_Guard,"Born in the nothern province of Jilin and educated at The Art Institute of Jilin as a painter, Hai Bo is one of a group of contemporary Chinese photographers living and working in Beijing and exploring themes of historical, cultural and social change. Unlike many of his contemporaries such as Song Dong and Zhang Huan, Hai Bao is now strictly a photographer, unusual as many artists work in other media such as painting and performance art in addition to photography.This work is similiar– but not part of– Hai Bo's series ""They"", in which he paired photographs taken during the Cultural Revolution with current photographs of the same sitters posed in the same way. Here, a young girl in a Red Guard uniform proudly holding Mao's Little Red Book is paired with a contemporary photograph of the same women in a flowered shift. Already a decade since Hai Bao made the diptych, the contrast between the girl's youthful idealism and the realism of the middle aged woman she has become seems strangely at odds with the transformation of China from the ambition and isolationism of the Cultural Revolution to the market economy and global player it has now become."
Amphora_with_dragon-shaped_handles,"The long neck and rounded body of this amphora reflects a shape found earlier in the Mediterranean region and in west Asia,and produced in both glass and metal. The lively dragon-shaped handles, however, are Chinese additions."
Lotus,"Zhang Daqian's mother taught him to paint flowers when he was a child. At the age of nineteen he left his native Sichuan Province and went to Kyoto to study textile weaving and dyeing. When he returned to China in 1919, he lived in Shanghai and Suzhou, where he immersed himself in the study of traditional painting. Between 1940 and 1943 he studied, catalogued, and made copies of the brilliantly colored wall paintings of the Buddhist cave temples, mostly fifth to tenth century, in the western oasis of Dunhuang.This painting epitomizes Zhang's ability to synthesize diverse stylistic sources. The bold ink-wash lotus leaves reveal his early fascination with the expressive style of Bada Shanren (1626–1705); the descriptive treatment of the blossoms and water plants reflects his mastery of academic bird-and-flower painting; the vivid palette and ink washes suffused with blurry highlights of red and green reveal his familiarity with the Japanese artists of the Nihonga school. Zhang's inscription suggests that he was inspired by the visions of paradise at Dunhuang. Stylistically, however, this image has nothing to do with early models; instead, its sumptuous style comes closest to the decorative imagery of modern Japanese flower paintings:Blue, yellow, red, and white express [Buddha's] infinite benevolence.I offer these lotuses as Buddha's manifestation of joyfulness.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H.

"They_No._7,_Three_Sisters","Born in the northern province of Jilin and educated at The Art Institute of Jilin as a painter, Hai Bo is one of a group of contemporary Chinese photographers living and working in Beijing and exploring themes of historical, cultural and social change. Unlike many of his contemporaries such as Song Dong and Zhang Huan, Hai Bo is now strictly a photographer, unusual as many artists work in other media such as painting and performance art in addition to photography.Hai Bo's series ""They"" from the 1990s and 2000s consists of eleven paired photographs in which he rephotographed snapshots of family and friends taken during the Cultural Revolution and then reassembled the same people in identical poses for a new photograph. The two pictures side by side show the physical trace of time, the loss of ""revolutionary idealism,"" and in some instances, the absence of former friends and relatives.In this work, They No. 7, Three Sisters, Hai Bo has paired a formal black and white portrait of three young women taken in the 1970s with a contemporary version, in which one of the women is missing. The juxtaposition of the two portraits forces one to contemplate the changes that have taken place in people and society, and the more general themes of time, memory, and mortality."

Vase_in_Shape_of_Ancient_Bronze_Vessel,"The square handles and ring illustrate the metal origins of the shape of the vase. Similar examples have been excavated in Chinese tombs dating to the fifteenth and sixteenth century, suggesting that the shape was particularly popular at that time."
Seventeen_Letters,"This handscroll consists of seventeen letters written by Xu Beihong between 1938 and 1948. The first fifteen were written to Lin Yutang, and the last two to Lin's daughter Taiyi. The letters remained separate sheets until the 1980s, when Lin Taiyi had them remounted chronologically as a handscroll.The letters exemplify Xu Beihong's distinct calligraphic style, which is angular and tense with no concern for charm. More importantly, they document early attempts at cultural exchange between China and the United States, as Xu enlisted Lin Yutang's assistance in organizing a touring exhibition of contemporary Chinese art in America to gain support for China during the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45).Xu Beihong may have come up with this ambitious plan with Lin Yutang in mind. Lin moved to New York in 1936. After the publication of two widely acclaimed best sellers, by 1938 Lin's influence and connections had made him China's unofficial cultural ambassador. In addition, he was an outspoken critic of Japanese militarism. Xu also suggested that Lin Yutang involve his close friends Pearl Buck (1892–1973) and her husband Richard Walsh in planning the proposed exhibition. The majority of the letters chronicle in detail Xu's preparations for his trip to the U.S. Plans were finalized for him to leave Singapore for San Francisco on December 6, 1941. Unfortunately, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the next day caused the entire project to be aborted."
Poem,"清 高鳳翰 書畫卷Partial paralysis forced Gao Fenghan to switch midcareer from writing with his right hand to his left hand. While the right-handed work of his youth is elegant and somewhat conservative, his mature left-handed work, as seen here, is free and bold, full of unconventional character structures and wavering lines. Eighteenth-century Yangzhou was highly tolerant of eccentricity, and Gao’s late work was well received there. Gao was also a painter, and, on this scroll, the combination of word and image is a powerful statement of the close relationship between these two arts in Chinese culture."

The_Immortal_Liu_Haichan_Playing_with_a_Toad,"Born to impoverished and illiterate parents in Jiangsu Province, Li Keran began studying painting at the age of thirteen. In the 1920s he studied both traditional and Western-style art with Liu Haisu (1896–1994) and Lin Fengmian (1900–1991). In 1946 Xu Beihong (1895–1953) recommended Li for a post at the Beijing National Art College, where faculty members Qi Baishi (1864–1957) and Huang Binhong (1865–1955) encouraged him to pursue traditional painting.This work is an early example of Li's interest in ancient Chinese figure painting. It depicts Liu Haichan (""Liu Sea Toad""), a minister during the tumultuous Five Dynasties era (906–960) who renounced his titles and became a recluse. By Ming times Liu was venerated as an immortal and was always depicted unkempt, unshod, and carrying a three-legged toad.This bold image reflects Li's familiarity with popular New Year's prints and woodblock images as well as with the uninhibited brushwork and spontaneous inkwash style of Liang Kai (act. ca. 1200–1250), a member of the Song Imperial Painting Academy who relinquished his position to become a Chan (Zen) Buddhist monk."
Jietai_Temple,"Trained in traditional-style landscape painting, Lu Yanshao found no place for his elitist art after the Communist Liberation in 1949 and was forced to work in a government shop in Shanghai that made cartoons and comic strips. Labeled a rightist during the Cultural Revolution, Lu was denied the right to paint from 1968 to 1978.This painting was done the year that the charges against Lu were revoked. Recording the pleasures of travel, it celebrates the strangely contorted ever-greens growing around two of the scenic temples near Beijing. The animated trees, unrestrained by the walled courtyard, reach beyond the confines of the temple precinct to interact with their counter-parts in the landscape beyond. The artist's inscription reads:In the spring of 1978, I was in the capital and traveled to the temples Tanzhe and Jietai. Ancient pines and junipers rose in a strange and archaic manner, something I had never seen before. After I returned to the south, comrade Chen Yi asked about the sights in the capital, so I painted this to win his smile.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 254)"
Draft_poem_for_seeing_off_Lin_Jun_(1452–1527),"Wen Peng was the son of Wen Zhengming, the leading cultural figure in Suzhou during the mid-Ming dynasty. Growing up in a home of wealth and discernment, Wen Peng was privileged to learn calligraphy and painting from the best teachers and to study directly from ancient masterworks in his father’s collection. This is a draft of a poem that Wen Peng wrote for one of his father’s friends; here, he has written it out for another person, identified by the nickname Sizhi, in the hopes of receiving helpful feedback on the composition."
Flowers,"Painted late in Huang Binhong's long life, this album reflects his mastery of traditional Chinese flower painting. In each leaf, Huang explores a different flower as well as different styles of painting them-from the outline style of his tree peony, to the ""boneless"" method (using washes with no defining contour strokes) of his herbaceous peonies. The last leaf—a hibiscus—shows a combination of line and wash that epitomizes his style. In spite of the coloristic opportunities afforded by an album of flowers, Huang's use of the same few colors over and over demonstrates that his principal concern was not representational or decorative but was the stylistic language of the genre."
Winter_Journey_in_the_North,"Even Zhu Yunming, one of the most versatile calligraphers of the Ming dynasty, found the shape and structure of the folding fan a challenge. He described writing on it ""like asking a dancing girl to demonstrate her technique on a pile of broken bricks and tiles."" This fan bears neither signature nor seal, yet the writing is distinctly Zhu's. The characters are densely packed without clearly distinguished columns, adding a pictorial dimension to the writing. Zhu successfully adopted the cursive styles of Huaisu (725–785) and Huang Tingjian (1045–1105) to the folding-fan form."
Discourse_on_Poetry,"Gardens were often designed to embody the ideals of their owners. Paintings of gardens could take even greater license in conveying a man’s character by constructing symbols and metaphors drawn from elements of the natural environment. That is surely the case with this painting by the Suzhou artist Gao Jian.The painting was made to accompany a treatise on Chinese poetry by the renowned scholar-official and collector Song Luo (1634–1713). In it, Gao presents an idealized evocation of Song composing his discourse in a garden pavilion. Rejecting bright color and representational verisimilitude, Gao renders his simplified, almost naive vision of the garden in a spare, “dry brush” monochrome style that emphasizes the painting’s role as a “portrait” rather than a literal description of the scholar’s surroundings. The majestic pines, dense grove of bamboo, and tranquil lotus pond may all be read as metaphors for Song’s lofty character, moral virtue, and detached state of mind.The sparse foreground and meticulous brushwork exemplify the Suzhou School of painting, from which Gao derived his style. Framed by a bold seal-script frontispiece and Song’s treatise, transcribed in formal standard-script calligraphy by Song’s son, the scroll unites poetry, painting, and calligraphy in a quintessential work of early Qing literati culture."
Narcissus,"Zhao Mengjian, a member of the Song imperial family and an accomplished scholar and calligrapher, specialized in painting narcissi and raised the flower to the level of the orchid in the esteem of scholars. Offering the promise of spring, the narcissus is known in Chinese as the ""water goddess"" (shuixian) or the ""goddess who stands above the waves"" (lingbo xianzi). The fragrant blossoms are associated with the two goddesses of the Xiang River and, by extension, with Qu Yuan (343–277 b.c.), author of Li Sao (On Encountering Sorrow). Qu Yuan, a loyal minister of the state of Chu, drowned himself in a tributary of the Xiang River after failing to alert his prince of the imminent danger threatening the state.In a poem appended to the scroll after the Mongol conquest, the Song loyalist Qiu Yuan (1247–after 1327) describes Zhao's narcissi as the only vision of life in an otherwise devastated land:The shiny bronze dish is upset,and the immortals' dew spilled;The bright jade cup is smashed,like broken coral.I pity the narcissus for not beingthe orchid.Which at least had known thesober minister from Chu."
Portrait_of_the_wife_of_Yizhai,"This image of an elegant elderly lady shows how the Chinese portrait painter conveyed a sense of status through a figure's accoutrements. The lady's wealth is suggested by her jewelry (gold-and-pearl earrings and an ornate headdress fashioned out of gold and kingfisher feathers), by her sumptuous outer robe of blue brocade and white underrobe fastened at the neck by gold clasps, and by the red-and-gold brocaded cloth draped over the back of her chair. Her family status is further underscored by the official belt inset with elaborately worked plaques and the large rank badge with Manchurian cranes—the insignia of a civil official of the highest rank. Since women were not eligible to hold government office, these marks of rank were probably inherited from her father."
Peach_Blossoms_and_Peony,"The preeminent literati artist of his day, Zhao Zhiqian applied his skills as a calligrapher and seal carver to the art of painting. His blending of contrasting compositional and graphic effects—positive forms and negative spaces, dry and wet ink, round and angular movements, heavy and light brushwork—derive from his calligraphic training; for this reason, Zhao's painting style, often referred to as ""epigraphic,"" inaugurated a new direction for traditional Chinese artists.The relationship of figure to ground, which is at the heart of seal carving, is seen here in Zhao's bold juxtaposition of the solidly colored peach blossoms and the monochrome peony, which are executed in the two traditional modes of flower painting: the ""boneless"" method of drawing in color without ink contours and the monochrome outline method. The pinwheel effect of Zhao's swirling cluster of blossoms is held in check by his compact inscription, which counterbalances the expansive leftward thrust of the peony. Zhao states that he is following the brush style of Wang Wu (1632–1690), but his mix of lush imagery and calligraphic techniques is quintessentially nineteenth century."
The_Classic_of_Filial_Piety,"Song scholar-artists believed that painting was not just a record of sensory experience but also a reflection of the artist's mind, a revelation of his personality, and an expression of deeply held values. In giving form to this ideal, Li Gonglin fundamentally transformed Chinese art. Prior to Li's time, painting served a public function: it was primarily decorative or didactic in intent. With Li, painting joined music, poetry, and calligraphy as a medium of self-expression. Li's revolutionary new style established the three essential desiderata of scholar-painting: moral purpose, learned stylistic references to the past, and expressive calligraphic brushwork.The Classic of Filial Piety, composed between 350 and 200 B.C., teaches a simple but all-embracing lesson: beginning humbly at home, filial piety not only ensures success in a man's life but also brings peace and harmony to the world at large. During the Song dynasty, the text became one of the thirteen classics of the Neo-Confucian canon and remained a cornerstone of traditional Chinese moral teaching until modern times.Purposefully restrained and without the decorative appeal of color, Li's paintings alternate with his transcriptions of brief chapters from the Classic. The images do more than illustrate the text; using his art to criticize, exhort, and subvert, Li presents subtle commentaries on the Classic's moral relevance to the Song world. Like the paintings, the calligraphy is executed in an archaic style instantly recognizable to the connoisseur as a sophisticated plea for a return to simple virtues and plain-living rectitude."
Flower_and_Bird,"Zhang Xiong was a well established artist in Shanghai in the third quarter of the 19th century, and Ren Bonian, among others, sought him out as a teacher. when Wu Changshi first came to Shanghai he shared a room with Zhang ""large enough to hold only two beds and a table to paint on.""Zhang had a literati training in calligraphy, poetry and painting. He is best known for works like this one in the refined style of the early Qing bird-and-flower master Yün Shouping. Here Zhang takes delight in the cool elegance of autumn:Such a nostalgic autumn view!Nature's colors, more beautiful than spring.A bird smiles at featherlike leaves.I am moved to paint this for a young friend.[Trans. adapted from Ellsworth et al., Later Chinese Painting]"
Night-blooming_Cereus,"Wu Hufan's delicate sensibilities in the literati manner are evident in this collaborative effort among two calligraphers and the painter. The cereus, a species of cactus that flowers only briefly is used as a metaphor for intense loveliness savored with the knowledge that it will not endure.The poet renders a botanically accurate description of the sweet-scented flower:The flower blooms from the tip of the leaf.Its purple armor is covered by the rosy clouds of dawn.The yellow stamen sits in a jade bowl,And its hair-like curly petals are uneven.[Trans. Ellsworth et al, Later Chinese Painting]"
Welcoming_spring,"In Chinese, both goats and sheep are called yang 羊, which sounds like the word for “sun” (yang 陽). Three goats together, a motif repeated three times here, thus evokes the phrase “three suns welcome spring” (sanyang kaitai 三陽開泰), a wish for an auspicious new year taken from the ancient Book of Change (Yi Jing)."
Narcissus,"Always something of an adventurer and an outsider, Chang Daqian claimed to have lived as a captive to bandits. He also trained in Japan in textile weaving and dyeing. He spent 1919 and 1920 in the studio of Li Ruiqing and Zeng Xi. This period broadened Zhang's exposure to fine paintings. By the 1930s he was making his name as an artist in Shanghai.In this fan painting dedicated to Chen Sanyuan, the father of the painter, historian and mentor Chen Hengke, Zhang Daqian uses ranging narcissus stems to symbolize the collapse of traditional social structures during this period of civil strife and impending Japanese invasion. The poem reads:It is said there were red narcissus in theTang Palace.This yellow one I did looks rather pitiful.the socks that bind the family have disintegrated.A thousand tendrils have broken throughTheir web and are growing haphazardlyin the water.[Trans. Ellsworth et al, Later Chinese Painting]"
Orchid_and_Rock,"This fine painting represents the triumph of modern Chinese painting over both the deadwood of orthodoxy and infatuations with the exotic that would have severed it from its cultural roots. The artist's painting, calligraphy and seal are individual, fresh and nourished by tradition. Shi Lu took the surname Shi because of his admiration for Shitao, the 17th century monk-painter whose style is invoked in the orchid and rock. The calligraphy of Shi Lu's signature, with its display of resistance as brush, paper and the artist's will engage, sums up the fascination among 19th and 20th century intellectuals for carved scripts. The complete circle from seals to carved scripts to painting that transpired in the 19th and 20th centuries is reenacted in his highly graphic seal, which is not an impression, but a painted image."
Pillow_with_boy_on_hobbyhorse,"Hobbyhorses appear in Chinese painting and decorative arts as early as the twelfth century. It is possible that this popular children’s toy, which is also sometimes cited as the precursor of the bicycle, was invented in China and spread from there to the Western world."
Poem_on_retirement,"A lover of martial arts as well as an accomplished poet, Song Ke briefly pursued a military career before returning to his native Suzhou, where he lived in retirement from about 1356 until the first Ming emperor (r. 1368–98) summoned him to serve as calligrapher-in-waiting at court. The foremost calligrapher of the early Ming, Song Ke based both his cursive and his regular scripts on those of Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322). This scroll probably dates to near the end of the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). It is executed in sharp, incisive thrusts and powerful curves that evoke Song's martial spirit, and its mixture of cursive and draft-cursive styles recalls the writing of two of Zhao Mengfu's early followers: Kangli Naonao (1295–1345) and Rao Jie (ca. 1300–1367)."
Cloudy_Mountains,"Liu Haisu, whose father had joined the Taiping rebellion, came from a family with progressive views. Liu studied painting with the leading intellectuals Wu Changshuo and Chen Hengke and learned calligraphy from the revolutionary Kang Yuwei. Liu opened the first public art school in Shanghai in 1912 and became a champion of the New Art Movement there.He traveled in Japan and Europe, lecturing, mounting exhibitions, studying Western works and developing the oil painting techniques he had first attempted at the age of fourteen in China. In the 1930s, he turned to traditional Chinese media as did many artists, but he has continued to paint in oils as well over his long career.This fan painting is an example of Liu's enduring interest in the landscapes of South China, here rendered in traditional medium and style. Only the strongly contrasting areas of light and dark show his experimentation with Western ideas and techniques."
Snake_Catching_A_Frog,"Gao Jianfu grew up in Canton (Guangdong) in the climate of Kang Yuwei's call for progressive political reforms. As a youth Gao joined the Revolutionary Alliance, which later emerged under the leadership of another Cantonese, Sun Yat-sen, as the Guomingtang.After the fall of the dynasty, Gao took the path of many reformers and pursued the ""modern"" and the ""Western"" in Japan. He studied at the Tokyo Academy of Fine Arts and traveled to India. When he returned to China in 1916, he inculcated students with his ideas of a ""new national painting"" using Western modeling techniques and departing from the traditional idealized subjects of Chinese painting.This strikingly modern painting embodies an important feature of the Lingnan School in the surprising choice of subject matter."
Par_nirvana_(death_and_transcendence_of_the_Buddha)_and_attendant_arhats,"This is a depiction of the Buddha’s nirvana. His attendants are all in deep sorrow: one wipes away a tear, while others seem to be crying out or, alternatively, at a loss for words. The Buddha, however, is shown in a state of near sleep, indicating a heavenly wisdom.According to the inscription on the back and sides of the couch on which the Buddha reclines, a monk had these sculptures made in 1503 as a private act of devotion. They were originally part of a larger group of figures from the Qiao family workshop in Yangcheng, Shanxi Province."
Sitting_on_the_Wall:_Haikou_V,"For Weng Fen, a schoolgirl serves as the avatar for a country in the throes of physical, social, economic, and political change—a collective self-portrait of China, and of the modern world. ""These young girls are the mirrors of us,"" said Weng in a 2015 interview, before rising nationalism and a withdrawal from openness to the world took hold. ""The distant cities are the by-products of modernization’s dream; in the eyes of people they represent civilization and modern progress. The city has become the religion of today. By calmly observing this ‘hyper-progress,’ I can then understand that men’s desires are the basis for social problems. The girls embody these desires, these needs. Through them, we are at the same time excited, puzzled, waiting."""
Various_Subjects,"Born into a family of physicians in Songjiang, near Shanghai, Cheng Shifa began studying traditional painting at Shanghai Art College in 1938. After the liberation he became a successful illustrator of children's books and taught at the Shanghai Chinese Painting Academy, where he developed an eclectic style that combined traditional brushwork with Western drawing techniques using a pen.Cheng is best known for his figural subjects, but this album, entitled In Search of the Delightful, shows off his broad command of subjects and techniques. A number of the leaves openly celebrate the 1976 downfall of Jiang Qing, Mao Zedong's notorious wife and leader of the Gang of Four, which strictly controlled culture. The Monkey-King Beats the White-Boned Demon depicts the beloved hero of the epic Journey to the West and intrepid defender of the faithful attacking the White-Boned Demon, to whom Jiang Qing was often compared."
Quatrain_by_Meng_Haoran,"Like most imperial calligraphies, this fan is not signed or dated, but its distinctive writing style— the same as that of the couplet mounted together with Ma Lin's Landscape at Sunset (Nezu Museum, Tokyo) and dated 1254—clearly identifies it as a work by Lizong. The round seal showing the trigram qian (""Heaven""), used only by the emperor, confirms its imperial pedigree. The poem, though composed by Meng Haoran (689–740), perfectly describes the kind of atmospheric qualities that thirteenth-century painters, such as Ma Lin and Liang Kai, sought to evoke pictorially:In the Chan meditation hall, on the mountaintop, hangs a priest's robe.There is no one outside the window, only birds flying by a stream.As dusk half envelops the mountain path,I hear the bells toll over the endless greenery.(Wen C. Fong, trans., in Beyond Representation: Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 8th–14th Century [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1992], p. 239)"
Letter,"A native of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, Jiao Hong was a prolific scholar, noted bibliophile, and important calligrapher who passed the civil service examination in 1589 with the highest honors and was appointed to a succession of official positions before resigning and returning home in 1599.In this letter, Jiao acknowledges a request for his calligraphy relayed by Minister of Rites Huang Ruliang (1554–1647). The request entailed inscribing a panel with four large characters, “Famous Practitioner of the Medical Arts,” for someone to present to a certain Dr. Li as an expression of gratitude for his services."
Insects_and_Flowers,"In his later years Huang Binhong turned increasingly to flower painting. He painted this album when he was eighty-four, the year he moved from Beijing to Hangzhou to take a position at the Hangzhou Academy of Art. The album is executed with rough, abstract brushwork, with no regard for superficial dexterity or naturalistic representation. On the last leaf Huang observed:The ancients often remarked that in painting it is better to be clumsy than clever. Some may even say that the clever can also be clumsy, because to understand that cleverness can lead to stupidity is to be close to the ways of Heaven.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 178)"
Playing_weiqi_in_a_waterside_pavilion,"Between 1933 and 1935 Fu Baoshi studied painting in Japan, where he developed notions of a new national painting style based on a fusion of Western realism and traditional brushwork. After his return to China, Fu taught at the National Central University in Nanjing.This large painting was done between 1940 and 1946, when Fu lived in Sichuan. The garden pavilion buttressed by powerful rocks next to a rushing stream may refer to Fu's personal retreat as identified in his inscription: ""The Mountain Studio at the foot of Mount Jin'gang in Eastern Sichuan."" It may also be understood as a metaphor for China's enduring culture. The two scholars at weiqi (go, in Japanese) recall the four traditional accomplishments of the gentleman—weiqi, playing the zither, calligraphy, and painting—but they may also allude to China's history of military strategy.The composition, framed top and bottom by forms rendered in saturated daubs of black ink, presents a shallow space packed with richly colored garden elements. Only the freestanding screen in the pavilion remains unpainted, serving as a bold accent that throws the figures into high relief, accentuating the stagelike drama. Fu's combination of Chinese and foreign painting methods is evident in his treatment of the stream, which is delineated with dry-brush contours and alternating passages of wash and uninked paper that suggest the play of sunlight across the surface-a treatment borrowed from Western watercolor techniques."
Fish,"Bada Shanren harbored strong loyalist sentiments well into his old age and often used painting to express his defiant spirit. The fish in this painting is typical of his bold, enigmatic images. Its upturned eye creates a vivid impression of indignation that is almost human. Seemingly suspended in midair with its tail half cropped, the fish may symbolize the displacement and bereavement of all native Chinese. With its menacing stare and a bulging belly, the fish compares most closely with similar images created in the early 1690s."
"""Lao_ru_linmu_qi_guo_si""","The archaic script of this seal derives from pre-Han examples. The meaning of the sentence is obscure. It may be interpreted as: ""Four faults in entering the woods in old age."""
Letter,"This letter, written in Wang Duo's middle age, shows him still practicing the model style of Wang Xizhi (303–361). Wang's brush moves at different speeds, often slowing down to change direction and giving his well-articulated characters a sense of restrained energy that also recalls the writing of Mi Fu (1052–1107). The text describes Wang's impressions of an opera to a friend who was a composer."
Snow_over_the_Waterside_Village,"In the post-Mao era the landscape of Zhejiang Province became a major theme for printmakers attempting to recover traditional culture by asserting local identity. Wu Jide, a major exponent of this movement, produced a set of twenty-two prints of carefully observed local scenes and customs for a children’s book entitled Plum Rain, published in 1989. This print from the set demonstrates Wu’s special technique of block printing opaque colors on a dark ground to achieve textural variety and chromatic luminosity."
Poem_in_Cursive_Script,"Kuang Lu wrote this poem to commemorate an outing to the mountains with four friends on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month—the Double Ninth Festival. On this day custom dictates that people ascend the heights to enjoy the view. Apart from vivid descriptions of natural scenery and musing over the passage of time, he mentions the no-longer-occupied Weiyuan Constellation, the realm of the Jade Emperor. This allusion to the demise of the Ming emperor dates this calligraphy to the final years of Kuang’s life.Written in wild-cursive script, this work pushes the graphic potential of Chinese characters to the utmost. Twisting ink filaments link separate strokes and adjacent characters in dynamic configurations. Columnar integrity is willfully and creatively compromised to draw attention to the pictorial quality of this linear composition as a masterpiece of abstract art.cat. no. 33"
Rain_on_Laurel_Blossoms,Xu Lin was a scholar-artist whose diverse talents ranged from painting to playwriting to calligraphy. This fan preserves his transcription of an ode to the beauty of rain-laden laurel flowers by the poet Chen Yuyi (1091–1138).
Ten_Kings_of_Hell,"This is one from a set of scrolls (30.76.290–.294) illustrating the theme of the Ten Kings of Hell, which developed during the second half of the Tang dynasty (618–907). The theme transforms the Indian Buddhist view of judgment after death into a typically Chinese bureaucratic process. Before being permitted to transmigrate into the next life, a soul is tried by a different king each week for seven weeks; it is sent to the eighth king on the hundredth day, to the ninth after a year, and to the tenth the third year after death. Here, each scroll shows a king—assisted by a scribe and other officials—examining and passing sentence on the souls of the dead; in the foreground demons punish the wicked..Most extant Song and Yuan dynasty Buddhist paintings were preserved in Japan; many had been taken there from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, an important port city for Japanese merchants and pilgrims. Inscriptions on the present paintings state that they were made in the studio of Jin Chushi, a Buddhist layman in Mingzhou, the name for Ningbo before it was changed to Qingyuanfu in 1195; the paintings, therefore, must date prior to that year. Stylistically, they are extremely close to The Five Hundred Luohans in the Zen Buddhist temple Daitokuji, Kyoto, which were also made in Ningbo and are dated 1178. The vivid drawing and the intense colors of these works are typical of the best Buddhist narrative paintings of the period."
Letter_to_Xu_Shangde,"Not only is this letter one of the most beautiful specimens of Tang Yin's calligraphy to survive, but its contents also provide invaluable information about Tang's wide-ranging literary productions, many of which are no longer extant. The text of Tang's letter reads in part:I am getting together my past writings so I might be remembered after my death. I hope that all my writings—the three volumes of the Sanshi huqian [on the principles of fortune telling], eight volumes of Selected Literary Works, one volume of The Mirror of Painting and Calligraphy, twenty volumes of Biographies of Generals and Ministers, two volumes of Historical Discussions, and six volumes of Discussions of Current Affairs—will be remembered by you. Some day . . . I hope you will write of these works on my tombstone.(Marc F. Wilson and Kwan S. Wong, trans., Friends of Wen Cheng-ming: A View from the Crawford Collection [New York: China Institutein America, 1974], p. 74)"
Calligraphy_after_ancient_masters,"明 董其昌 行書臨古帖 卷 紙本This handscroll has five distinct pieces of writing, each in the manner of a different old master. Studying the past plays a central role in Chinese calligraphy and even as one develops a personal style, it is necessary to revisit the old masters to discover new insights. By the time he wrote these passages—the first two around 1595 and the remaining three around 1600—Dong Qichang had developed a unique style, and the work shows both his individual voice and his knowledge of calligraphic tradition."
Digital_No._02HP01–03,"In Wang’s Digital series, each panel consists of two sheets of paper layered one atop the other: the bottom sheet is inscribed with columns of random Chinese characters in ink, while the translucent paper on top is burned with random characters written with a cigarette or incense stick. Wang developed this method of “writing” after he accidentally dropped ash onto paper while lighting a cigarette in his studio and observed the resulting perforations. For him, the process resembles that of “burning” information onto digital drives—hence the title of the series. Wang’s layering of ink and paper obscures the individual characters, yet the vivid physical traces of the artist’s hand assert the primacy of the creative process and the object’s materiality, reminding us that much of Chinese culture is preserved through a medium that is inherently fragile and vulnerable, and that our grasp of past traditions is similarly elusive."
After_Three_Rubbings,"Yun Shouping's normal writing style derives from the Tang master Chu Suiliang (596–658). In this fan, however, Yun copied texts by three other early masters preserved in stone rubbings. From right to left the texts are: Classic of the Yellow Court, attributed to Wang Xizhi (303?–361?); Xuanjing bei by Zhang Sizhi (dates unknown); and the Zhengzuo tie by Yan Zhenqing (709–785). In each case, Yun's graceful hand softens the distinguishing marks of the originals; the writing is naturally his own."
Letter,"A child prodigy, Wang Zhideng could do large character calligraphy at the age of six and compose poetry at ten. Best known for his monumental clerical or seal-script frontispieces for handscrolls, he wrote this letter to a friend in the more informal running-cursive script. In the letter, Wang relates that he has fulfilled the friend's request for a colophon to enhance the appeal of a certain scroll and, in addition, was presenting him with a gift of six carp to help him recover from illness. Wang's affection for his friend is underscored by the fact that he wrote this letter in the freezing cold on a snowy day when he was ill himself.Wang, who spent most of his life in Suzhou, here follows the calligraphic style of Wen Zhengming (1470–1559), the influential leader of Suzhou's artistic circle of two generations earlier. Wang's characters are tall and slightly pinched. Lacking the strength and bold rhythmic gestures of his model, his brushwork nonetheless impresses the viewer with its graceful ease and natural finesse as evident in the gentle fluctuations of the individual strokes. In addition to the speed and casualness of the writing, Wang's illness may also explain certain cursoriness in its execution."
Yang_Guifei_with_a_Parrot,"Zhang Daqian's facility as a figure painter, improved by years of studying early scroll paintings and the murals at Dunhuang, is demonstrated in this depiction of the infamous consort of the eighth-century Tang emperor Xuanzong. The portrayal is an eclectic mix of sources and styles. Yang Guifei's elaborate coiffure recalls Tang models; her costume and the animated brushwork that defines her fluttering scarves and swirling hem derive from sixteenth-century prototypes; and her coquettish expression and theatrical pose recall cinematic images of contemporary beauties.Zhang's lithe brushwork and facile rendering of Yang Guifei's complex stance infuse her figure with immediacy and drama. Her relationship with her pet is emphasized by their eye contact and by the juxtaposition of the parrot with the phoenix ornamenting her coiffure. Zhang's inscription elucidates their conspiratorial connection:During the Tianbao era [742–55], the provincial governor of Lingnan presented the emperor with a white parrot of exceptional intelligence, which the emperor and [his consort] Yang Guifei named Girl in a Dress of Snow. The emperor often played dice with his concubines and princes. When the emperor was winning, everyone would cheer and the parrot would fly into the middle of the game to break it up.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 203)"
Knickknack_peddler,"The image of a traveling salesman laden with wares was popular in premodern Chinese figure painting. While some examples show an elegant environment that suggests some kind of costume play in a palace, this is a more rustic scene, in which both the knickknack peddler and the mother wear humble, rumpled clothes. One can sense the anticipation among the four young children as they clamor for toys and snacks."
Portrait_of_a_man_in_court_robes_with_fur_surcoat,"This portrait depicts a middle-aged man in court robes topped by a sumptuous fur coat. Building on both Chinese and European precedents, the artist shaded the face to suggest three-dimensional volume; the glistening white dot in the eye, suggesting moistness, is a purely European convention adopted by the artist during a time when images from abroad were becoming more widely available in China. The man sits before a screen painted with a floral rebus, or multipart visual pun: magnolia (yulan 玉蘭), crab apple (haitang 海棠), and peony (nicknamed fugui 富貴) combine to mean “fortune in the jade hall” (yutang fugui 玉堂富貴), a wish for riches and honor. With such an auspicious background, this portrait was likely made for a milestone birthday; after the death of the sitter, it could have been repurposed for veneration in the ancestral shrine."
Liu_Chen_and_Ruan_Zhao_Entering_the_Tiantai_Mountains,"Painted by a member of the Song royal family who lived through the Mongol conquest, this handscroll, which revives the monochrome drawing style of the scholar-artist Li Gonglin (ca. 1041–1106), chronicles the legend of two men of the Han dynasty who stumble upon a magical realm of immortals. Returning home after what seemed like half a year, they discover that seven generations have come and gone and that they are alone in the world. The men’s loss of home and paradise evokes the disorientation and alienation felt by many of the Chinese elite following the fall of the Song dynasty in 1279.What little we know of the artist is contained in the colophons mounted after the painting. The first, by Hua Youwu (1307–after 1386), describes Zhao Cangyun as an artist known for “boneless” (without outlines) ink-wash landscapes and delicate figure paintings. Hua also states that the artist was more famous in his youth than his fellow clansmen Zhao Mengjian (1199–before 1267) and Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322). As Zhao Cangyun withdrew to the mountains and lived as a recluse, never marrying or serving as an official, no documentation, except this scroll, survives."
Flowers_and_Fruits,"In this set of auspicious flowers and fruits which might hang together in a prominent place, such as a reception hall, or alternate according to the season, Jin Cheng achieves with expressive ink and flashes of bright color the tastefully decorative effects sought after by patrons of the period.LycheeThe crystal ball is wrapped in a sack of crimson yarn.Occasionally I work in Tao-chi's style.Day LillyThe grasses make one's worries disappearand the stone symbolizes long life.Wishing you eternal happiness.GrapesThe vine wriggles like a flying dragon.Clusters of pearls by the hundred drop from hischin.[Trans. from Ellsworth et al., Later Chinese Painting]"
Giraffe_with_Two_Keepers,"In 1414, a giraffe—a creature unknown in China at the time—was presented to the Yongle emperor (r. 1403–24) from the king of Bengal, which was a major trading center on the maritime route between the Arabian Peninsula and China. The Chinese immediately associated it with the qilin, an auspicious mythical creature. As a qilin only appears during the rule of a sagacious ruler, courtiers composed a number of sycophantic encomia celebrating the arrival of the giraffe as an omen that legitimized the reign of the Yongle emperor, who had usurped the throne. The many nearly identical paintings commemorating this event attest to the impact of this gift on the court. The giraffe also influenced the design of the qilin rank badge used for nobles.The giraffe's arrival in China was occasioned by the extraordinary naval expeditions of Admiral Zheng He (1371–1433). Between 1405 and 1433, he commanded seven expeditions, the largest consisting of more than three hundred ships and 37,000 sailors, that reached as far as the east coast of Africa and established China's prestige throughout the region. The giraffe became an emblem of the Yongle emperor's diplomatic success. In this late version of the painting, a celebratory inscription by Shen Du (1357–1434) has been omitted, the giraffe has been given a geometric pattern of hexagonal spots, and central Asian grooms have been substituted for the original South Asian keepers."
Cockatoo,"Born into a gentry family in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, Chen Shu was one of the few women in premodern China to earn a reputation as a painter. Most of Chen's extant works are landscape paintings in the literati manner, but she also created flower and bird images such as this one, which follows the more meticulous descriptive style practiced by Song and Ming dynasty court artists. In 1721 Chen's son, Qian Chenqun (1686–1774), earned his jinshi (presented scholar) degree and received an appointment to the Hanlin Academy in the capital. He subsequently brought his mother, already a widow for three years, to Beijing, where this work was painted."
Ten_Kings_of_Hell,"This is one from a set of scrolls (30.76.290–.294) illustrating the theme of the Ten Kings of Hell, which developed during the second half of the Tang dynasty (618–907).

Landscape_with_fisherman,"The image of a lone fisherman piloting a humble skiff is one of the classic motifs of reclusion. This rendition of the theme was originally mounted on a folding fan. The painting would have adorned one side, while the other would have featured a poem (now lost)."
Landscape_with_solitary_figure,"Leaning on a staff for support, a gentleman pauses on a mountain path to gaze into a misty void. Shitao used dry, charcoal-like ink to texture the rock and tree surfaces of this small scene, imparting a rough, tactile quality. Only the tiny figure, his back turned to us as he contemplates the forces of nature, is painted with pinpoint sharp lines."
Tibetan_Dancer,"Wu Zuoren studied art with Xu Beihong before going to Europe himself in 1930. His exposure to Western techniques and methods in China prepared him better for his Western experience than the pioneer generation of his teacher. In Paris he studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and in Brussels, under Alfred Bastien at the Royal Academy. He adopted oil painting as a technique, not a style, applicable to Chinese artist aims.He moved with the Nanjing Central University to Zhongging during the war years. In 1943 at the age of thirty-five, he began a period of travel in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, living with herdsmen in the Gobi Desert while painting galloping yaks and camel caravans on the vast highland plains. Wu's sympathetic portrayals of the lives of the minority peoples and his majestic landscapes celebrating China's vast resources were consonant with the current political agenda: broaden the appeal of art, address the lives of the common folk and confirm a nationalistic spirit. He increasingly used brush and ink rather than oils to express succinctly the movement, light and humor of his subjects. From the 1950s he held an honorary post at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Peking."

Bodhisattva_Manjushri_(Wenshu),"The scroll held in the bodhisattva’s left hand identifies the figure as Manjushri, the personification of spiritual wisdom, who is generally shown holding such a text in the form of either a Chinese-style handscroll or an Indian-style palm-leaf manuscript."
Long_Scroll,"A leading figure in the radical art collective Xiamen Dada during the 1980s, Huang has relentlessly challenged notions of art, geopolitics, and the viability of cultural interchange through his conceptual installations, many of which are documented in Long Scroll, a remarkable visual record of his artistic output from 1985 to 2001. Adopting the traditional handscroll format, the painting consists of images of these installations drawn in pencil and tinted with a simple palette of orange and blue watercolors. Huang’s photography-based drawings are juxtaposed without regard for chronology or scale and include a fortune-telling device the artist used to automatize the process of painting and an American spy plane that collided with a Chinese fighter jet—a cultural collision of sorts that inspired Huang’s highly controversial Bat Project (2001–5). Besides referencing his own works, Huang also illuminates connections to important influences for him such as Marcel Duchamp (1887–1968), a key figure of the twentieth-century avant-garde, and Chan Buddhism."
Peony,"Jin Cheng like others of his generation, took the opportunity to study abroad. In search of practical governmental instruments for the new Chinese Republic, he studied law in England and traveled throughout Europe surveying legal and political institutions. He also studied Western art. His vision of the future upheld traditional values in the arts, and he was an important leader in painting circles in Peking, and as founder of the National Painting Research Association, in the development of art education.Jin Cheng's fan is surprising in its balance of an unusually dense mass of foliage against a single branch that serves as a canopy to the brief inscription:This is the sixth one I have done to dissipate the heat."
Rustic_Scene,"This painting presents an eerily powerful landscape, in which a massive tree atop a tall bluff reaches down to a gable-roofed pavilion with a cascade of aerial roots. The almost surreal sight may not be pure invention, but rather a subjective re-creation of an obscure place the artist saw in his native Sichuan Province. He explains his approach to landscape painting in the inscription:To the common and nearby places, travelers come in crowds, but few attempt the precarious and remote. The grand, extraordinary, and strange sights of the world, however, are always found in precarious and remote places. I tend to travel where others do not, and to paint what others dismiss as unsuitable for painting. The places I go have only single-plank bridges [for lone travelers].—trans. after Jerome Silbergeld"
Cosmological_Mandala_with_Mount_Meru,"The elaborate tapestry-woven mandala, or cosmic diagram, illustrates Indo-Himalayan imagery introduced to China along with the advent of Esoteric Buddhism. At the center is the mythological Mount Meru, represented by an inverted pyramid topped by a lotus, a Buddhist symbol of purity. Traditional Chinese images for the sun (three-legged bird) and moon (rabbit) appear at the mountain’s base. The landscape vignettes at the cardinal directions represent the four continents of Indian mythology but follow the artistic conventions of Chinese-style “blue-and-green” landscapes. The dense floral border, with the four vases in the four corners, parallels the imagery of central Tibet, particularly monasteries with ties to the Yuan court."
Streams_and_Mountains_in_Autumn_Mist,"Bian Wenyu was a student of Dong Qichang, who advocated intense study of specific old master painters, especially Huang Gongwang (1269–1654). Huang’s style inspired the ropy texture strokes and piled rock groupings that Bian used in this depiction of a river retreat at the foot of a mountain."
Pines_and_Rock,"Due to repeated setbacks, Huang Daozhou held office for fewer than five years during his official twenty-two-year-long civil-service career. However, the enormous energy he expended on scholarship and teaching made him a very influential figure in Chinese intellectual history. He painted this scroll for his friend and disciple Zhang Ruizhong (active mid-17th century) during a long interval between engagements when giving a series of lectures in and around his hometown of Zhangpu, in southern Fujian.Although Huang painted both landscapes and figures, he is most admired for his depictions of pines and rocks—traditional symbols of perseverance and constancy, and motifs that have long invited expressionist interpretations by calligraphers like Huang. This unusually long and narrow painting presents a pair of towering pines mysteriously encircled by the twisting branches of a third tree at the bottom. A vertical craggy rock, though barely visible to the left, is the subject of Huang’s inscription: “Even if turned into a rock, I wouldn’t be obstinate.” Among Huang’s scholastic strengths is his profound understanding of the Book of Changes, which is wittily epitomized in this line.cat. no. 8"
The_Lotus_Sutra,"元 趙孟頫 小楷大乘妙法蓮華經卷第三 卷 紙本Zhao Mengfu was a pivotal figure in the history of Chinese painting and calligraphy, so much so that, after his death, the standard typeface for printed books was modeled on his calligraphy. A versatile master of all five calligraphic script types, he made a vital contribution to the revival of small standard script. Because it follows strict rules of stroke order and structure, standard script allows for less personal expressiveness than cursive and semicursive scripts. Nevertheless, Zhao managed to forge a unique voice with standard script through a singular combination of structural balance and smooth brushwork. This rare example of Zhao’s small standard script shows the artist at the height of his powers, maintaining both regularity and dynamism throughout a text of more than 10,000 characters. The text is a partial transcription of The Lotus Sutra, a popular Buddhist scripture. The scroll was originally one of a set of seven that Zhao made for his friend Zhongfeng Mingben (1263–1323), a prominent Buddhist monk."
Poem_Written_in_a_Boat_on_the_Wu_River,"Sun Guoting's Manual on Calligraphy (687) states that calligraphy reveals the character and emotions of the writer. Few works demonstrate this principle as clearly as this handscroll by Mi Fu, the leading calligrapher of late Northern Song. Mi wrote Sailing on the Wu River with a suspended arm, working from the elbow rather than the wrist. It was not his aim to form perfect characters; instead, he entrusted his writing to the force of the brush, giving free reign to idiosyncratic movements, collapsing and distorting the characters for the sake of expressiveness. Su Shi (1036–1101) likened Mi's writing to ""a sailboat in a gust of wind, or a warhorse charging into battle."" Traditionally, calligraphy has been more highly esteemed in China than painting. In the 1950s when John Crawford began collecting it, most American scholars were unaware of its importance and the authenticity of many Crawford pieces was questioned. Today, these works are regarded as national treasures and the Metropolitan is the only leading museum in the West able to present major examples of this quintessential Chinese art form."
Reminiscing_about_the_River,"Considered one of the most important painters in postwar Hong Kong, Wucius Wong was active in New York’s Chinese American artistic circle in the 1980s and 1990s.Reminiscing about a Riveris typical of Wong’s style of this period, when he made ink landscapes set within geometric structures. The painting depicts a sprawling mountainous landscape from an aerial view with winding rivers and streams creating depth and movement. Borrowing a concept from Wong’s early career as a graphic designer, the crisscrossing structure that divides each panel into quadrants draws the eye to the painting surface. For Wong, design elements such as this modernize ink painting’s perspectival orientations. Using brushwork and layers of ink wash in various densities, Wong achieves dramatic light contrasts and atmospheric effects that reflect a wide range of art historical influences from Rembrandt’s and Caravaggio’s treatment of light to J. M. W. Turner’s romantic landscape, and Northern Song monumental landscape painting."
Carnations_and_amaranthus,"Yun Shouping painted this work in the “boneless manner,” in which blocks of color are applied without ink outlines. In this case, the entire painting is without ink; the lines for leaf and petal veins are rendered in deeper shades of the surrounding colors."
Birds'_Feet,"Here, Xie has assembled various types of birds' feet into a kind of reference resource."
Poetry_Manuscript,"The draft poems in this notebook were composed in various meters and, on the whole, comprise lines of either five, six, or seven characters."
Bird_on_a_Branch,"Here, Xie has further simplified the branch structure."
Bird_on_a_Branch,"As his focus here was the structure of the branch, Xie left the bird as a simple outline."
Birds_and_Human_Figure,"In repeating the image of these doves, Xie moved from a simple to a more complex treatment of his subject."
Duck,This meticulous tracing bears detailed notes regarding the colors used in the original.
Narcissus,"In this sketch, Xie drew the same narcissus from two different angles."
Goose,This large-scale tracing demonstrates how Xie made studies directly from existing works of art.
Ducks_and_Blossoming_Branches,"Here, Xie has filled in his tracing copy with ink washes."
Illustration_of_Su_Shi’s_“Second_Rhapsody_on_Red_Cliff”,"Passing the palace examination with high honors in 1607, Zhang Ruitu held a number of important government posts before being elevated to the grand secretariat in 1626 through the support of the powerful eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568–1627). Zhang, a renowned calligrapher, won favor with Wei by writing out texts composed in the eunuch's honor. Although Zhang retired from office in 1628, shortly after Wei's downfall, he was later listed as one of the eunuch's followers andescaped imprisonment only by paying a large fine. He spent his last years in his native Fujian, and most of his paintings date to that period.Zhang Ruitu's illustration of Su Shi's (1036–1101) Second Ode on the Red Cliff focuses on the moment Su Shi, separated from his companions, climbs the cliff and comes face-to-face with untamed nature. The painting and Zhang's accompanying transcription of another poem by Su Shi, Nostalgia for the Past at the Red Cliff, dated soon after his retirement from office, reflect his feelings about the transience of life and careers in politics."
Landscape_in_the_style_of_Huang_Gongwang,"Wang Jian's paintings reveal a vision steeped in tradition. A member of the educated elite, Wang enjoyed access to the region's numerous private collections as well as the rich assemblage of old masters he inherited from his grandfather Wang Shizhen (1526–1590). This firsthand knowledge of past masterpieces inspired Wang to follow Dong Qichang's (1555–1636) example of seeking a personal artistic synthesis through the diligent study of ""orthodox"" models. In this painting, Wang Jian explores the brush style of the late-Yuan-dynasty artist Huang Gongwang (1269–1354)."
Figure_standing_in_a_grove_of_trees,"Painting on nonabsorbent gold paper, Li Liufang used a few quickly executed brushstrokes to sketch a stark vignette of a lone figure standing in a sparse grove of trees. The small circle above the figure’s head is the moon; the shallow sense of space and the ghostly, pale ink may be attempts by the artist to capture the qualities of a moonlit landscape."
Letter_to_Liang_Zhongren,"Shen Du was one of Song Ke's (1327–1387) most important followers. He is best known for his precise regular script in the manner of Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322), whose style he helped to establish as the orthodox model for Ming government documents and even printed books. His more informal writing also follows Zhao's style; in both cases, however, Shen's calligraphy shows fewer variations and nuances of brush movement.This letter was once part of Emperor Qianlong's (r. 1736–95) collection. Preserved in rubbing form in the Sanxitang imperial anthology of 1747, such informal writings are valued by connoisseurs as intimate expressions of artists' personalities."
Pine_Longevity,"Drawing upon the association of pine trees with long life, the painter-connoisseur Wu Hufan made this work as a gift for a friend’s eightieth birthday. The pine, though wizened and covered with knots, stands proud as it spreads its branches across the center of the composition. Lingzhi fungus, another symbol of longevity, is paired with rock, an image of constancy, to reinforce the auspicious message. Wu’s large title, written in archaic seal script, reads “Pine Longevity"
Lotus,"In his later years, Zhang Daqian experienced vision loss. In response, he leaned into his interest in abstraction to create images driven by bold shapes, color fields, and the unerring strength of his hand rather than painstaking attention to detail. In this painting, made just three years before his death, Zhang’s leaves have become large, unruly daubs of ink and color. The power of his brush remains evident in the towering stems and in the flowers themselves, where he has strategically chosen to apply areas of detail to contrast with the boldness of the leaves."
Lychee,"Qi Baishi painted this imposing image of a lychee tree in full fruit when he was eighty-eight years old. Because of their copious fruits, lychees are considered symbols of abundance and fertility, making them suitable for expressing a wish for the birth of children. Qi borrowed the inscribed verses from a poem by the Tang dynasty poet Xu Yin (849–938)."
Silent_fisherman_in_an_autumn_wood,"Born to a family of scholars and artists, Shen Zhou chose to lead a life of quiet retirement at home, pursuing the scholar-artist ideal of practicing painting and calligraphy as a form of self-cultivation. Although he did not turn to painting until he was nearly forty, he was later heralded as the father of the Wu school.Painted when Shen Zhou was forty-eight, Silent Angler in an Autumn Wood is a relatively early work. Nevertheless, it exhibits the kind of bold brushwork and composition that typify the artist's mature style. Eliminating any background so that the screen of foreground trees fills the picture plane, Shen Zhou maximized the impact of the surface patterns made by his blunt, powerful brushstrokes.According to Shen Zhou's inscription, the painting was done for two old friends, father and son, who had come for a visit. In both his painting and the accompanying poem, Shen used the image of the fisherman to symbolize the pleasures of scholarly retirement. To emphasize that such pleasures are a state of mind, Shen's angler, dressed in a scholar's robe and seated on a leopard skin, holds a pole that has neither hook nor line."
Landscape_after_a_poem_by_Wang_Wei,"Tang Di was one of the first southern scholar-artists to revive the Northern Song landscape traditions of the tenth and eleventh centuries, and this composition is typical of the many large-scale works he produced in emulation of northern prototypes. While Northern Song masters were inclined to depict the dynamic forces of nature through richly descriptive pictorial techniques, Tang reinterpreted the style using more calligraphic conventions. Here, he uses the gnarled trees and desolate lowlands of eleventh-century masters to ""illustrate"" a couplet by Wang Wei (699–759):I walk to where the water endsAnd sit and watch as clouds arise."
Spring_Clouds_at_the_Pine_Studio,"A poet, calligrapher, and painter known as one of the Ten Friends of the North Wall, Zhang Yu lived in the Suzhou area before the end of the Yuan dynasty. He accepted an appointment in 1371 to serve the Ming, but despite the loyal services he performed his earlier friendships made him suspect in the eyes of the Ming founder, Zhu Yuanzhang (r. 1368–98), and he was eventually driven to suicide. This landscape, painted two years before the founding of the Ming dynasty, shows the artist in the peaceful state of mind of the recluse. In late Yuan painting the depiction of a thatched studio by a stream became popular as a symbol of the scholar's condition—a life in reclusion. Zhang Yu's poetic sensibility is expressed through the subtle use of ink wash and pale colors and in the suggestion of dense moisture-laden clouds dissipating after a spring shower. The descriptive realism of the work relates the painter to the more conservative styles of the early Yuan period; the horizontal black and blue-green ""Mi"" dots may have been inspired by Spring Mountains and Pines (National Palace Museum, Taipei), attributed to Mi Fu (1052–1107)."
Ten_Kings_of_Hell,"This is one from a set of scrolls (30.76.290–.294) illustrating the theme of the Ten Kings of Hell, which developed during the second half of the Tang dynasty (618–907). The theme transforms the Indian Buddhist view of judgment after death into a typically Chinese bureaucratic process. Before being permitted to transmigrate into the next life, a soul is tried by a different king each week for seven weeks; it is sent to the eighth king on the hundredth day, to the ninth after a year, and to the tenth the third year after death. Here, each scroll shows a king—assisted by a scribe and other officials—examining and passing sentence on the souls of the dead; in the foreground demons punish the wicked.Most extant Song and Yuan dynasty Buddhist paintings were preserved in Japan; many had been taken there from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, an important port city for Japanese merchants and pilgrims. Inscriptions on the present paintings state that they were made in the studio of Jin Chushi, a Buddhist layman in Mingzhou, the name for Ningbo before it was changed to Qingyuanfu in 1195; the paintings, therefore, must date prior to that year. Stylistically, they are extremely close to The Five Hundred Luohans in the Zen Buddhist temple Daitokuji, Kyoto, which were also made in Ningbo and are dated 1178. The vivid drawing and the intense colors of these works are typical of the best Buddhist narrative paintings of the period."
Scholar_and_Pine,"A native of Sichuan Province, Zhang Daqian learned to paint flowers as a child from his mother. At the age of nineteen he went to Kyoto to study textile weaving and dyeing. Returning to China in 1919, Zhang lived in Shanghai, Suzhou, and later, Beijing, where he immersed himself in the study of traditional painting. After the Japanese occupied Beijing in 1937, Zhang escaped to Sichuan, where he remained until 1948, except for a two year period between 1941 and 1943 when he studied and made copies of the early Buddhist wall paintings at the cave temples in Dunhuang, Gansu. In Sichuan, Zhang lived primarily at the famous Shangqing Daoist temple outside of Zhengdu, where he was inspired to paint landscape scenes and Daoist figures, untroubled by the war that had engulfed much of China.Pine trees are a symbol of longevity in China, and this painting was clearly created as a birthday gift for a friend or patron. Zhang's dedication concludes with the wish that the recipient ""live as long as the Southern Mountains."""
Vimalakirti_and_the_Doctrine_of_Nonduality,"This handscroll depicts an episode from the Vimalakirti Sutra, the Buddhist scripture in which Vimalakirti, a layman, and Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, engage in a theological debate. According to the sutra, Vimalakirti proved the more subtle by remaining silent when asked to explain the ultimate meaning of the Buddhist Law. The subject appealed to China's Confucian elite, for it demonstrated how a cultured layman could surpass even a deity in his understanding of doctrine.The scroll is a rare example of a preparatory draft, submitted for the approval of the future Emperor Renzong (r. 1311–20) before a final version in color was executed."
Recluse_washing_his_feet_in_a_stream,"Near a thatched cottage, a recluse sits on the branch of a tree over a babbling creek and dips his feet in the cool water. A servant approaches on the path behind him with a jug of wine. The couplet, excerpted from a poem by the Tang-dynasty scholar Han Yu (768–824), reads:I sit beneath luxuriant trees to pass the days;I dip my feet in the clear springs to delight myself."
Landscapes_and_poems,"Xiang Shengmo grew up surrounded by the art collection amassed by his grandfather, Xiang Yuanbian, one of the preeminent collectors of painting and calligraphy in Chinese history. He saw these treasures early and often, and by the time he began to paint, the styles of the old masters were ingrained in his hand and mind. His training was deepened by interaction with those who came to study the collection, including the peerless Dong Qichang (1555–1636). In this album, which features the artist’s poetry paired with his paintings, he does not identify specific old-master styles by name, but the diversity of manners reflects the encyclopedic knowledge afforded by his fortunate upbringing. There is no doubt that Xiang expected knowledgeable viewers of his day to recognize subtle references to famous styles and even specific paintings."
Sketches_of_Twelve_Strange_Mountain_Peaks,"In this album, Huang Binhong uses a remarkably fresh linear style to depict a series of famous mountain sites in China. A consummate literatus, Huang Binhong had his first opportunity to travel extensively when he was in his sixties. He produced thousands of sketches in response to new sights and transformed his style, shedding the traditional vocabulary of brushstrokes, unlearning what he had cultivated for years, to develop through contour drawing a more direct means of depicting what he saw. This series of sketches utilizes the popular travel gazetteer format, typically published in woodblock print editions.These landscape compositions are ""picturesque"" in a sense defined by a long tradition of landscape art in China. Huang's means of defining form by delineating edges without texture patterning and recording with the hand what the eye traces, however, is a radical departure for Chinese painting. It proved an interim step for Huang Binhong on his road to a late landscape style in which the qualities of ink were again exploited and ink resumed its traditional place alongside brushline as the paired tools of description and expression."
Dark_(Heaven)_and_Yellow_(Earth),"By the late 1990s Wang began to untether his compositions from any text, creating a series of monumental abstractions that may be appreciated as gestural art. His powerful brushwork, executed with a mop-size brush (thus engaging his entire body), calls to mind Action Painting. But Wang’s emphasis on balancing spontaneous, energized strokes with the surrounding white space is equally informed by years of calligraphic practice, particularly of cursive script. The title echoes the work’s grand scale in its reference to the colors of the sky and the earth at the beginning of creation, as described in the ancient Book of Changes (Yi Jing)."
Traveling_through_Snow-Covered_Mountains,"Yao Yanqing, a native of Wuxing in Zhejiang Province, followed in the footsteps of his fellow townsmen Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322) and Tang Di (1287–1355) in adopting the landscape idiom of Li Cheng (919–967) and Guo Xi (ca. 1000–ca. 1090). During the Northern Song (960–1127), the Li-Guo style had enjoyed state sponsorship, with court artists creating idealized visions of majestic pines and mountains presiding over hierarchically ordered landscapes; these could be interpreted as images of enlightened rule engendering a prosperous and stable domain. Understandably, this style was preferred for Yuan court commissions and for works produced for northern patrons serving as officials in the south.This painting no longer bears an artist’s signature or seals, but its stylistic idiosyncracies identify it unmistakably as the work of Yao Yanqing. Mountain forms are delineated through a schematic alternation of densely textured fissures and stark white areas that resemble pathways. Prominent black dots intended to indicate cavities sit on the painting’s surface. In evoking the earlier master’s style, Yao reduced Guo Xi’s highly descriptive and richly varied texture strokes and contour lines to a limited repertoire of calligraphic mannerisms."
Dream_I,"Chen Haiyan, an avant-garde print artist who matured in the 1980s, records her dreams in monochrome woodcuts that integrate texts and images in sketchily drawn compositions. She draws directly on the blocks and builds up layers of graded ink tone by printing on both the front and back of the paper. The stylistic na?veté and primitive energy of this work are typical of her innovative style."
"Bodhidharma_and_Luohans,_after_Liang_Kai's_""Eight_Eminent_Monks""","These three tracings (2005.411.47, .48, .49), made from a painting attributed to Liang Kai (ca. 1150?–ca. 1220?) that is now in the Shanghai Museum, show Xie's early interest in figure painting, particularly from Song dynasty prototypes."
Quatrain_on_yellow_roses,"During the reign of Ningzong (1202–24), his consort, the empress Yang Meizi, was a formidable presence, both in politics and in the arts. Starting out as a young musician in the palace of Empress Wu (wife of Gaozong), Yang Meizi found favor with Ningzong and in 1202 maneuvered her way into becoming his wife. Wielding great power in court politics, she had the powerful prime minister Han Tuozhou executed in 1207 without consulting her husband. In 1224, when Ningzong died, she dethroned Crown Prince Hong and supported Prince Yun, who became Emperor Lizong (r. 1224–64).An excellent calligrapher who practiced the imperial style initiated by Gaozong (r. 1127–62), the empress may have inscribed this poem on the opposite side of a fan painting of roses by a court artist:Snowy stamens dot the tender yellow [flowers];The rose is drenched with the morning dew thatwets my garment.As the west wind sweeps away the wild bees andbutterflies,I alone, at the border of Heaven, keep companywith the fragrant cassia tree.(Wen C. Fong, trans., in Beyond Representation:Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 8th-14th Century[New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art,1992], p. 237)"
Eagle,"Gao Yong was a prominent member of the group of Shanghai artists in the closing decades of the dynasty and the early Republican period that included the elderly Ren Yi, Wu Changshi and Luo Hui, all represented in this exhibition. Gao's contemporary vision uses the iconoclastic ink play of the early Qing monk painters Badashanren (Zhu Da, 1626–1705) and Shitao (Dao Zhi, 1642–1707). Gao confounds rational space in a strong interplay of surface and depth, solid and void. There is humor in the bird's awkward balance as it tends to its parasites. Strong blunt brushwork emphatically defines an implausible landscape."
Misty_Dawn_Over_the_Qiantang_River,"Zhao Yannian has been a major practitioner of monochromatic woodcuts since the 1950s. His art has undergone several stages of stylistic evolution. This misty landscape exemplifies his aesthetic taste and technical innovation in the 1980s. By employing a rough cutting style and finely gradated water-soluble ink, he created an image that emulates the subtle tonal variations of a brush painting."
Chronology_of_Four_Yuan_Masters,"In this notebook, Xie Zhiliu constructed chronologies for the so-called Four Masters of the late Yuan dynasty (1271–1368): Ni Zan, Wu Zhen, Huang Gongwang, and Wang Meng. In addition to outlining biographical information, Xie commented on their dated paintings, revealing a broad and impressive knowledge of their art."
Bird_on_a_Branch,"In this sheet, we see how Xie freely manipulated various motifs to create new compositions. The twig upon which the bird is perched adjoins a vertical branch. The cluster of leaves at lower right has been carried over from the preceding image but has been simplified and rotated ninety degrees clockwise."
Bird_on_a_Branch,"In this version of the composition, Xie has shortened the branch and repositioned some of the leaves so that they extend above the head of the bird."
"""Xie_Zhiliu"";_""Spirited_Old_Man""_(Zhuangmu_Weng)","In addition to a well-carved legend, each of these seals features a finial in the form of a curved roof tile."
"""Seal_of_Zhiliu""_(Zhiliu_zhi_xi);_""Spirited_Old_Man""_(Zhuangmu_Weng)""","""Chicken-blood"" stone, with its deep red veining, is particularly prized for making seals."
Bird_Chattering_on_a_Blossoming_Peach,This tracing copy served as the model for a finished work that Xie executed and inscribed with a poem in 1947.
"""Xie,_Zhiliu""","The carvings on this pair of seals appear in two types of archaic script. Both script styles are elaborately ornate, thus enhancing the pictorial appeal of the impressions."
Vegetables_and_Fruits,"This tracing, a variation on the adjacent, longer-format image, shows Xie subtly experimenting with the compositional arrangement of his model. The lily bulb, here located in the middle of the composition between the pomegranate and the turnip, is in a completely different location in the other tracing."
Michelia,"This sketch appears to have been based on another sketch drawn from life. Xie's accompanying notes identify the flower as a ""yellow magnolia"" (Michelia champaca) and meticulously describe the plant's coloring and other physical features."
Notes_on_Paintings_and_Excerpts_from_Books,"This notebook contains Xie's transcriptions of passages from earlier publications, notably comments by various connoisseurs and collectors on paintings and calligraphic works. Throughout the notebook, Xie has adopted the calligraphic style of Chen Hongshou (1599–1652)."
"Notes_on_Tang,_Song_and_Yüan_Paintings_and_Calligraphies","In this notebook, Xie recorded seventy-one paintings and thirteen calligraphic works dating from the eighth to the fourteenth century, all of which were housed in private collections and which he viewed sometime during a three-year period prior to 1949."
"Chrysanthemums,_Butterflies,_and_Rocks",The profusion of flowers in this composition most closely resembles works by the Qing dynasty court artists of the eighteenth century.
Hosta_and_Asters,"The rhythmic, curving silhouettes of the leaves in this composition demonstate Xie's interest in abstracting and perfecting his subjects, offering an idea as to how he reworked his drawings to create satisfying original compositions."
Bird_on_a_Branch,"This is one of four drawings in which Xie repeated an image of the same bird but experimented with various configurations of branches and leaves. Because this drawing is done in pencil and is the most complex of the four, it may have been the starting point of the series."
"Bodhidharma_and_Luohans,_after_Liang_Kai's_""Eight_Eminent_Monks""","These three tracings (2005.411.47, .48, .49), made from a painting attributed to Liang Kai (ca. 1150?–ca. 1220?) that is now in the Shanghai Museum, show Xie's early interest in figure painting, particularly from Song dynasty prototypes."
Studies_of_a_Bird,"Xie often redrew anatomical details that demanded the greatest attention to accuracy. Here, in an accompanying inscription, he wrote detailed notes on the colors of various parts of the bird's body, such as black feet with pale yellow toes, black neck feathers, a powdery-yellow beak, a red crest, and black brows."
Court_Lady_and_Dancer,The elegant standing figure in this drawing represents a court lady of the Tang dynasty. Xie's focus on her sloping hairline and curving tendrils of hair reflects his keen attention to detail. The dancing figure derives from a Tang paradise scene.
"Pomegranate,_Daylily,_and_Poem,_after_Yun_Shouping","In this fan-shaped tracing, Xie has copied the painting, text, and calligraphic style of Yun Shouping (1633–1690). He took care to note where the copied images were located on the original, specifying on which fold of the fan each image appeared."
"Lychees,_Longyan,_and_Peaches,_after_Yun_Shouping",Xie clarifies the source of this folding-fan composition by including a copy of Yun Shouping's (1633–1690) signature.
"Flowering_Branch_and_Poem,_after_Yun_Shouping","In this tracing, Xie transcribed a poem by Yun Shouping (1633–1690). Although he included Yun's signature, he omitted the accompanying dedication."
"Bodhidharma_and_Luohans,_after_Liang_Kai's_""Eight_Eminent_Monks""","These three tracings (2005.411.47, .48, .49), made from a painting attributed to Liang Kai (ca. 1150?–ca. 1220?) that is now in the Shanghai Museum, show Xie's early interest in figure painting, particularly from Song dynasty prototypes."
Song_of_the_Stone_Drums,"Xianyu Shu was a northerner who, at about the age of thirty, moved south, eventually settling in Hangzhou. There, he impressed his southern friends with his calligraphy, connoisseurship, and ""heroic"" northern spirit. Even Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322), a close friend, acknowledged Xianyu's superiority in cursive writing.One of Xianyu's most famous works, this scroll is a transcription of a poem by Han Yu (768–824) beseeching the preservation of the ten ancient Stone Drums, monuments carved with poems in archaic seal script around the fifth century B.C. Its vigorous brushwork displays both the freedom and energy of Xianyu's northern heritage and the new sophistication acquired through his study of Jin- and Tang-dynasty masters."
Poem,"明 倪元璐 行書五言詩 軸 絹本This calligraphy is an outstanding example of Ni Yuanlu’s idiosyncratic mature style. In many places, Ni let his brush dry out before reloading it with ink, which created sharp contrasts between wet and dry, light and dark. Ni moved the brush in choppy, staccato motions to produce surprising—even awkward—angular twists and turns. The overall effect is both powerful and quirky, a deliberate affront to smooth elegance.The poem reads:The reflection of the bridge looks like a long piece of silk;The fat toad taunts the skinny colt.After ten mountains, there appears a stream;Buddhists to the east, butchers to the west.Stalks of bamboo invite clouds to be their guests;Flowers entrap butterflies, making them their captives.Lovely is the scent of wine wafting from the shop!Fortunately I still have three coins on me.—Trans. by Shi-yee LiuNi, who served the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) court in its waning years, lived during one of the most troubled periods in Chinese history. Some scholars see the turbulence of his calligraphic style as a mirror of his times—an artistic response to tragedy. In 1644, when the Ming fell, Ni committed suicide in solidarity."
Couplet,"Zhao Zhiqian, the leading scholar-artist of his day, grew up in a merchant family but received a classical education in order to pursue a career in government. Passing the provincial civil-service examination in 1859, Zhao spent the next twelve years in Beijing selling his art while trying unsuccessfully to pass the capital examination before being awarded a post as district magistrate in Jiangxi Province in 1872.Zhao was equally renowned as a calligrapher, seal carver, and painter. He is best known for a distinctive ""square-brush"" style of calligraphy derived from the engraved stone writings of the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534), as seen in his dedication and signature here, but he also developed a distinctively plump seal-script manner exemplified by this couplet, which expresses a sentiment appropriate for a Confucian household:Great virtue comes from forbearance,sincerity comes from a mind free from deception.(translated by Jason Zhixin Sun)"
Traveling_Amid_Streams_and_Mountains,"Working in the cosmopolitan city of Nanjing, Liu Yu was exposed to a wide range of artistic influences. His volumetric mountain masses arrayed in sweeping patterns reflect the influence of Dong Qichang (1555–1636). The pale, dry brushwork set off by jet black foliage dots suggests familiarity with the Anhui School painters, while the fantastic landscape formations and bold juxtapositions of deep distance views with startling close-ups show his indebtedness to earlier Nanjing painters such as Wu Bin (act. ca. 1583–1626). This fusion of styles was further developed by the great Individualist master Shitao (1642–1707), who lived in Nanjing between 1680 and 1686."
Blossoming_plum,"A poet, collector, and bibliophile, Jin Nong did not take up painting until the age of fifty. Known as one of the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, Jin specialized in painting plum blossoms. He developed a distinctive style of calligraphy through the study of the squat clerical-script form of ancient stele writing.Blossoming Prunus was painted for a high official only five years before Jin's death at age seventy-two. In his inscription, Jin speaks of the good fortune of the plum painters Yang Buzhi (1097–1169) and Ding Yetang (active mid-13th century), whose works gained imperial recognition. Jin then adds, jestingly:""Now I, too, have done a likeness of latticed branches and scattered shadows. How might it also enter the Nine Enclosures [of the Forbidden City] and be submitted to imperial view?"""
Poem_on_a_Riverside_Pavilion,"Like many of his large scrolls of boisterous calligraphy, Wang Duo wrote this one while drinking with friends. Though the calligraphy is rough and bold, the poem describes a scene of sparse tranquility. The opening quatrain reads:At dusk, in a remote pavilion,I bring a ewer of wine to accompany the new year.River and the sky meet in the vast distance,A temple in the mist disappears into the void."
Radishes_and_Mustard_Greens,"In his inscription to this painting, Zhang Daqian pays homage to Lin Yutang's admiration both for humor and for Su Shi by quoting a humorous line from Su Shi's poem ""On Eating Light."" It reads: ""Radishes give birth to sons and mustard greens have grandsons."" Su Shi was trying to eliminate meat from his diet in observance of the Buddhist decree not to kill. One can eat radishes and mustard greens without guilt because they continue to propagate after being harvested. Although Zhang Daqian became a vegetarian in the last few years of his life, he was still an unabashed meat-eater when he painted this scroll."
Vegetables,"Guo Dawei painted this delightful scroll of various vegetables in a spontaneous, abbreviated manner. The coarse lines, especially those defining the mustard greens at the far left, exhibit the raw, artless quality that he also valued in calligraphy. His inclusion of the mustard greens' yellow flowers—an indication of overripeness and, therefore, rarely seen in this genre—enabled him to make the rhythmic alternation of color in the scroll end on a high note, further enhancing the sense of exuberance and joy.Guo Dawei considered compositional mastery crucial to a work of art and the hardest quality to attain. In this painting, the alternation between slight scattered vegetables and compact monumental ones creates a lively compositional syncopation that reaches a crescendo with the extravagantly extroverted form of the mustard greens.Guo Dawei may have become acquainted with Lin Yutang when he was studying at Columbia University in the late 1950s. He painted this work for Lin Yutang and his wife before they moved to Taipei in 1966."
Plum_in_snow,"Flamboyantly interpreting the style of Wang Mian (1287–1359), Liu Shiru used bold black strokes to accent the branches and ink wash in the background to highlight the uninked blossoms and snow. In his inscription in the upper-left corner he revels in the vision of ""vertical branches collecting three feet of ice."""
Miscellaneous_Writings_on_Zhang_Xu,"In 1969, as his vision deteriorated, Xie embraced the bold cursive calligraphy of Zhang Xu (act. ca. 700–750) and Huaisu (725–ca. 799), the two greatest exponents of this type of script. Here, Xie also transcribed several connoisseurs' comments and colophons on Zhang's calligraphic work, as well as the master's biography from the Xuanhe shupu (ca. 1120), a catalogue of the emperor Huizong's calligraphy collection."
Paper_Med_No.18,"This sculpture demonstrates Su Xianzhong’s innovative way of linking his work to traditional forms. The artist is from a respected potter’s family in Dehua, a historical center of white porcelain production in China. His great grandfather Su Xuejin (1869–1919) established a famous workshop producing white porcelain sculptures of legendary and religious figures in the early twentieth century. The Met acquired a sculpture of an immortal with deer by Su Xuejin in 1934 (34.13). The undulating porcelain sheets on the current piece recall the curving draperies on his great grandfather’s traditional porcelain figures. But the contemporary artist successfully used a new technique—combining fabric and porcelain slip—to create a lively trompe l’oeil effect. Porcelain appears to be transformed into paper. Like his ancestor’s figures, this piece is imbued with life energy and a sense of movement."
Poems_of_Inner_Mongolia,"In the autumn of 1961, Xie took a month long trip to Inner Mongolia, traversing thousands of miles. This manuscript preserves some of the poems he composed during his travels. The quatrains, composed of seven-character lines, describe the surrounding scenery and a meal eaten in a Mongolian yurt. Although Xie by that time had stopped painting in the style of Chen Hongshou (1599–1652), his calligraphy still bore the influence of the late Ming master."
Four_Poems_from_a_Trip_to_Xinjiang,"Xie composed these poems and an accompanying preface during a trip to Xinjiang, in the far west of China, in July and August of 1991. The texts, written on four sheets of letter paper that Xie subsequently mounted together, describe an Uighur dance; the Buddhist cave temples at Kucha, B?z?klik, and Kizil; the scenery of the Heavenly Mountains (Tian Shan); and the ruins of the ancient city of Gaochang, to the east of Turfan."
Poem_on_Climbing_Mt._Tai,"In May of 1988, Xie went to Jinan in Shandong province to participate in the authentication of paintings and calligraphy housed in the collections of that region. In June he climbed nearby Mount Tai, the ""Sacred Peak of the East,"" a site of great cultural and historical significance. This poem was most likely composed on that occasion."
Five_Poems,"Xie often mounted related poems together, even when they were written on different sheets of paper; in this instance, four poems appear on three sheets. When Xie mounted them onto a larger sheet, he added a fifth poem, dated September 1990, at right. The adjacent poem, dated January 1990, probably began the sequence and suggests they were all composed within that time frame. Xie made a number of changes to his manuscripts, including crossing out one poem entirely."
Shitao_Chronology_and_Excerpts_from_Miscellaneous_Books,"In this manuscript, Xie constructed a chronology of the artist Shitao (1642–1707), including notes on his dated works. He also transcribed excerpts from three texts dating from markedly different time periods: Xiaotian jizhuan (1861), a history of the Southern Ming dynasty (1644–61) by Xu Nai (1810–1862); Qiufeng wenji, the collected writings of Li Lin (1634–1710); and Guixin zazhi, miscellany by Zhou Mi (1232–1298)."
Various_Vegetables,"This long tracing copy of a handscroll shows Xie's interest in compositional arrangement. For example, details of a lotus root and longyan (longan fruit) at the far left are upside-down mirror images of the same elements found at the center of the composition. This indicates that Xie was not content merely to copy an earlier work but might actively rework an existing design."
Landscape_in_the_Style_of_Liang_Kai,"In the 1950s, Xie took an interest in the atmospheric landscape paintings of the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279). This scroll, painted in imitation of Liang Kai's (ca. 1150?–ca. 1220?) abbreviated style of ink wash, illustrates Xie's ability to create pictorial poetry through the spontaneous application of contrasting washes. The flying geese and the bamboo silhouetted against drifting mist are characteristic Southern Song motifs."
Scholar_admiring_plum_blossoms,"This small landscape is a rare example of the continuation of the Southern Song Painting Academy manner during the Mongol occupation. With the establishment of the native Chinese Ming dynasty in 1368, the Song style again returned to prominence as the model for the Ming Imperial Painting Academy. This painting demonstrates that practitioners of the Song style continued to work through the fourteenth century, bridging the gap between the two formal academies.Executed in the mode of the Song master Ma Yuan (act. ca. 1190–1225), the painting continues the subject matter and vividly descriptive manner of the Song but uses more abstract outline strokes to define rocks and tree trunks, reflecting the development of a calligraphic brush style by Yuan scholar-artists.Almost no paintings of this type survive in China; all known examples come from Japan, where this style and tall narrow format had an important influence on Japanese artists of the Muromachi period (1333–1573)."
"Table_of_Contents_of_""Xiyun_Yumubian""","This notebook contains Xie's transcription of Xiyun's Viewing Record (Xiyun yumu bian) by the connoisseur Chen Zun (act. second half of the 18th century), in which Chen recorded notes on paintings and calligraphic works dating from the Song (960–1279) through the mid-Qing dynasty (1644–1911)."
Spring_Morning_in_the_Mountains,"The paintings of Xie Shichen share features with both those of the Zhe-school professionals and those of the Suzhou scholar-artists. His ""hemp-fiber"" texture strokes and dark foliage dots derive from the work of the eminent Suzhou amateur Shen Zhou (1427–1509), but his monumental compositions, narrative subject matter, and bold brushwork owe more to the Nanjing professional Wu Wei (1459–1508).In this painting, a pair of scholars on a spring outing have paused to admire a blossoming plum tree that grows beneath the sheltering branches of an ancient pine. The nearby mountain torrent flows out of a deep valley, where dense white clouds obscure the lower halves of precipitous peaks, including the towering central monolith whose position along the painting's vertical axis serves as an anchor to the entire composition. To the left of the peak, Xie inscribed a seven-character quatrain along with his signature."
Victory_in_Sight,"This image of about 1945 celebrates the reestablishment of normalcy in Feng Zikai's home region following World War II. It depicts Hangzhou's famous West Lake, with the Bai Causeway and the Baochu Pagoda forming a backdrop to the figure leaning against a tree."
Windblown_bamboo,"Bamboo, which bends without breaking, has long been a symbol of integrity and strength. It was also a favorite subject of Ming and Qing scholar-painters. Xia Chang, a native of the Suzhou region, enjoyed a successful official career that led to his appointment as minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices in 1457. He expanded Wang Fu's (1362–1416) style of bamboo painting to become the leading bamboo painter of his time, famous even in Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia.Applying calligraphic techniques to painting according to the precepts established by Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322), Xia Chang executed his bamboo stalks in the archaic seal-script style and his bamboo twigs in the ""grass,"" or cursive-script, style. Xia Chang's calligraphic mode of bamboo painting was followed by many later Ming and Qing painters."
Scholar-recluse_in_blue-green_landscape,"Between the ages of ten and twenty, Chen Hongshou studied painting in Hangzhou with the professional artist Lan Ying (1585–1664), with whom he must have trained by copying Song and Song-style pictures in the local Zhejiang tradition. In his mature years, however, Chen played on the mannerisms and formal distortions of contemporary Song imitations, turning the debased features of this worn-out tradition into elements of a new archaism infused with a highly personal sense of ironic melancholy.In this monumental landscape Chen alludes to the antique blue-and-green style in his use of flat planes of color, patterned foliage, and boldly contoured trees and rocks. Yet the exaggerated landscape forms and stylized banks of mist accentuate the unreality of the archaic conventions, emphasizing the isolation of the sensitively drawn gentleman and his attendant, whose presence gives the scene a troubling psychological edge."
Poem_by_Huang_Tingjian,"Shen Yinmo was one of the most influential calligraphers of twentieth-century China. Here, he has transcribed a poem by the eminent scholar-official, poet, and calligrapher Huang Tingjian (1045–1105), upon assuming an official post in Ye County (in Henan Province). The poem, inspired] by two well-known local legends, is a meditation on the vicissitudes of human history:The white crane left in search of Wang Zijin [fl. sixth century B.C.];The true dragon yearned for Shen Zhuliang [fl. late sixth century B.C.].Events in the remote past are gone like birds flying away;Now I pour out my sorrow, facing the setting sun.Old folks from former times can still name the counties of the Tang dynasty;On broken steles remain the writings of the Jin period.The drifting clouds make no plan to settle down;Only the desolate mountains linger in lasting thoughts.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)Shen Yinmo was particularly influenced by the calligraphy of the early Tang master Chu Suiliang (596–658). This work reflects Chu's elegant finesse in the tall, slightly tilted configuration of the characters and in the sensuous fluctuation of the brushstrokes within graceful structures. The pronounced waviness of Shen's long, horizontal strokes is a salient feature of Huang Tingjian's calligraphy that Shen quite naturally incorporated in transcribing Huang's poem."
Fragment_of_a_Manuscript,"Like many talented men, Wang Zhideng failed to gain an official appointment but, after the death of Wen Zhengming (1470–1559), he became the most renowned poet of his time and presided over Suzhou literary circles for the last thirty years of his life.A respected calligrapher, this piece preserves the opening section of Wang's essay ""Cave among Mountains and Waters,"" which describes the scripture study room of the Yunyin Monastery near Suzhou. Wang most likely composed this work at the request of the monastery's abbot or patrons, a common practice for literary and artistic luminaries. His refined and relaxed calligraphy, modeled after Wen Zhengming's running-standard script style, suitably complements the lighthearted tone of his prose."
Chrysanthemums_by_a_rock,"At the age of fifty-four Gao Fenghan lost the use of his right hand. Painfully retraining himself to write and paint with his left hand, he came to prize the naive awkwardness of his left-handed brushwork. He lived in a Buddhist monastery in Yangzhou for four years, became close friends with several of the so-called Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, then retired to his hometown in Shandong Province in 1741. Chrysanthemums by a Rock is a dashing performance of Gao's mature years. Although done in his highly expressive left-handed style, his vigorous wet brushwork is a direct outgrowth of the lush exuberant flower paintings of Shitao (1642–1707), who lived in Yangzhou for the last twelve years of his life. Gao's calligraphy is dynamically integrated with his painting. Filling in the leftover space, the robust rhythms of the writing seem a natural companion to the flowers and rock."
Landscape_of_the_four_seasons_in_the_styles_of_old_masters,"Though few of Wei Zhike’s works survive, seventeenth-century sources describe him as an important painter in the Nanjing art scene during the late Ming dynasty. In this handscroll, Wei performs a virtuoso feat, weaving together a continuous landscape panorama while seamlessly shifting seasons and cycling through the brush modes of various old masters."
Par_nirvana_(death_and_transcendence_of_the_Buddha)_and_attendant_arhats,"This is a depiction of the Buddha’s nirvana. His attendants are all in deep sorrow: one wipes away a tear, while others seem to be crying out or, alternatively, at a loss for words. The Buddha, however, is shown in a state of near sleep, indicating a heavenly wisdom.According to the inscription on the back and sides of the couch on which the Buddha reclines, a monk had these sculptures made in 1503 as a private act of devotion. They were originally part of a larger group of figures from the Qiao family workshop in Yangcheng, Shanxi Province."

"Woman_in_a_garden,_in_the_style_of_Qian_Du_(ca._1764–1844)","According to his inscription, Yu Yuan painted this fan in the style of Qian Du, a painter active in the early- to mid-nineteenth century known for his spare and eerie landscapes. Qian often left the faces of his figures blank, as Yu Yuan does here with the lissome woman who leans against a willow trunk in a garden."
"Bird_Study_with_Narcissus_and_Rock,_after_Chen_Hongshou","This composition after Chen Hongshou includes Chen's inscription: ""On a snowy night in the wuchen year [1628] I got drunk by the Ruoye River [near Chen's hometown].My friend pressured me to paint, even though my ten fingers almost cracked from the cold. This is painted when I had more leisure. Hongshou painted this while intoxicated in my study.""In the upper right corner is an unrelated study of a bird that appears in finished form in Doves and Bamboo, which Xie executed in 1949."
Inkstone_“Moon_and_Cloud”,"Inkstones are one of the “four treasures of the scholar’s studio” along with ink, brush, and paper. The subtle dark color and fine texture of this piece identify it as a top quality stone from She prefecture (Anhui Province), one of the four most famous sources for inkstones in China. Renowned since the Song dynasty (960–1279), this fine-grained form of slate is ideal for grinding cakes of ink with water. To preserve as much of this precious stone as possible, the artist has left the slab largely intact, carving out only a small moon-shaped well for the liquid ink. The artist also took advantage of the natural banding in the stone to suggest a line of clouds crossing the “moon.” The work combines the traditional literati aesthetic for unadorned simplicity with a modern embrace of minimalism."
Solitary_traveler_in_the_mountains,"Themes and images of reclusion have continued to be powerful tools for modern and contemporary artists, especially in times of trouble. Fu Baoshi made this painting amid the turmoil of the midcentury wars, when he fled his native Nanjing for the relative safety of inland Sichuan Province. At bottom right, a solitary figure with a staff strides boldly into the mountains, leaving behind the cares of the world for the quietude and protection of nature."
Rocky_Landscape_with_Pines,"A native of Suzhou, Zhang Xun maintained a peripatetic existence, supporting himself through tutoring and painting. Contemporaries note that he was widely learned, good at literary compositions, and an excellent calligrapher; in painting, he followed tenth-century prototypes, painting bamboo in the outline drawing method and landscapes in the manner of Juran (active ca. 960–95).Adhering strictly to tenth-century models, this landscape in the Juran mode is uncompromisingly austere and abstract. Written when Zhang was about fifty, the poem echoes the melancholy of the uninhabited landscape:On the rocky [landscape] pine blossoms fall and bloom again.The mountain Ailanthus, useless [for its timber], has grownto full size.No cart has ever reached this woodcutter's path.Now with hair gray, I have passed fifty years in vain."
Poem_by_Wang_Wei,"Immensely influential as a painter and art theorist, Dong Qichang is also renowned for his calligraphy, and, together with Xing Tong (1551–1612), Mi Wanzhong (act. ca. 1595–after 1631), and Zhang Ruitu (1570–1614), he is considered one of the Four Masters of the late Ming.As he did in his painting, Dong drew inspiration for his calligraphy from the ancient masters. Aimed at capturing the spirit rather than the physical likeness of his models, his writing style remained distinctively his own. In contrast to the brusque coarse power displayed by the calligraphy of other late Ming artists, Dong's fluid lines, alternately wet and dry from his constant twisting of the brush tip, possess tremendous grace. Dong wrote out a poem by Wang Wei (700–761):Among the mountains we bid each other farewell;The sun is setting as I close my bramble gate.Spring grass every year is green;But will the young prince ever return?"
Zhou_Dunyi_Admiring_Lotuses,"Resting comfortably on a garden rock, a gentleman gazes lovingly at a pond of blossoming lotus. This is Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073), a prominent scholar of the Northern Song dynasty who so admired the lotus that he authored a treatise entitled “On the Love of the Lotus” to celebrate his favorite flower. Zhou was a frequent subject for painters, especially in late Qing Shanghai, where Lu Peng painted."
Autumn_landscape,"Against a backdrop of towering peaks and red leaves, a gentleman in a tall scholar’s hat sits in an open pavilion where a young attendant waits upon him as he contemplates the autumn scenery. Nearby, two men chat as they gaze upward at the mountains and await tea from another attendant who warms water on a brazier. Even as new media and styles became fashionable in the late 1920s, many painters such as Qian Songyan continued to develop existing themes and images, bringing topics like the elegant gathering into the modern period."
Gathering_at_the_Orchid_Pavilion,"In 353, the renowned calligrapher Wang Xizhi (307–365) and his friends met at the Orchid Pavilion (at Shanyin, in modern Zhejiang Province) to celebrate the spring festival of purification. Sitting by a stream, they held a poetry competition. When the time was up, eleven men had finished two poems, and fifteen had finished one; the sixteen who failed to come up with anything (among them, Wang’s son Xianzhi) were penalized by having to drink three additional cups of wine. In Qian Gu’s representation of this famous literary event, cups of wine float downstream as the poets, lined up on both sides, drink freely and struggle to complete their poems.Orphaned at an early age, Qian Gu did not receive a formal education until adulthood, when he became a pupil of Wen Zhengming (1470–1559). This painting is modeled after a composition said to have been originated by Li Gonglin (ca. 1049–1106)."
Plum_blossoms,"Chen Banding studied with the prominent Shanghai-based painter Wu Changshuo, whose loose, sketchy manner of flower painting built upon seventeenth- and eighteenth-century precedents). This striking plum suggests the manner of Jin Nong (1687–1763), a favorite of Chen’s."
Drenched_in_Moonlight,"Since the Song poet Lin Bu (967–1028) first celebrated the blossoming plums of his native Hangzhou (in Zhejiang province), plums have been a special subject for artists from that region. Tong Yu, from nearby Shaoxing, followed the local tradition established by his townsman Wang Mian (1287–1359).The thrusting limbs of a blossoming plum energize this composition. Typically, neither tree trunk nor ground plane is depicted; instead the artist focuses on the dynamic counterpoint of two sturdy branches that curve in opposite directions. The moon and the flowers stand out in uninked plain paper, left in reserve against the lightly tinted night sky.Tong Yu was also an accomplished calligrapher. His inscription on this painting, which combines clerical and cursive scripts—his two specialties—plays on the aesthetic of juxtaposing contrasting script types:Drenched in MoonlightThe ocean of clouds disperses; after the snowfall it beginsto clear.The myriad valleys, in silent chill, remain frozen and muted.Only the plum trees in the moonlight on Mount Gu [inWest Lake, Hangzhou]Branch out at will, unconcerned with the passage of time.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)"
Drinking_and_Composing_Poetry,"Yao Shou left government service in 1468 and retired to Jiaxing, hometown of the Yuan artist Wu Zhen (1280–1354), to devote himself to self-cultivation and the arts. Taking Wu Zhen's paintings as his model, Yao Shou had an important influence on Suzhou (Wu school) artists through his friendship with the Suzhou amateur Shen Zhou (1427–1509).Yao's round brush lines, vigorous dotting, and subtle ink washes in Drinking to the Accompaniment of Letters derive from Wu Zhen; the same vocabulary of brushstrokes forms the basis of Shen Zhou's painting style. In subject matter, too, Yao's focus on his garden retreat—represented by the Yuan convention of a thatched hut—presages Wu school artists' fondness for depicting the gardens and specific topographic sites where they gathered to create or appreciate poetry and paintings."
Drunk_in_Autumn_Woods,"Exploring the theme of intoxication, Shitao makes us reel with the unsteadiness of his figures and landscape. He probably created this picture to commemorate an autumn outing in the hills with friends. The three inscriptions testify to the pleasure and pride that Shitao took in his achievement; they make it clear that the exhilaration experienced by the friends was inspired by nature, poetry, conviviality, and creativity as well as wine.In an instant, mists and clouds can return to theirprimeval form;Red trees fill the skies, spreading fire throughthe heavens.I invite you, sir, to get very drunk on my blackbrushstrokes;Lie down and watch the frosted forest as fallingleaves swirl."
Mantises_Fighting_on_Bamboo,"In his youth, Wang Xuetao studied with two masters, Qi Baishi (1864–1957) and Wang Yun (1887–1934). While he maintained a long friendship with Qi, Wang Yun's emphasis on gathering visual memories had a more profound impact on his art. In this painting, the lively poses of the mantises, the complexity of their forms, and the vivid suggestion of movement, which could not have been capturedthrough sketching alone, reflect the artist's recreation from memory of a dramatic confrontation that he observed in his garden.The mantis is the only common species of insect that can stand upright on its two hind legs, bend its waist forward and backward, and turn its head 180 degrees. Such anthropomorphic traits are essential to Wang's representation of insects. This scene, for example, readily brings to mind a fistfight. Confounding realism, however, Wang endows these green mantises with red eyes. His subjective use of color spices the otherwise cool palette of the picture and creates a visual resonance between the central image and the seals on either side."
Plum_Blossoms,"This painting of a mauve blossoming plum is unusual in Qi Baishi's oeuvre because Qi loved the cheerfulness of bright red and usually painted plum blossoms in that color. The pendant branches intersect with one another, forming an abstract network of calligraphic lines that is barely organic. Qi Baishi's later plum paintings are primarily inspired by Wu Changshuo (1844–1927), who introduced an epigraphic aesthetic to the art of painting. In this work, the absence of spatial depth, the even width and smooth turns of the twigs, and the pronounced parallelism of the interlaced branches attest to Qi's indebtedness to Wu as well as his solid discipline in seal-carving and epigraphy. Qi's paintings are first of all reflections of things and feelings that he had personally experienced in life. In the case of plum blossoms, his fondness of this subject resulted from nostalgia for his hometown in Hunan, where his dwelling, named ""Studio of Hundred Plums,"" was surrounded by a plum grove."
Poem_Written_in_Seal_Script,"Feng Kanghou settled in Hong Kong after the Communist takeover of mainland China in 1949 and became its foremost seal-carver. He maintained that only those who practiced seal-script calligraphy could master the art of seal carving. This transcription of a poetic quatrain demonstrates his mastery. It reads:Feeling elated at the return of the yang energy on the winter solstice,In the company of the solitary flowers, I enjoy wine.I hope the rain will be timely on the cultivated fields,So next year we will have an abundant harvest and no drought.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)Emulating the balanced, symmetrical forms incised with a stylus on ancient bronzes and stones, characters are composed of lines of uniform width and rounded ends. In Feng's tall, rectilinear characters, vertical and horizontal lines are often subtly bowed and their intersections form curves rather than sharp angles. As in seal carvings, the negative spaces between the inked lines are meticulouslyproportioned. To create characters of such monumentality and elegance with a supple-tipped brush requires great mental concentration, a steady hand, and years of rigorous discipline.Feng wrote this piece at the request of Richard Lai in the winter of 1975. The poem conveys the wistful state of mind of an agricultural society at the time of the winter solstice."
Poems_on_painting_plum_blossoms_and_bamboo,"An accomplished poet, collector, painter, and calligrapher and a member of the Song royal family, Zhao Mengjian was compared by his contemporaries to the famous scholar-connoisseur Mi Fu (1052–1107). Like Mi's, Zhao's writing does not derive from a single source but combines the best of many earlier models: the natural charm of the fourth-century Jin writers, the brush method and character structure of the seventh-century Tang masters, and the free expression of the eleventh-century Northern Song calligraphers.This scroll, which transcribes Zhao's poems on plum and bamboo painting, is his best-known extant calligraphic work. Written for a young relative who was studying painting, the poems stress acute observation of nature and mastery of brush methods and conventions, as well as the importance of personal expression."
The_Sixteen_Luohans,"Shitao, born Zhu Ruoji, a scion of the Ming imperial family, escaped death in his youth by taking refuge in the Buddhist priesthood. In 1662 he became a disciple of the powerful Chan (Zen) master Lü’an Benyue (d. 1676). In the late 1660s and 1670s, while living in seclusion in temples around Xuancheng, Anhui Province, he taught himself to paint.In The Sixteen Luohans, Shitao’s earliest major extant work, the young painter, then twenty-five, drew what are possibly the most effective figures since the Yuan period (1279–1368). A rare religious subject for Shitao, known for his visionary landscapes, the scroll depicts the sixteen guardian luohans (saints) ordered by the Buddha to live in the mountains and protect the Buddhist law until the coming of the future Buddha.Stylistically, the immediate sources for Shitao’s figures were late Ming painters, such as Ding Yunpeng (1547–ca. 1621) and Wu Bin (act. ca. 1583–1626). Unlike Wu Bin’s luohans, which seem to be merely grotesque caricatures, Shitao’s are carefully observed, showing such thoroughly human qualities as humor and curiosity."
Crabapple_Blossoms,"Zhang Daqian painted this pendant bough of blossoms in New York in the fall of 1965 and dedicated it to Lin Yutang's son-in-law, Li Ming (Richard Lai). The clusters of tiny pink flowers on delicate filaments and ovoid leaves identify the tree as a chuisi haitang (literally ""crabapple with drooping filaments""), or a Hall crabapple, a species indigenous to China. It was a favorite of Zhang Daqian's.In rendering the branches and leaves, Zhang Daqian adapted a technique initiated by the seventeenth-century master, Shitao (1642–1707). He first drew the bough in dark ink. After it was completely dry, he applied a second layer of lighter ink to its upper part to make itvolumetric. Finally, he added daubs of blue-green to suggest leaf buds or lichen. Leaves were rendered in the same manner. There is no bleeding between dark and light ink or between ink and color. The result is a vibrant, shimmering effect that makes the bough appear to quiver in the wind."
Scholar's_Tools,"This painting of artists' tools—inkstone, water pot and brushes with ink trailing from the brush tip—conveys the fresh vision of Qi Baishi brought to painting by sweeping away pedantry, stale imitation and tired imagery. Sophisticated, sure and sincere, his paginating wittily conjures what is not depicted—painter and work—and the deliberate simplicity of his brushwork in the tools is complemented by the meticulous polish of the insect that feels its way across the imagined painter's table."
Eight_Poems_on_Stone_Lake,"明 王寵 行書石湖八絕句 扇面 紙本These eight poems celebrate the beauty of Stone Lake, a scenic site near Suzhou where Wang Chong lived as an adult. Wang Chong’s circle of friends included some of the greatest artists of the day, including his teacher Wen Zhengming, and they frequently gathered at Stone Lake for communion and artistic exchange."
The_Immortal_Li_Tieguai,"A true eccentric, Su Renshan was virtually unknown during his lifetime but was discovered in the twentieth century. Born just south of Canton, Su was given a classical education but failed the provincial civil-service examination. He gave up the pursuit of an official career and, at age twenty-two, devoted himself to painting. In 1842 a family dispute caused Su to leave home for five years. When he returned in 1848, he was denounced as unfilial by his father and imprisoned in the local jail, where he died in 1850.Su's seemingly innocuous Immortal Li Tieguai, painted in the late 1840s, conveys the artist's growing frustration at having his talents go unrecognized. Li Tieguai (Li of the Iron Crutch) was one of the legendary Eight Immortals of the Daoist pantheon. Once, when Li was transmigrating outside his body, his seemingly lifeless form was discovered and cremated. When Li returned and found his body gone, he was forced to inhabit the body of a crippled beggar. In Su's humorous depiction, the immortal is shown sleeping, clutching his knees, his iron staff beside him, the brim of his straw hat framing his body like a halo. A gourd, symbol of immortality because of a paradise magically concealed within, lies on the ground. Both the gourd and the immortal are presented frontally, their foreshortened forms appearing as a series of concentric contours."
Goddess_Crossing_the_Xiang_River,"Fu’s original conception of the goddess of the Xiang River was based on two poetic lines from the Nine Songs:Gently the wind of autumn whispers;On the waves of the Dongting Lake the leaves are falling.As his style became increasingly forceful and vigorous in the 1960s, Fu introduced a new sense of monumentality to this theme, exploring the creative tension between the all-powerful forces of nature and delicate human emotion."
Ten_Kings_of_Hell,"This is one from a set of scrolls (30.76.290–.294) illustrating the theme of the Ten Kings of Hell, which developed during the second half of the Tang dynasty (618–907). The theme transforms the Indian Buddhist view of judgment after death into a typically Chinese bureaucratic process. Before being permitted to transmigrate into the next life, a soul is tried by a different king each week for seven weeks; it is sent to the eighth king on the hundredth day, to the ninth after a year, and to the tenth the third year after death. Here, each scroll shows a king-assisted by a scribe and other officials-examining and passing sentence on the souls of the dead; in the foreground demons punish the wicked.Most extant Song and Yuan dynasty Buddhist paintings were preserved in Japan; many had been taken there from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, an important port city for Japanese merchants and pilgrims. Inscriptions on the present paintings state that they were made in the studio of Jin Chushi, a Buddhist layman in Mingzhou, the name for Ningbo before it was changed to Qingyuanfu in 1195; the paintings, therefore, must date prior to that year. Stylistically, they are extremely close to The Five Hundred Luohans in the Zen Buddhist temple Daitokuji, Kyoto, which were also made in Ningbo and are dated 1178. The vivid drawing and the intense colors of these works are typical of the best Buddhist narrative paintings of the period."
Wangchuan_Villa,"The elegant Wangchuan Villa situated in the picturesque hills on the outskirts of the Tang dynasty (618–907) capital, Chang'an (modern Xi'an), is one of the most famous gardens of ancient China. The rambling estate with spectacular scenery was the retreat of the poet, musician, and landscape painter Wang Wei (699–759). Almost one thousand years later, Wang Yuanqi used a rubbing of a Wangchuan composition etched into stone in 1617 for the general outlines of his painting and referred to Wang Wei's poems to guide his inspiration. In a colophon appended to the painting, Wang Yuanqi expresses satisfaction that he has captured some of Wang Wei's idea of ""painting in poetry and poetry in painting.""Tutored in painting by his grandfather Wang Shimin (1592–1680), Wang Yuanqi followed the lead of Dong Qichang (1555–1636), the first artist to transform landscape structure in painting by means of abstract compositional movements known as ""breath force"" (qishi). Inspired by the archaic convention of ringed mountain motifs in the engraving, Wang Yuanqi created ""dragon veins"" (longmo), through which the cosmic ""breath force"" vigorously flows. Calligraphic brush formulas suddenly become torrents of writhing, churning rock forms, rising and falling like waves."
Ten_Kings_of_Hell,"This is one from a set of scrolls (30.76.290–.294) illustrating the theme of the Ten Kings of Hell, which developed during the second half of the Tang dynasty (618–907). The theme transforms the Indian Buddhist view of judgment after death into a typically Chinese bureaucratic process. Before being permitted to transmigrate into the next life, a soul is tried by a different king each week for seven weeks; it is sent to the eighth king on the hundredth day, to the ninth after a year, and to the tenth the third year after death. Here, each scroll shows a king—assisted by a scribe and other officials—examining and passing sentence on the souls of the dead; in the foreground demons punish the wicked.Most extant Song and Yuan dynasty Buddhist paintings were preserved in Japan; many had been taken there from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, an important port city for Japanese merchants and pilgrims. Inscriptions on the present paintings state that they were made in the studio of Jin Chushi, a Buddhist layman in Mingzhou, the name for Ningbo before it was changed to Qingyuanfu in 1195; the paintings, therefore, must date prior to that year. Stylistically, they are extremely close to The Five Hundred Luohans in the Zen Buddhist temple Daitokuji, Kyoto, which were also made in Ningbo and are dated 1178. The vivid drawing and the intense colors of these works are typical of the best Buddhist narrative paintings of the period."
Lotus,"Shi Lu used heavily saturated pools of diluted ink and color to evoke the languor of a summer afternoon by the banks of a lotus pond. The inscription written in his signature angular hand reads, “The summer rain and fresh lotus are cool refreshments relieving the summer heat.”"
Planting_Chrysanthemums,"Lu Zhi presented Planting Chrysanthemums to his friend Tao in exchange for rare cuttings. To express his ideal of reclusion, Lu combined poetry with painting:I hear you have opened up a “Tao path” near the ocean,Where clouds of leaves and frost-covered flowers vie inwondrous splendor.I too have built a new residence at Zhixing Mountain,May I share some of your autumn colors on myeastern hedge?The first two lines of Lu’s verse allude to “Peach Blossom Spring,” a famous poem by his friend’s namesake Tao Qian (365–427) in which a fisherman stumbles upon a hidden Utopia. In the last two lines, Lu suggests that he has planned his own Utopian retreat and refers to the growing of chrysanthemums, a passion he shared with Tao Qian.Lu was the son of a Suzhou schoolteacher and a pupil of Wen Zhengming (1470–1559). After his father’s death, Lu supported his family by selling his paintings. About 1557 he retired to the mountains west of Suzhou, where he led a reclusive life cultivating rare flowers, poetry, and painting. Awash in mist and soft colors, the crystalline mountains in Lu’s painting perfectly evoke the dreamlike Peach Blossom Land of the immortals."
Three_Poems_by_Lu_You_and_Du_Fu_in_Cursive_Script,"This handscroll consists of a pair of calligraphies. The one on the right, a transcription of a poem by Lu You (1125–1210), is dedicated to Li Ming (Richard Lai). The one on the left, written for Lin Taiyi, transcribes two poems by Du Fu (712–770): the seventh poem from ""Eight Poems on Autumn Moods"" and ""Thinking of Li Bai on a Spring Day."" Yu Youren was a distinguished calligrapher. Besides cultivating a powerful personal style, he spent decades attempting to standardize the cursive script, which had become increasingly eccentric and difficult to read or learn. Maintaining that the future of a modern nation relies on whether its writing system is easy to use, he and his colleagues in 1936 published the standard cursive forms of the thousand most frequently used characters. They urged practitioners to shun ligatures between adjacent characters and to avoid using varied forms for the same character. The first of three poems reads:I remember visiting the ponds and pavilions at Xiuchuan [in Yiwu, Zhejiang province].How melancholy I felt standing by the balustrade in the setting sun!This old man has traveled ten thousand miles;The light mist, as before, sends off his lone boat.Yearning for home, I have missed perch stew for too long;Spring colors have just returned to the isles of fragrant herbs.I'll buy a straw cape to fish in the rain;To whom should I decline in advance [to catch] the seagulls?Lu Fangweng [Lu You, 1125–1210], ""On the Xiuchuan Station""(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)"
Whiling_Away_the_Summer_at_the_Ink-Well_Thatched_Hut,"In his inscription, Wu Li records that he painted this handscroll one clear morning after a rainfall, sitting alone in his studio thinking of an absent friend. There is a dreamlike quality about the painting: birds, trees, bamboo, mist, and even rocks dance joyously around the hermit-scholar, who sits quietly reading in his idyllic domain. Although he was an ardent admirer of Huang Gongwang (1269–1354), Wu transformed the Yuan painter's ""hemp-fiber"" texture strokes into a distinctly personal style: cool pale ink textures in intricate contrasting patterns, silhouetted and suspended in space, have been applied with both an athlete's vigor and a poet's gentle cadence.In 1681, two years after he painted this work, Wu Li was baptized as a Christian, a most uncommon thing to do for a man of his background. Ordained in Macao as a priest in 1688, he was sent in 1689 to do missionary work in Shanghai, where he died in 1718."
Mr._Hong_Please_Come_In,"Hong Hao gazes from a scene of exquisitely composed cultural accumulation. On the table in front of him, three architectural models (approximations of Gothic, South Asian, and Egyptian temples) equate this conspicuous display to a kind of religiosity, a sentiment echoed by the otherwise cryptic phrase at the photograph’s upper edge: ""A gentle tone readily allows Mr. Hong to enter a peaceful reverie."" But the scene is an elaborate ruse: Hong has digitally inserted himself into a self-promotional advertisement (the work of American commercial photographer Christopher Irion) in order to lampoon the perceived excesses of an economically integrated China. The repetition of Hong’s name in the overprinted title accentuates self-centeredness, signaling that capitalist consumption is the new norm."
Portrait_of_the_imperial_guard_Zhanyinbao,"Under the Manchu emperors of the Qing dynasty, portraiture again became an important court-sponsored art. This full-length depiction of an imperial bodyguard of the first rank is from a set of one hundred portraits of loyal officials and valiant warriors commissioned by the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736–95) that originally hung in the Hall of Imperial Brilliance (Ziguang Ge), the pavilion in the Forbidden City where the emperor received tribute offerings and entertained foreign emissaries.The poem inscribed in both Chinese and Manchu above the painting lauds Zhanyinbao's valor in combating nomadic rebels in the desert wastes of Central Asia:Barehanded he rode the giant whale,Capturing Weinuo in battle.The bandits' heads were strung togetherThe length of his long lance.With both hands he held open the declaration of warAll the way to Balikun [in Sinjiang Province].Without [even pausing] to comb his horse's mane,He returned and reported to his commander."
30_Letters_to_Qiu_Jiawa,"Part of a project entitled “A Suicidology of the Nanjing Yangzi River Bridge” initiated in 2007, this triptych presents one span of the Nanjing Yangzi River Bridge embellished with symbolic elements that present a complex meditation on time and the human condition. The bridge, which opened in 1968 as the first modern highway and railway bridge to span the Yangzi River, was designed and built entirely by the Chinese and heralded as a symbol of New China. But it is also the site of the highest number of suicides in China. Qiu’s project led him to research the bridge’s construction, to work with suicide-prevention volunteers, and to interview survivors and the families of those who have committed suicide. Each painting also includes a terse statement to his newborn daughter, from left to right: “The future they describe is only towers in the sky”; “Don’t try leaving the present”; and “You constantly need to go back to the past.”"
Calligraphy,"An ardent reformer and opponent of the eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568–1627), Ni Yuanlu rose to the position of minister of revenue and lecturer to the emperor. When the rebel Li Zicheng (1605?–1645) took the capital on April 25, 1644, Ni, like the Ming emperor, committed suicide rather than fall into enemy hands.Ni, who was admired for his patriotism, had an angular calligraphic and painting style that was said to reflect his character. Ni's early calligraphy was done with sharp ""side-tip"" strokes made with the brush held obliquely, while in his later works, as in this piece, the writing is rounder and mellower. This poem is one of five that Ni Yuanlu composed for the waterways administrator Mr. Xu to celebrate his friend's recent marriage. Ni apparently served as a matchmaker for Xu, and he wrote out this poem as a playful wedding gift in which he suggests that Xu's beautiful bride has caused him to neglect his official duties:Commercial boats [are as numerous] as ants,their passengers are like flocks of cranes;[It is because] today the canal was opened even laterthan yesterday.The administrator must have been busy all morning;Apparently, he has never been married to a woman whoseeyebrows are like a distant line of mountains!"
Travel_on_the_Silk_Road,"Yu Ming was a close friend of Wu Changshi and worked in Shanghai, primarily as a figure painter.Inscribed simply with the title Travel on the Silk Road, this fan has elements of the story of Lady Wenji (A.D. 2nd–3rd century, as related in the cycle of poems The Eighteen Sons of the Nomad flute). Lady Wenji, the daughter of a Han statesman was abducted and made the wife of a tribal prince of the nomadic Xiongnu. She bore him children and became accustomed to her home on the bleak steppes of Inner Mongolia, far from her people and the civilized Chinese world. When she was finally ransomed she made the agonizing decision to return to her kin and her homeland. The tragic story is frequently retold in poetry and paintings. Ren Yi painted the subject several times, choosing the elements seen in this painting: a camel, the beast of the northern steppes, a vast snowy landscape, and a woman looking out from within a tent."
Poem_on_the_Double_Ninth_ｆestival,"One of the most influential flower painters of the Ming dynasty, Chen Chun was also a gifted calligrapher specializing in free-flowing running and cursive scripts. While maintaining remarkable control of columnar spacing and the brush's natural fluctuation, his writing exudes great energy. Having internalized the disciplined stylistic features of both Zhu Yunming (1461–1527) and Wen Zhengming (1470–1559), he cultivated a deliberate casualness that avoided pointed references to earlier masters. Here, his rhythmic brushstrokes echo the cheerful mood of the poem:This year the double ninth is exceedingly brightand clear.Regrettably, the hermit is not in the mountain.My white hair is only good for being covered bymy tattered hat;The yellow flowers are still willing to light mywithered countenance.Thoughts of distant friends increase my sorrow;But I rejoice that nearby fishermen still comeand go.At leisure, I take up a cup to toast the season;Would that these happy moments passmore slowly!(trans. adapted from Tseng Yu-ho Ecke)"
The_Pond-Bamboo_Dwelling,"Lin Yutang brushed this work for his second daughter Taiyi to celebrate the completion of her new book. It is a transcription of two poems, the first one composed by the renowned Buddhist monk Zhongfeng Mingben (1263–1323) and the second by an anonymous Yuan (1279–1368) poet. The poems express a deep appreciation of nature and a laid-back attitude toward life that resonate with Lin's own:I love my dwelling beside water and bamboo.Rugged stones pave the stairs at random;Windows are casually set.Though small in scale,It is clean, quiet, unpretentious, and feels comfortably roomy.What is it like to lay back and be free?Leaning against the balustrade, I watch the fish in the water.Nature is enjoyable with its wind, flowers, snow, and moon.With more free time, I can burn some incense, have some talks, and read some books.Sweep away the dust, but cherish the green moss.Let the red leaves in front of my door cover the stairs.They are worth painting, for they too are wonderful.There are a few pines, a few bamboos, and a few plum trees.Flowers and plants are cultivated to blossom when the time is right.For the future, let Heaven make the arrangements.How can we know when wealth or rank might come?So just relax, follow the course of nature, and be happy.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)"
Two_Poems,"Here, Xu Beihong transcribes two of his own poems for Lin Yutang's daughter, Taiyi:Toward the edge of a lush forest are hundreds of dwellings.Stretching my eyes across the chilly river, I hear evening crows cry.How I love the brimming waters bounding eastward,Which give up their purity for the sands of the Ganges.The Rajmahal palace was built on the Ganges River.I first visited it in the twenty-ninth year of the Republic [1940].The clear sky is especially lovely tonight.Leaning against the window, I feel only the chill of moonlight.Dining by lamplight, life is so difficult,Facing a vase of plum blossoms, I eat my dried biscuits.This was a sketch of my life at the Central University at Shapingju [Shapingba, in Chongqing] in the twenty-seventh year of the Republic [1938]. It has been almost five years since then. Although life is hard, it has improved a little.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)Xu Beihong modeled his calligraphy on the ""singular yet correct"" writing styles of the eras prior to the formalization of rules and methodsduring the Tang dynasty (618–907). The component strokes of individual characters convey a sense of weightiness and precarious balance, while the central axis of characters occasionally tilts to one side, adding a certain gestural charm."
"Passage_from_Tao_Qian's_""Returning_Home""","Court politics caused Dong Qichang to retire from office three times during his government career. This fan conveys Dong's eloquent response to political intrigue. Quoting a passage from the recluse-poet Tao Qian's (365-427) Returning Home, Dong's spacious and graceful calligraphy reflects his ability to rise above worldly affairs:Then I catch sight of my cottage,filled with joy I run.The servant boy comes to welcome memy little son waits at the door.The three paths are almost obliteratedbut pines and chrysanthemums are still here.Leading the children by the hand I enter my housewhere there is a bottle filled with wine.I draw the bottle to me and pour myself a cup;Seeing the trees in the courtyard brings joy tomy face.I lean on the south window and let my pride expand,I consider how easy it is to be content with alittle space.Every day I stroll in the garden for pleasure,There is a gate there, but it is always shut.(James Robert Hightower, trans.)"
Canon,"Wang Dongling’s work presents a large-scale, broadly-brushed interpretation of the seal-script version of the character for “canon” (fa 法). Before writing the character, Wang first applied ink wash along the upper and lower borders of the paper, leaving an uninked horizontal band in the center. The varied density of the spontaneously applied ink wash gives these passages a rich, atmospheric quality that, according to the artist, is meant to evoke images of the separation of the sky from the earth, as well as periodic autumn floods, as described in the classic Daoist text Zhuangzi (ca. 300 BC).Only after the ink-washed areas had dried did Wang execute the character. Wielding a large brush, Wang wrote out the archaic seal-script form of “canon.” But while seal script, which evolved from seals carved from stone or cast from bronze, is generally composed of lines of uniform width, Wang’s ragged brushstrokes—blurred from puddled ink or streaked from twisted and separated bristles—reasserts the primacy of the brush and the immediacy of the artist’s touch. In another significant departure from tradition, Wang rearranged the character’s usual configuration in order to achieve greater graphic balance. In the standard seal-script form of this complex character, the right and left components are strikingly imbalanced: the righthand component is made up of fifteen brushstrokes, the left only five. In Wang’s reinterpretation, however, one element from the lower right side of the standard character—qu (去 “to go”)—is set above the lefthand element shui (水 “water”), which is, in turn, greatly compressed. The artist integrates his reconfigured glyph by tilting each element inward so that they appear to pivot around the central void, exactly where Wang has placed his seal, which reads Wang Dongling yin (“Seal of Wang Dongling” 王冬齡印).Traditional seal script rendering of the fa character:The qu radical:The shui radical:"
The_Colors_of_Mount_Taihang,"Wang Hui was born to a family of professional painters who gave him his early training. In his late teens, Wang was discovered by the prominent scholar-painters Wang Jian and Wang Shimin—both former pupils of the towering Dong Qichang—who trained him using their own significant collections of old master paintings. Wang Hui’s early education had prepared him to be a professional painter—a fine existence but one of low status. Under the elder Wangs’ tutelage, he jumped into a different social stratum, where he rubbed shoulders with the most respected men in the realm and eventually painted for the emperor himself. This painting, one of Wang’s early breakthroughs as a landscapist, is inscribed by his mentor Wang Shimin."
Clearing_after_Rain_over_Streams_and_Mountains,"Freely adapting elements traditionally associated with Juran (act. ca. 960–85)—conical mountains defined by ""hemp-fiber"" texture strokes and topped by dense groves or clusters of boulders interspersed with foliage dots—and mixing them with the ""cloudy mountains"" imagery of Mi Youren (1074–1151), Wang has dematerialized the tenth-century master's substantial forms by paring down motifs, flattening forms into calligraphic patterns, and using subtly graded ink washes to evoke a serene landscape cloaked in clouds and mist. While the painting's moist atmosphere is characteristic of Juran, the seamless progression of repeated triangular hills from front to back reveals Wang's method of integrating pictorial elements within a zigzag compositional pattern he called a ""dragon vein.""Done when the artist was only thirty, the luminous ink tones and perfectly controlled lyrical composition are characteristic of works from the artist's early period."
Flowers_in_Rain_through_the_Four_Stages_of_Meditation,"Four clusters of flowers—orchid, chrysanthemum, narcissus, and peony—hover on this scroll as if emerging from a dense mist. This is one of the earliest extant paintings by Xugu, a scholar of the late Qing dynasty who first pursued a career as a military officer before retreating to life in and around Buddhist monasteries. Xu’s late works are known for nervous, fractured lines, but this piece shows his mastery of the “boneless” technique, in which washes of color are applied without bounding lines. The flowers may symbolize a seasonal progression from summer to spring, but the scholar Cheng Songwan, who gave the painting its title frontispiece, saw a Buddhist significance."
The_Lingshouhua_Studio,"Zhao Zhiqian, the leading scholar-artist of his day, grew up in a merchant family but received a classical education in order to pursue a career in government. Passing the provincial civil-service examination in 1859, Zhao spent the next twelve years in Beijing selling his art while trying unsuccessfully to pass the capital examination before being awarded a post as district magistrate in Jiangxi Province in 1872.Zhao was equally renowned as a calligrapher, seal carver, and painter. He is best known for a distinctive ""square-brush"" style of calligraphy derived from the engraved stone writings of the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534), as seen in his dedication and signature here, but he also developed a distinctively plump seal-script manner exemplified by this couplet, which expresses a sentiment appropriate for a Confucian household:Great virtue comes from forbearance,sincerity comes from a mind free from deception.(Jason Sun, translated)"
Dwelling_in_the_Mountains,"Xie first became fascinated with the monumental landscape paintings of the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127) in his late twenties and thirties. This work, made when the artist was in his late sixties, attests to the lasting influence of Song masters such as Fan Kuan (act. ca. 990–1030) and Li Tang (ca. 1070s–ca. 1150s), particularly in its massive mountain forms defined by emphatic, angular contours and ""axe-cut"" texture strokes. The imposing trees in the foreground, with their twisting trunks and partially exposed roots, also reflect a major motif of the Song pictorial tradition. Xie, however, softened the austere vigor of the Song masters by emphasizing a human presence—evident here in the prominent inclusion of dwellings and a bridge—and by tempering his forceful brushstrokes with rich ink washes. Such subtle variations in tone were achieved after a decade of experimentation with a new method of representation that prioritized the use of ink wash over line and color."
"Lotus_and_Rock,_after_Chen_Hongshou","This tracing (the bottom portion of which is now missing) reveals how Xie allowed himself some creative license when copying a painting by Chen Hongshou (1599–1652. In tracing the original, Xie paid greatest attention to the outlines of the lotus petals and leaves; he rendered the contours of the rock in a much more cursory manner. This enabled him to use his brush more freely to describe the rock's form and texture, adhering to neither the model nor his tracing while still preserving Chen's original composition. Xie imitated the inscription in the same way: he followed the general forms of the characters without tracing them precisely. In a further departure from the original, Xie used shading in the finished copy to give his rocks greater substance and to emphasize the main rock's central perforation.According to Xie's inscription on the finished version, he copied Chen's painting while he was staying in Nanjing in the spring of 1937."
Wrist_rest_decorated_with_bamboo,"This wrist rest is an excellent example of bamboo carving by Jin Xiya (1890–1979), the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. It showcases Jin’s virtuosic command of traditional bamboo carving. His works incorporate compositions from designs contributed by his contemporary artists, such as Araki Jipo (Japanese, 1872–1944) on this piece. Jin’s works not only represent the highest achievement of bamboo carving in early twentieth century China, but they also preserve a microcosm of the literati world of that time, when members of the scholarly elite sought to sustain inherited traditions in the face of a rapidly modernizing world.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (wrist rest #38), the bamboo carving was completed in the winter of 1929."
Prose_Poem_on_Fishing,"Poet, calligrapher, and bon vivant, Zhu Yunming was one of the most prominent and colorful literary figures of the Ming period. Except for a brief official career as a magistrate in Guangdong Province from 1515 to about 1520, Zhu passed most of his life in the Suzhou area enjoying scholarly pastimes in the company of such friends as Wen Zhengming (1470–1559) and Tang Yin (1470–1523).An uninhibited, highly creative calligrapher, Zhu is best known for his ""wild"" cursive script inspired by the Tang dynasty masters Zhang Xu (ca. 700–750) and Huaisu (ca. 735–800?) and by the Song scholar-poet Huang Tingjian (1045–1105). Prose Poem on Fishing, nearly twenty-seven feet long, is a tour de force of sustained creative energy. Written on coarse paper ""by lamplight"" with a ""worn brush,"" the rounded and thick brushstrokes have a blunt strength that distinguishes this writing from Zhu's usually more carefully executed and gracefully modulated characters."
Presenting_the_Tripod,"As a youth, Wang Xuehao studied with a grandson of Wang Yuanqi, who trained him in the elements that made the elder Wang’s manner so beloved: loose dotting, bold interplays of solid and void, and a studied awkwardness of line that somehow never departed from elegance. Wang Xuehao shows his mastery of this style in this short handscroll, which depicts the scholar and art collector Ruan Yuan donating a famous ancient bronze vessel to a Buddhist monastery."
Recluse_gazing_at_a_waterfall,"Ju Jie, a native of Suzhou, studied painting with Wen Jia (1501–1583) but also received instruction from Wen Zhengming (1470–1559), whose style he emulated so successfully that people considered him the master's most talented pupil. After refusing a summons from the eunuch manager of Suzhou's Imperial Silk Manufactury, however, Ju Jie's family was forced into poverty. He subsequently built a small home at the foot of Tiger Hill and lived out his life in relative poverty and ill health—as attested to by his inscription:In the jiwei year of the Jiajing reign on the day of Mild Cold [December 29, 1559] Xuanjin dropped by and produced this paper, pressing me for a painting by my clumsy brush. At the time I was ill and had long neglected brush and inkstone. In a disorderly way I daubed and rubbed; surely one must find it awful. May Xuanjin not be offended with my soiling his beautiful paper.(trans. after Aschwin Lippe)Executed in exquisitely pale, dry brushwork with occasional accents of dark ink, this painting showcases Ju Jie's mastery of Wen Zhengming's refined monochrome landscape style. In Ju's interpretation, however, the dense skein of trees and rocks presents an almost impenetrable web of surface patterns that is scarcely alleviated by the widening stream at the bottom of the composition, where a single figure sits admiring the view."
Wind_among_the_Trees_on_the_Riverbank,"Between 1356 and 1366 Ni Zan led a refugee's life, residing with his family southwest of Suzhou at a place he nicknamed the Snail's Hut. Compared to his Wuxi days, this was ""another lifetime,"" but the family was able to settle down to an existence of ""simple sustenance, harmony, and happiness."" His paintings and calligraphy from this period are more assured and relaxed; consequently, they sometimes appear sketchy, a characteristic Ni consciously sought: ""Try to do things in a sketchy manner. Develop forms with a free hand . . . by following your ideas and feelings.""This painting, made for fellow scholar-artist Yu Kan (active 14th century), reflects Ni's spontaneous manner. Painted the same year Ni's wife died, it may also express the artist's growing sense of isolation. His inscription reads:On the riverbank, the evening tide begins to fall;The frost-covered leaves of the windblown grove are sparse.I lean on my staff—the brushwood gate is closed and silent;I think of my friend—the glow is nearly gone from the hills."
Landscape_for_Zhanting,"A talented landscape painter and theorist, Wang Yuanqi inherited the mantle of orthodoxy from his grandfather, Wang Shimin (1592–1680). A high government official, he also played an important role in establishing the orthodox style as the standard for court painting under the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662–1722).Wang derived his basic composition for this painting from the Yuan master Huang Gongwang (1269–1354), but he reduced the earlier artist's landscape forms to geometric shapes arrayed in twisting and turning echelons that set the entire mountainscape in motion. Contrasting colors and shifting ground planes further animate the composition.Wang's inscription suggests that he took particular pleasure in completing this painting: The way of brush and ink is such that if it is notthe product of lofty and profound ideas and a happy and relaxed mood, when [the artist] adds dots and washes, his mind and hand will not respond to one another. In accord with this principle, the ancients often put away their inkstones and laid aside their brushes, often for years at a time, if the right occasion did not arise. My colleague Zhanting entrusted me with some celi paper a long time ago, but I was distracted by official business. This spring I was recuperating from illness at home. Mr. Zhanting's marvelous medicinal compound worked like the seven stimulants. I recovered immediately, feeling fully vitalized, and was able to fulfill my old promise. I note this in hopes that he will not admonish me for my tardiness."
Five_poems,"Shitao's versatility as a painter is matched by his broad command of ancient script types and individual earlier masters' writing styles. Unlike most of his contemporaries, who wrote in only one or two scripts, Shitao freely varied the script type, style, and scale of his writing to suit format and content.In this fan Shitao emulates the archaic regular script of Zhong You (151–230) in the first part of his text (right half) and Zhong's follower, the fourteenth-century recluse-artist Ni Zan (1306–1374) in the second part (left half). The unmodulated brushstrokes and rectilinear forms convey an air of simplicity and purity well suited to Shitao's poems, which describe his lifelong devotion to poetry, painting, and calligraphy inspite of often straitened circumstances."
Two_eagles,"After decades spent concealing his identity as a descendant of the Ming royal house, Bada Sharen, at the age of seventy-six, seems in this forceful depiction of eagles to be declaring his proud defiance of Manchu Qing rule. There is no immediate precedent for such imagery; instead, the painting harks back to the powerful representations of eagles and hawks created by the early Ming court artist Lin Liang (ca. 1416–1480). Lin's heroic birds are emblems of strength and courage suitable for presentation to military officials. Bada, a fervent Ming loyalist, has personalized this imagery, transforming the conventional symbolism into an expression of brave confrontation and unfaltering loyalty, his noble birds standing sentinel over a landscape now occupied by foreign conquerors"
Poem_to_the_Tune_of_“The_Rain-Soaked_Bell”,"This transcription of a poem by the famed Northern Song poet Liu Yong (柳永, 987–1053) exemplifies Wang Dongling’s command of traditional cursive script. Ten tightly packed columns fill the entire space of the decorated paper and draw our attention to Wang’s energized brushwork. The piece showcases Wang’s unique cursive writing style, in which boldly expansive characters alternate with those that are tightly compressed. These rhythmic shifts in the scale, in which single characters are sometimes expressively unfurled with an emphatic ending stroke of exaggerated length, heightens the sensation of spontaneous execution. Such formal variations enliven the densely written field as the writing undergoes constant compression and expansion. The large characters with their extended endings act like visual punctuations, however they bear no relationship to the text’s content. Such arbitrary shifts in scale hark back to the idiosyncratic cursive styles of Wang Duo (1592–1652) and Fu Shan (1607–1684). But unlike those artists, Wang Dongling did not adopt a traditional handscroll or hanging scroll format. Instead, he chose the challenging square format whose uniformly figured field reveals a modernist sensibility reminiscent of Western action painting.In the final, left-most column, written in a slightly smaller script size, Wang Dongling identifies the source of this text and adds his signature and date. In the traditional manner, he has also impressed two of his seals—one at the beginning and one at the end of the text.Liu Yong’s lyric-poem (ci) to the tune of “The Rain-Soaked Bell, ” in the dinghai year (2007), Wang Dongling in Hangzhou.Seals: Wang Dongling yin (“Seal of Wang Dongling” 王冬齡印), lower left; Wuzhai (“Studio of Enlightenment” 悟齋 , the artist’s style name), upper right.寒蟬淒切。對長亭晚，驟雨初歇。都門帳飲無緒，留戀處、蘭舟催發。執手相看淚眼，竟無語凝噎。念去去、千里煙波，暮靄沉沉楚天闊。多情自古傷離別。更那堪、冷落清秋節。今宵酒醒何處，楊柳岸、曉風殘月。此去經年，應是良辰好景虛設。便縱有、千種風情，更與何人說。柳永雨霖鈴 丁亥王冬齡於杭州*Translation by Liu Wu-chi. “The Rain-Soaked Bell” (Yulin Ling 雨霖鈴) is the name of a tune that dictates the format of the poem."
Wrist_rest_decorated_with_an_ear_of_corn_and_snail,"This wrist rest exemplifies the playfully unconventional approach of Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. Jin meticulously conveyed the textures of the corn stalk, leaves, and kernels by varying the density of striations, such as between the broad lines of a leaf and the denser lines of the sheaf. The artist also enlivened the composition by adding a snail climbing the stalk, and cleverly integrated the inscription by writing it on a leaf."
Rhapsody_on_the_Epang_Palace,"明 王寵 楷書阿房宮賦 冊 紙本Though Wang Chong died young, he is remembered for his achievements in semicursive and small standard scripts. This three-leaf album, a rare surviving example of Wang’s small standard script, exhibits the combination of sophistication and strategic na?veté that is admired in his work. In general, Wang follows standard rules of character structure, but, in select spots, he surprises the viewer with a calculated imbalance, weighting a character up or down, left or right. Likewise, his brushwork is angular and sharp in some places, rounded and smooth in others. These subtle shifts operate like inside jokes for students of calligraphy and create an effect at once wise and whimsical, elegant but not slick."
Flowering_Calamus_and_Frogs,"Qi Baishi often painted fish, crabs, and shrimp in the early years of his Beijing period (ca. 1920–57), but he seldom painted frogs. As a professional artist, he had to cater to the popular demand for sets of four hanging scrolls, so frogs became his fourth aquatic animal. The frogs in this painting face one another as if engaged in conversation in front of the calamus plant, which is indigenous to their watery habitat. Qi inscribed it with a couplet:By the Starry Pond [Xingdou Tang] were three houses,Where sons and grandsons knew the calamus flowers.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)After moving to Beijing, Qi often drew inspiration from memories of his hometown in Hunan. The ""Starry Pond"" mentioned above refers to his birthplace. The Ming Loyalist Bada Shanren (Zhu Da,1626–1705) had a major influence on Qi Baishi's art. In this painting, the simple, expressive brushwork, strong compositional design, and the frogs' animated expressions are clearly indebted to Bada's psychologically evocative imagery. But Qi infused these traits with his typical warmth and humor. There is also a practical reason for his transformation of Bada's edgy style: his early Bada-inspired paintings were not well received in Beijing, so he tempered the austerity of Bada's influence with an exuberance and cheerfulness derived from the popular manner of Wu Changshuo (1844–1927)."
The_Great_Victory_of_Qurman,"In 1760 the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–96) commissioned sixteen monumental paintings to commemorate his victories in the East Turkestan campaign for display in the Hall of Purple Splendor in the Forbidden City. One of them depicts the Battle of Qurman. Only the right-hand side of the painting and a fragment from the left have survived; this fragment has only recently been identified. The complete composition is preserved as an engraving, displayed to the right.Painted by Jesuits in collaboration with Chinese artists, the fragment shows a well-organized formation of soldiers with camels and mules. The names of four officers are inscribed on the painting in gold Manchu letters."
Landscape_with_towers_and_pavilions,"Su Renshan was a child prodigy from Guangdong Province in China’s deep south. This fantastic landscape, painted when the artist was just fifteen years old, reveals the strength of his imagination and the talent of his brush. Su’s humble signature occupies a single column along the upper left edge, while his father, bursting with pride at his son’s accomplishment, takes up much of the empty space at the top of the painting with his inscription."
Mountain_Vegetables,"This painting features an assortment of humble vegetables randomly arrayed as if freshly harvested and laid out on a kitchen table. It conveys the simple pleasures of home cooking, for which Zhang Daqian was well known. The shapes and positioning of the vegetables reveal formal concerns that belie the apparent playfulness of the composition. It grows directly out of the tradition of depicting flowers and vegetables in freely applied ink washes and color without the use of outlines.Zhang Daqian often painted different combinations of vegetables, but this painting stands out for its reliance on ""splashed ink"" washes that show no traces of the brush in the rendering of the vegetables' lush leaves."
Four_anecdotes_from_the_life_of_Wang_Xizhi,"The emperor Yuan Renzong (r. 1312–20) is said to have remarked that no one could compare with Zhao Mengfu, who possessed seven outstanding qualities: Song royal ancestry, elegant appearance, wide learning, pure character and righteous conduct, literary accomplishment, skill in calligraphy and painting, and profound knowledge of Buddhist and Daoist teachings.As a leading calligrapher, Zhao advocated a return to ancient models, successfully integrating styles of the Jin (265–420) and Tang (618-907) dynasties to create a new synthesis in both regular and cursive scripts. During the fourteenth century, the typefaces of printed books were modeled after his regular script, while his cursive script, seen here, formed the basis for many later writers' informal writing styles.Four Anecdotes from the Life of Wang Xizhi testifies to Zhao's devotion to the ""Sage of Calligraphy,"" Wang Xizhi (303–361). Strongly influenced by Wang's style, this scroll dates to about 1310."
Wooded_Mountains_at_Dusk,"Born on the Buddha's birthday, Kuncan took Buddhist monastic vows at age twenty-six and became an ardent Chan (Zen) follower. After the establishment of the Qing dynasty, he lived in Nanjing, where his friends included poet-painters who considered themselves loyal ""leftover subjects"" of the vanquished Ming dynasty. In 1659 he visited Yellow Mountain in southern Anhui Province and, inspired by the beauty of the site, decided to devote himself to painting. For Kuncan, painting was a path to the self, and he brought to his art the importance of selfhood espoused by later Chan practitioners.Kuncan's landscapes, painted in the densely textured style of the Yuan master Wang Meng (ca. 1308–1385), are often accompanied by inscriptions that describe a physical, as well as spiritual, mountain journey. In Wooded Mountains at Dusk the artist depicts himself as a wandering pilgrim seated beneath a natural rock bridge:I want to go farther,But my legs are bruised and scratched.The bony rocks appear chiseled,The pines look as if they had been dyed.Sitting down, I feel like a small bird,As I look out at the crowd of peaks gathered before me.Having ascended the heights to the brink of the abyss,I hold fast and ponder the need to sincerely face criticism.Wherever a road ends, I will set myself down,Wherever a source opens, I will build a temple.All this suffices to nourish my eyes,And rest my feet.(Yangming Chu and Maxwell K. Hearn, trans.)"
On_Zhang_Xu,"Benefiting from his family's extensive library in Chaozhou, Guangdong province, Rao Zongyi eventually distinguished himself in extraordinarily diverse fields of scholarship as well as became an accomplished painter and calligrapher.This transcription of three lines from Du Fu's (712–770) ""Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup,"" is typical of Rao's cursive script. The poem celebrates eight free-spirited, heavy-drinking poets and artists. Rao transcribes only that portion concerning Zhang Xu (act. mid-eighth century), the revered ""sage of cursive calligraphy,"" whose wild, gestural writing echoed his eccentric behavior:After three cups [of wine] Zhang Xu demonstrates his repute as the sage of cursive calligraphy.Taking off his hat and exposing his pate in front of the grandees,He sweeps his brush across the paper until [words emerge] like clouds and mist.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)In keeping with the spirit of his subject, Rao wrote this piece in highly expressive cursive script, but, instead of following Zhang Xu, he employed the style of Wang Duo (1592–1652). Wang writes with great speed, but consciously avoids graceful fluidity. Often he pausesand presses down the brush as he begins a stroke or changes its direction, so that his writing is full of angular turns and emphatic pauses that create a tension between spontaneity and deliberateness. Rao adopts these same traits, although he executes them with more restraint."
Heads,Xie's interest in rendering faces is apparent in these many tracings of subtly varying Buddhist figures.
"Hands,_Feet,_and_Heads",The assured lines of these drawings indicate that they were traced rather than sketched.
Riverscapes,These two horizontal studies may have functioned as preliminary designs for a handscroll.
Architecture_and_Irises,"As exemplifed here, Xie's sketches were typically accompanied by handwritten notes on color."
Landscape,This drawing demonstrates Xie's early familiarity with Western-style perspective and methods of rendering recession.
River_Hamlet,"A rustic dwelling sits by a broad expanse of river. Having just moored his boat at the water’s edge, a weary fisherman makes his way up the slope to his humble thatch-roofed home. To depict the freshly fallen snow that blankets the riverbank, the painter has left rocks and earth unpainted and filled in the sky and water with light washes of ink, an inversion of typical ink-painting practice. The scene is still and tranquil—an encapsulation of the river’s role in Chinese art as a symbol of the good, simple life."
Return_Journey,"Under a tall tree, a procession of peasants with fully loaded mules returns from the mountains. Strong sunlight is reflected on the tree’s lush foliage, rendered in fine-lined contrasting triangles. As in Bamboo Raft (cat. no. 91), this work’s use of an unusual vantage point may have been inspired by photography."
Calendar_Poster_with_a_Lady,"In the early twentieth century the center of popular print production moved from Suzhou to Shanghai, where a vibrant poster industry drew heavily on the Western techniques of photography and lithography, as exemplified by this calendar poster for the year 1930 advertising tobacco."
Happiness,"In simple monochrome, Chen Yiming created this powerful image of a peasant’s weather-beaten face and gnarled hands. The rough carving of the woodblock ingeniously transmits the subject’s rugged features and captures the sense of ease he seems to be enjoying in the blazing sunlight."
Fishing_in_River_Country_at_Blossom_Time,"The youngest of the ""Four Wangs,"" Wang Yuanqi was tutored in painting by his grandfather Wang Shimin (1592–1680). Wang's knowledge of art gained official recognition in 1705, when he and four others were commanded by the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662–1722) to compile a comprehensive study of painting and calligraphy, which was published in 1708 under the title Peiwenzhai shuhua pu. According to Wang Yuanqi's inscription, this painting was inspired by a ""blue-and-green"" landscape by Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322) that belonged to Wang's family collection. Wang's abstract mountain shapes interconnect and coalesce to form surging ""dragon veins,"" through which the ""breath force"" of the mountains is said to flow."
The_Vimalakirti_Sutra,"Throughout Buddhism’s early history in China, the ascetic aspects of the religion—the practice of celibacy and self-deprivation—came into conflict with the Chinese family system and social values. The Vimalakirti Sutra, celebrating the supremely wise layman Vimalakirti, provided canonical proof that enlightenment and salvation were possible even for believers who remained outside monastic orders.In this scroll, which transcribes chapters 5 through 9 of the sacred text, the illuminated frontispiece portrays Vimalakirti seated on a dais preaching to a large audience. He is depicted with the attributes of a traditional Confucian scholar: long beard, fly whisk, and armrest. An inscription at the end of the scroll indicates that it was executed in remote southwest China, present-day Yunnan Province. Lavishly painted and written in gold and silver on purple silk, the scroll was commissioned by the prime minister of the independent kingdom of Dali as a gift for the Chinese ambassador."
Lotus,"Throughout his career, Zhang Daqian explored different ways of depicting lotus. Here, he has extended the expressive potential of bravura ink-play pioneered by Xu Wei (1521–1593) and Zhu Da (1626–1705) by adding representational details to abstract patterns of color wash to create an evocative, atmospheric image. He dedicated this work to Lin Yutang with a poetic inscription that reads:Thanks to the silk-washers who did not pluck them,They remain in the rain to shelter the mandarin ducks.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)This image is executed in what Zhang referred to as his ""splashed-ink"" style, which he developed in the mid- 1960s. While this style strongly suggests inspiration from Abstract Expressionism, Zhang never entirely abandoned figuration. He interpreted his formal eclecticism by invoking Laozi: ""Laozi said, 'Procure the essence, and transcend the phenomena.' This state is hard to attain. Images barely emerge out of an elusive haze-that's close enough."" This lotus, which reveals itself through a grayish-blue nebula of saturated color, embodies Zhang's ambitious integration of East and West as well as past and present."
Two_Paintings_of_Deer_Antlers,"The Qianlong Emperor practiced both calligraphy and painting as a way of identifying himself with Chinese literati ideals of self-cultivation. However, the subject matter of these two scrolls reveals his concomitant desire to align himself with Manchu hunting traditions. Furthermore, the realistic rendering of texture and three-dimensional form reflects the influence of Western pictorial techniques, introduced to the court by Jesuit painters such as Giuseppe Castiglione (1688–1766).The earlier of the two scrolls depicts the antlers of a spotted deer. In his accompanying inscription, the emperor recalls seeing a gigantic pair of eight-point antlers procured by his grandfather, the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661–1722), in Central Asia—considered at the time to be an auspicious sign.The second scroll, painted five years later, presents the horns of a species known in the West as Père David, so named for the eponymous Jesuit missionary and naturalist (1826–1900) who first recorded it in a Western source. In his accompanying essay, Qianlong describes different deer species and seeks to correct misleading distinctions made in the Book of Rites, a classic Confucian text."
Weighing_Books,"This disconcerting image of a gentleman selling his books by weight presents a startlingly cynical commentary on the value of scholarship in the increasingly corrupt world of Ming dynasty politics. It may also reflect something of the life of the artist, Guo Xu, who abandoned preparations for an official career to become a painter.The artist's intention remains enigmatic. Does the painting depict the fate of the growing number of well-educated men who, unsuccessful in the civil-service exams, were forced to support themselves as artists, tutors, or professional men of letters? Or is it a sardonic commentary on those members of the bourgeoisie who used their wealth to purchase examination degrees, official appointments, and other trappings of scholarship? Either way, it reflects a new development: the professional artist as social critic. The painting's virtuoso drawing reflects Guo Xu's reputation as a leading artist of his day. Landscape elements, faces, and drapery lines are executed in swift, powerful brushstrokes that still fulfill their descriptive function. The bold composition is likewise carefully crafted to intensify the drama, tightly framing the triangular formation of figures huddled around the scale."
Portrait_of_Li_Xiangjun,"This painting portrays Li Xiangjun (fl. mid-seventeenth century), a courtesan celebrated for rebuking powerful but treacherous politicians and risking her life to remain chaste for her true love, Hou Fangyu (1618–1654). When a high-ranking official tried to take her by force, Li struck her head against the floor in an attempted suicide. Her blood spattered a fan given to her by Hou, which was later transformed into a painting of peach blossoms. This heroic deed was immortalized in Peach Blossom Fan, a well-known play by Kong Shangren (1648–1718). Above the painting is a transcription of Hou Fangyu's biography of Li.Here Li is shown in her boudoir holding a fan painted with peach blossoms. She leans against a circular opening framed by willow boughs, symbolic of her profession as a courtesan, and a grove of blossoming trees. An open book on the table tells us that she is not only virtuous but also literate.Twelve colophons embellish this scroll, mostly written by scholars from northeastern Zhejiang between 1916 and 1927. Lin Yutang, who greatly admired Li Xiangjun, added the last colophon below the painting after purchasing it in 1934."
Landscape,"In the inscription on this fan, Shitao sets forth his theory of painting, ""the single stroke,"" or ""the painting of oneness (yihua)"":On a windy, rainy, spring day, I am happy I have no visitors; my hand is free, my mind relaxed and cleansed. The ancients called it yihua, the ""single stroke"": a thousand hills, ten thousand valleys, people, bamboo, trees,a single brushstroke and all is completed. On one level, yihua constitutes a very practical concept: a complete design begins and finishes with the single brushstroke. On a metaphysical level, it suggests that ""myriad strokes are reunited in oneness"" through the mind and hand of the artist and through the artist's spiritual communion with nature."
Woman_by_a_window_beneath_a_wutong_tree,"Yu Ming, nephew of Yu Yuan, made this painting in response to a poem by his uncle. A slender woman leans languidly on the ledge of an open window by a wutong tree. Unlike some of the other paintings of women, this one carries a clear erotic tinge."
Old_plum,"Plum blossoms have served painters as emblems of regeneration since the Song period. Qi Baishi loved to paint them in several styles, including the bright colors favored by Wu Changshuo. Here however, Qi depicts the plum tree, its upward trunk and hanging branches in calligraphic strokes of somber ink. Trailing down the page like branches are lines of verse in which Qi expresses the sentiment of a great old tree:Even when its branches droop with age,It wishes not to be looked down upon."
Wintry_mountains,"Gong Xian, considered the greatest of the seventeenth-century Nanjing painters, built up his high-contrast images through a repetitive layering of ink. Here, he evokes a wintry scene in a mountain village. The accompanying poem celebrates the joys of country life:Farmers, cowherds, fishermen, and woodcutters—where do they make their homes?In huts thatched with yellow reeds among mountains and streams.Work completed, they return together and get drunk,Jugs and cups filled with wine; there is no need for credit.—Translation after Aschwin Lippe"
Branch_of_blossoming_plum,"Xu Zonghao’s gnarled branch of blossoming plum consists of gray ink wash, bold black dots, and unbounded daubs of green—an assemblage so freely painted that it is nearly abstract. The poem describes a late winter scene, the subtle fragrance of plum suffusing early dawn when the moon still hangs high in the sky."
Fisherman,"Wu Zhen lived the life of a recluse. He was never very famous or successful during his lifetime, but in the Ming period he came to be designated one of the Four Great Masters of the late Yuan dynasty and his style was favored by many Ming painters, most notably Shen Zhou (1427–1509). Wu was fond of doing ""ink-plays,"" and his drawing shows a cartoonlike simplicity and directness. Accompanying the hermit-fisherman, a symbol of the late Yuan unemployed scholar, Wu Zhen's poetic colophon reads:Red leaves west of the village reflect evening rays,Yellow reeds on a sandy bank cast early moon shadows.Lightly stirring his oar,Thinking of returning home,He puts aside his fishing pole, and will catchno more."
Various_Subjects,"Pan Tianshou taught himself to paint using the Mustard Seed Garden Manual before receiving instruction in college from Li Shutong (Hongyi, 1880–1942), the pioneering teacher of Western-style painting. In 1925 Pan went to Shanghai, where he met Wu Changshi (1844–1927), who instructed him in seal- and clerical-script calligraphy. In 1928 Lin Fengmian (1900–1991) appointed Pan to the faculty of the newly founded Hangzhou Art Academy as professor of traditional painting. Pan remained at the academy for the rest of his life, serving as director from 1959 to 1971, when he was persecuted and died during the Cultural Revolution.This handscroll exemplifies Pan's ability to create a formal language to express his emotions. Although his subject matter illustrates the traditional theme of the four seasons and his depictions recall the brush idioms of Ming and Qing scholar-artists, his exaggerated forms and angular calligraphy embody his fiercely independent spirit."
Sketches_of_Shatian,"In this album, Huang Binhong uses a remarkably fresh linear style to depict a series of famous mountain sites in China. A consummate literatus, Huang Binhong had his first opportunity to travel extensively when he was in his sixties. He produced thousands of sketches in response to new sights and transformed his style, shedding the traditional vocabulary of brushstrokes, unlearning what he had cultivated for years, to develop through contour drawing a more direct means of depicting what he saw. This series of sketches utilizes the popular travel gazetteer format, typically published in woodblock print editions.These landscape compositions are ""picturesque"" in a sense defined by a long tradition of landscape art in China. Huang's means of defining form by delineating edges without texture patterning and recording with the hand what the eye traces, however, is a radical departure for Chinese painting. It proved an interim step for Huang Binhong on his road to a late landscape style in which the qualities of ink were again exploited and ink resumed its traditional place alongside brushline as the paired tools of description and expression."
Invitation_to_Reclusion_at_Jingxi,"In this short handscroll, the artist-theorist Dong Qichang turns landscape forms into calligraphic abstractions. In the right half of the scroll, interlocking wedge-shaped masses create the illusion of a logical spatial recession. In the second half of the painting, logic is abandoned: ground planes shift, changes in scale are capricious, frequent contrasts between light and dark ink deny the blurring effects of atmosphere, and the illusion of recession is confounded by flat patterns of brushwork and patches of blank paper that continually assert the two-dimensionality of the picture surface.As the painting's title suggests, the scroll invites the viewer on a journey that leads not only from illusionism to abstraction but from the external world of appearances to the inner world of the recluse's mind. In so doing, it visualizes the disparate worlds between which both the artist and the scroll's recipient, Dong's longtime friend Wu Zhengzhi (d. ca. 1619), must choose. In a long colophon inscribed after the painting, Dong praises Wu, who, like himself, chose to withdraw from government service to live in retirement:I am like clouds returning to the mountain,You are like the rising sun.To go forth [and serve] or abide at home,Either is appropriate.Why must one live [in isolation like] the crane and gibbon?Only those who shun this world,Can live out their days in the Peach Blossom Spring [an idyllic community of hermits celebrated in poetry by Tao Qian (365–427)]."
Poetic_Maxim,"Zheng Fu, a Nanjing native, lived through the fall of the Ming dynasty and elected to practice medicine rather than to study for the civil-service examinations. He was best known for his large-scale clerical script writings, as exemplified by this hanging scroll. A pioneer in the revival of interest in Han dynasty (206 B.C..–A.D. 220) stele writings, Zheng traveled to Shandong and Hebei Provinces in search of original stones, inspiring the playwright Kong Shangren (1648–1718) to compose a poem about Zheng’s obsession. In addition to creating independent works of calligraphy, Zheng was also much sought after to execute large-character frontispieces for paintings.This piece quotes Jiao Gan’s (act. 86–34 B.C.) poetic explanation of one of the trigrams in the Book of Changes (Yi Jing). The text offers an inspiring sentiment suitable for a gentleman’s studio.He who acts like the single-minded cuckoo willnot make mistakes.If a gentleman upholds this code of conduct,he will enjoy a happy and long life."
Spring_Dawn_over_the_Elixir_Terrace,"To escape the turbulence of the closing years of the Yuan dynasty, Lu Guang traveled far from his native city of Suzhou. He painted Spring Dawn after his return to the Lake Tai area, following the establishment of the Ming dynasty in 1368. The reference to the Elixir Terrace in the title of the painting indicates the artist's interest in both Daoist alchemy and the pursuit of immortality; the poem, which describes ""elixir rays emitted from a well turning into [auspicious] clouds at dawn,"" expresses Lu's optimism in the new era. In the city of Wuxing in 1369, Lu Guang saw and inscribed an important painting attributed to Yan Wengui (act. ca. 980-1010). Although Spring Dawn, which was painted about the same time, shows the influence of Yan Wengui's monumental composition, Lu Guang's brushwork is utterly different from the Northern Song descriptive style. The loosely directed kinesthetic brush-strokes, building layer after layer upon themselves, evoke landscape forms as might a tone poem."
The_Strange_Pines_of_Mount_Tiantai,"A refuge since its discovery in the fourth century, Mount Tiantai is a legendary dwelling place of Buddhist holy men; its natural stone bridge is a fabled point of connection between this world and the paradise of the immortals. Dai Benxiao, whose Ming-loyalist father committed suicide after being injured in a battle against Qing forces, focuses here on the mountain's pines. Symbolic of survival in times of adversity, the pines, having been suddenly threatened, reflect the artist's uncertainty about his ability to find spiritual sanctuary in a world from which he feels alienated:The strangely shaped pine trees of Mount Tiantai have been depicted by artists of previous periods. . . . I have decided to portray this theme, drawing upon my own imagination. I have heard recently that most of these strange pines have met the sad fate of extinction. It seems that once the natural wonders of the sky, earth, mountains, and rivers are exposed to the intimate scrutiny of the dusty world, they do not last long. This is indeed cause for lamentation.Dawn Ho Delbanco, trans.,"
Untitled,"Evolving from the artist’s earlier practice of traditional calligraphic styles and use of the hanging scroll format, this work explores the abstract, expressive potential of brush, ink, and paper without reference to any recognizable character form. Large areas of the composition are saturated with rich, black ink that has been allowed to seep outward, creating uneven edges. Several bold brushstrokes intersect these areas, and what little white space is left has been spattered with ink dots. By reversing the usual figure-ground relationship of ink and paper, Wang has infused this work with great dynamic tension."
"Listening_to_the_Waterfall_from_a_Moored_Boat,_in_the_manner_of_Wen_Zhengming","Reclining in a boat at the foot of a waterfall, a gentleman contemplates the cascade. A Buddhist temple is nestled deep within the mountains at top left. The artist’s inscription captures the sense of harmony the recluse finds in this place, removed from the flow of the world:The temple bell resonates with the sounds of the waterfall, and not one bit of the world’s filth finds its way here.—Translation by Michael J. Hatch"
Mountain_Landscape,"Wang Duo, believing that ""the creation of extraordinary landscape scenery comes first,"" returned to the monumental landscape motifs of the Northern Song to express his dissatisfaction with Dong Qichang's (1555–1636) credo: ""In considering the wonders of brush and ink, landscape cannot compete with painting."" This scroll, executed one year before Wang's death, is an eloquent statement of his fondness for pictorial content. Known more for his calligraphy than for his painting, Wang reduced the rich detail of tenth- and eleventh-century landscapes to simple graphic conventions. Heavily contoured trees, many with leafless, stubby branches; schematic dotting on the summits of the mountain peaks; and starkly outlined rock formations all recall the tenth century master Fan Kuan. The prominence of figures, buildings, and pathways, in striking contrast to the generally uninhabited landscapes of Dong Qichang, emphasizes the Song idea that paintings should be places in which to wander and dwell."
Stool,"Using traditional woodwork techniques, Ai reconfigures pieces of furniture in ways that render them inoperative. This visually playful work questions the way in which modernization has made China’s past inaccessible and whether, in seeking to perpetuate tradition by adapting inherited forms, one instead distorts it irrevocably."
Table_with_Two_Legs,"Using traditional woodwork techniques, Ai reconfigures pieces of furniture in ways that render them inoperative. This visually playful work questions the way in which modernization has made China’s past inaccessible and whether, in seeking to perpetuate tradition by adapting inherited forms, one instead distorts it irrevocably."
New_Classic_of_Mountains_and_Seas_I,"Inspired by Classic of Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing), an ancient encyclopedic cosmography that described a myriad of strange or imaginary creatures, Qiu began to develop his New Classic bestiary around 2004 in a series of designs that simulate a traditional woodblock-printed text with accompanying illustrations. Presenting modern machines and weapons as fantastic beasts, each image bears a title with the creature’s name—a thinly veiled phonetic equivalent of its name in English—and an enumeration of its salient characteristics. Qiu’s designs also appeared in his 2006 video of the same title."
Farewell_Poem,"Wang Ao, a native of Suzhou, was one of the most famous literary figures of his day. He also enjoyed a successful career at the court, rising to the position of grand secretary and junior tutor to the emperor.Wang created this scroll at the height of his court career as a farewell present for fellow official Wu Yan (1457–1519). Wu had been deputized by the emperor to serve as an honorary escort to his uncle Xu Pu (1428–1499), when Xu retired from the Grand Secretariat. Following the poem, Wang added a note describing this event and signed the piece with all his court titles, thus transforming a private gift into a powerful public testimonial of Wu's honorary role as the emperor's emissary.As befits this kind of formal presentation piece, Wang wrote his text in dramatic large-scale characters that show off to maximum advantage his distinctive style of lean angular brushwork with its sharp firm movements. In recent years, the scroll was a treasured possession of the artist and collector C. C. Wang, who also comes from Suzhou and traces his family lineage to Wang Ao."
Landscape_inspired_by_Yun_Shouping_studying_Huang_Gongwang,"Painting in the bustling, modern Shanghai of the 1930s, Fan Haolin continued to develop the historically oriented tradition of antiquarian painting, attempting to adapt it to the changing circumstances of the Republic period. Fan’s inscription reveals that he made this painting in homage to the early Qing-dynasty painter Yun Shouping (1633–1690). Atop a cliff in the lower section of the painting, a group of men in a thatched pavilion take advantage of the dramatic scenery to convene an elegant gathering amid the red leaves of autumn."
Dream,"This print comes from a series of twelve prints that illustrate and narrate the artist’s dreams. Chen Haiyan records her dreams daily and reproduces them in a sketchy, sometimes naive style. This work tells her dream of fishing in a river.Chen, a leading printmaker in China, developed an innovative and individualist approach when artistic censorship was loosened in the 1980s. This work is representative of her experimentation."
Early_Spring,"The freshness and insouciance of early spring is conveyed here in an exquisite lacework of fine tree branches and its rippled reflection in a lake. This lyrical print differs radically from the artist’s early works with explicit political references, such as Burning up Land Deeds (cat. no. 66). Produced one year after Deng Xiaoping announced his political and economic reforms in 1978, it attests to the catalytic power of politics on the arts."
Chatting_over_Tea,"In the dim light of a teashop interior, the silhouettes of two conversing men appear like paper cutouts. Wu Jide captures the intimacy of this moment of leisure through a masterful use of color gradations.Wu Jide has spent his whole life in the Yangzi River delta region. Scenes from his home county are often the subjects of his art. This print ranks among his best."
Old_Vines_above_Ancient_Wall,"The old tree at the center of this print exudes vibrant vitality in its sinewy trunk and dense foliage. The vantage point from below endows it with a majestic aura, while the wild vines animate the view with dynamic lines. This print, thoroughly different from the artist’s early works, which were loaded with sociopolitical messages, demonstrates how his subject and style had evolved over the course of a long and prolific career."
Phantom_Landscapes_III,"Yang Yongliang created the exquisite atmospheric effects of this landscape print by digitally manipulating photographic images. At first sight it seems to be a modern imitation of classic Southern Song (1127–1279) painting, in which sensitively gradated ink washes evoke visual poetry. Upon closer examination, telegraph poles and skyscrapers have replaced trees and mountains to reveal glimpses of modern China.Yang was well trained in classical calligraphy and painting in his early years. This work demonstrates his skill in integrating traditional art forms and modern technology."
"East_Lake,_Shaoxing","This haunting landscape of East Lake in Shaoxing, in southeast China, seems to present its mountainous shores bathed in moonlight. The watery reflections of the deeply creviced cliffs and pleasure boats intensify the scene’s mystic allure. The faint blue and pink tints on the rocks seem to simulate a black-lacquered surface decorated with mother-of-pearl inlay."

This work demonstrates his skill in integrating traditional art forms and modern technology."
Village_People,"A major work in Lin Yixiang’s oeuvre, this large print presents the happy encounter of China’s traditional and modern worlds. In a modern department store, rustic village women are amused by a robot puppet proffered by a young saleswoman.Lin employed special techniques to create this work. She used small pieces of wood with distinct grain patterns to print the green and blue parts of the women’s clothing, and pieces of real fabric to achieve the texture of the beige jackets."
Sun_Rising_in_the_Eastern_Sky,"This print depicts a magnificent shipyard with towering cranes and huge ships hovering over antlike dock workers. The entire scene is dramatically illuminated in the hazy morning light. It recalls in both style and subject Soviet Social Realist art, which was championed in the 1950s and 1960s to glorify modernization and progress.Li Hongren is known for his lithographs on subjects as diverse as portraiture and industrial scenes. This work is considered among his best."
Mount_Huang_Series_No._5,"The late 1970s witnessed a return to traditionalism with the revival of printing with water-soluble inks. A leading exponent of this trend, Zhao Zongzao created a new landscape style of abbreviated compositions by highlighting the grain of the woodblock. Here, he uses this new technique to suggest the natural textures of the granite cliffs of Mount Huang (Yellow Mountain)."
Country_Sentiments,"In 1958 multitudes of demobilized soldiers were sent to develop the vast wilderness in northern Manchuria. Among them were artists who started an active project of printmaking. With its colorful and heroic imagery, the movement soon gained national influence. An early major exponent was Hao Boyi, originally an oil painter.As demonstrated in this fascinating work, Hao’s favorite subjects are cranes and village life, especially in spring and autumn settings. An evocative vignette, it reveals vague nostalgia through familiar imagery in a brooding palette."
Bamboo_Raft,"This majestic landscape depicts an imposing river valley in Sichuan. A slender bamboo raft is glimpsed from an elevated viewpoint between towering firs. The narrow focus and cropped trees recall photographic practice, while the textural refinement of the dense foliage compares closely with that of engraving or etching. A longtime faculty member of the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts, Jiang Mi excels in the strong monochromatic print style that is the academy’s hallmark."
"Untitled,_from_the_series_Calligraphy","In addition to printmaking, Han Likun also practices painting, calligraphy, and seal carving, absorbing ideas from traditional painting that has undergone a revival since the death of Chairman Mao in 1976. In this mixed-media print, he created a semiabstract composition inspired by landscape painting and archaic motifs and scripts. Studied na?veté is characteristic of his works from the 1980s and 1990s."
Quiet_Riverbank,"In this vast landscape, rows of lush trees are reduced to abstract patterns, which are juxtaposed with realistic images of boats. The dark shadows on the water in the foreground and the shimmering morning light in the distance soften the scene with a touch of lyricism.First a student and later an instructor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, Song Yuanwen has become one of the most influential printmakers in modern China."
Divine_Light_2000–8,"Exploiting the potential of the ink medium to create powerful nonfigurative works, this piece from Zhang’s Divine Light series presents abstract geometric fields interwoven with irregular bands in starkly contrasting shades of ink monochrome. Animating the picture surface are webs of delicate crackles and clusters of water drops, creating a sparkling, vibrating visual effect. 2000–8 resembles a cross section of a sedimentary rock that is undergoing metamorphosis."
Peonies_and_Mountain_Laurel,This meticulous tracing shows a degree of naturalism and compositional density that suggests an eighteenth-century model.
Drinking_in_the_Bamboo_Garden_on_the_Lantern_Festival,"Painted at the end of Luo Ping's first Beijing sojourn, this depiction of a gathering beneath a lantern to celebrate the first full moon of the year commemorates a moment of social interaction between the artist and his patron-friends. The ""Bamboo Garden"" mentioned in Luo's inscription may refer to the famous Yangzhou property he had visited with his mentor, Jin Nong (1687–1763). The scene represents a nostalgic evocation of the southern metropolis—a vision his Beijing patrons would have found appealing.The clearly articulated composition and painterly effects, indicative of Luo's gradual departure from Jin Nong's artistic legacy, are characteristic of his mid-career."
The_Studio_of_Prolonged_Soughing,"Leaning on a staff for support, a gentleman approaches the gate of a garden retreat. In a small tile-roofed structure at the center of the retreat sits the host, who awaits his guests. This depiction of a garden retreat was painted by You Yin, a scholar-painter who mixed in elite circles in Beijing during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. According to You’s inscription, the scene depicts a villa in the Southern City section of Beijing that was home to most scholars who traveled from around the empire to serve at court. The recipient is identified only by his nickname, Old Man Yue, and his identity remains a mystery."
Mirror-images_of_a_Bird,"Rather than draw the same image twice, Xie often began with a preliminary sketch and then folded the paper to trace it again, making the tentative lines of his original smoother and more assured and adding more details."
Gathering_at_the_Orchid_Pavilion,"Qian Gong worked in Suzhou in the waning years of the Ming dynasty. His depiction of the Gathering at the Orchid Pavilion is unusual in that it is painted on figured damask, silk woven with a pictorial pattern. This type of support is rarely used for paintings because the dueling images of the silk ground and the painting can be difficult for the eye to parse. This piece of silk must have been particularly treasured, as Qian notes in his signature that the painting’s recipient made a special request for him to paint on it."
The_Sound_of_Spring_in_a_Lonely_Valley,"Inscriptions after the artist (right): ""The Sound of Spring in a Lonely Valley, the first lunar month of spring in the xinchou year [January 30–February 28, 1661], painted for the gentleman Jiaoru, Hongren"" and after Chen Shu [jinshi degree, 1649, left] Hongren, a filial son who helped support his mother after his father's premature death, passed the local civil-service examination during the late Ming period but ended his pursuit of an official career after the fall of the dynasty in 1644. Becoming a Buddhist monk as a way of avoiding service under the Manchus, Hongren spent the rest of his life in his native Anhui Province, where he became the central figure in the so-called Anhui School of painters, whose common bond was their fascination with the rugged scenery of Yellow Mountain (Mount Huang).Hongren favored a dry linear technique that echoes the style of the Yuan dynasty recluse-painter Ni Zan (1306–1374). In this scroll Ni's influence is apparent in the spindly foreground trees and angular rock formations. The diminishing scale of the trees helps define recession and emphasizes the overwhelming size of the towering cliff at center, which dominates the composition and imparts a monumentality similar to that of the grandly scaled peaks of Northern Song (960–1127) works.While the painting has long been admired as an original Hongren, weaknesses in the brushwork of the calligraphy and landscape forms suggest that it is actually a close copy."
Ink_bamboo,"The tip of a young bamboo plant leans into view from the left edge of this painting, as if blown there by the wind. Li Shan arranged his lengthy inscription around the leaves, creating a dynamic interplay between word and image. The inscription contains a long poem about the history of bamboo painting from the eleventh century to the artist’s own time. After describing all the great masters who preceded him, he boldly declares that “my own bamboo belongs to yet another school.”"
Stealing_the_Orchid_Pavilion_Manuscript,"Fu Xiaoshi belongs to the youngest generation represented in the Ellsworth collection—the generation that came of age during the decades of purge and Cultural Revolution. Fu Xiaoshi, as the son of Fu Baoshi had a privileged position that included training in traditional Chinese painting as well as a degree from the Central Academy of Fine Arts. While a student however, his criticism of the government earned him confinement to a labor camp, and during the Cultural Revolution he was sentenced to jail as a counter-revolutionary.This painting belongs to the period after the mid-1970s when Fu began to paint with his left hand because of a stroke. The subject of the painting is a familiar one: Emperor Taizong (r. 627–49) was fanatical about owning all famous versions of the Lanting manuscript, a set of poems written by Wang Xhizhi (4th century) after a day-long gathering of literati. He sent his Minister Xiaoyi to retrieve a copy kept illicitly by the monk Bianzai. The minister posing as a visitor to the temple, waits with a warrant up his sleeve, ready to pounce the moment the greedy monk reveals where the manuscript is hidden. In this painting, the monk, casually flourishing his flywhisk is unable to resist boasting about his treasure. The tension and psychological acuity of Fu's painting are striking, as is the absence of the common tendency in contemporary Chinese painting toward exaggeration or caricature."
Landscapes_of_the_Four_Seasons,"Shitao frequently employed the album format to give full play to his imaginative use of brush techniques and compositional designs. In this series of eight leaves, datable stylistically to the last decade of the artist's life, he explores the theme of landscape. Working in a free, wet-ink manner, Shitao reveals his independence from conventional models and methods in these highly personal images. As he observed in his Recorded Sayings on Painting of about 1700:Even if my brush does not resemble brush and my ink does not resemble ink and my painting does not resemble painting, I make sure that my self is always present in my work.(Wen Fong, trans.)"
Two_hawks_in_a_thicket,"One of the leading court painters of bird-and-flower scenes, the Cantonese artist Lin Liang specialized in bold, expressive, monochrome depictions of birds in the wild.Never before had there been such hawks as those painted by Lin Liang. Standing like monuments to strength and courage on the highest frozen peaks swept by bitter winds, living in worlds that lesser creatures could not inhabit, Lin's great birds are embodiments of heroism. In contrast to his usual image of hawks silhouetted against the sky and surveying their surroundings from a high perch, however, these noble birds appear withdrawn and reclusive, inviolable and inaccessible, as if lost in a dense forest of old trees and thick bamboo where no one could possibly reach them."
Returning_home_through_the_snow,"A solitary figure, too humbly dressed for the cold buffeting wind, draws a protective sleeve to his face as he quickly makes his way to the comfort of the dwelling nestled among bare trees and snow-laden bamboo—perhaps Dai's own Bamboo Snow Studio. Dai Jin was one of the last major masters to embody the artistic traditions of the Southern Song Imperial Painting Academy, but he was also a very versatile painter who drew inspiration from diverse sources. In this painting, the manner of outlining forms with a gentle sinuous line, the large and powerful deciduous trees, and the scale of the figure in relationship to the setting recall the works of the Yuan artist Sheng Mou (act. ca. 1310–60).The tendency toward swift, sketchy, cursive brushwork here is a hallmark of Dai Jin's later work. Dai sometimes painted precariously close to the edge of control, creating a distinctively kinesthetic, movement-filled style that was fresh and new and that would greatly influence later Ming professional painting."
Portrait_of_the_artist’s_great-granduncle_Yizhai_at_the_age_of_eighty-five,"This portrait was made to celebrate the eighty-fifth birthday of the sitter, who is identified in the inscription as the artist’s great granduncle Yizhai. Portraits of couples were sometimes made on milestone birthdays of the husband; while the couple lived, the paintings allowed the family to celebrate them, and after their deaths the images could be repurposed for ritual veneration. The features of the man in this portrait are beautifully characterized—his high cheekbones, pursed lips, and gentle gaze communicate a sense of kindness and the wisdom of age."
Seated_Musician,"This amiable flute (chi) player is poised in anticipation of bringing the instrument to his lips. The chi was the predecessor of the two types of flute used in Chinese music today—the end-blown, vertically held xiao and the transverse flute depicted here, which is now known as the dizi."
Crooked_Pine,"Because it retains its greenery even in the dead of winter, the pine symbolizes endurance and fortitude. For Yuan-dynasty scholars living under the alien rule of the Mongols, depictions of ancient pines became a potent metaphor for survival in the face of political discrimination.Wu Zhen was an educated man who in more settled times would have followed a career in government service. He chose instead to live in reclusion in the mountains of Zhejiang Province. Calling himself the Plum Blossom Daoist (Meihua Daoren), he made a humble living through the practice of divination.In his inscription, Wu describes the source of his inspiration for this painting:In winter, the eleventh lunar month of the third year of theYuantong reign era [December 1335], while visiting theCloudy Grotto, I saw a crooked and twisting ancient tree.So I wrote this picture to record what I saw. Meihua Daoren[the Plum Blossom Daoist, Wu Zhen] playing with ink."
Peony,"Wang Wu painted this fan using the “boneless manner” (mogu fa), in which blocks of color are used to define shapes without ink outlines."
Peach_Blossom_Spring,"""Peach Blossom Spring,"" as first told by the poet Tao Qian (365–427), is the tale of a fisherman who, having followed a stream lined with blossoming peach trees, stumbles upon an idyllic community that for generations has been sequestered from political and social upheavals. He eventually takes his leave, but when he tries to find the stream again, it has vanished.In Zhang Hong's keenly observed interpretation, the viewer is led from a winding stream through a cloudbank to the spot where the fisherman, oar in hand, first encounters the sheltered people, whose clothing styles haven't changed since the Qin dynasty (221–207 B.C.). The remainder of the scroll lovingly examines the ageless rhythms of rural life, especially those related to rice cultivation and silk production. Painted just six years before the collapse of the Ming dynasty, this vision of a utopian world must have been especially appealing.Zhang Hong, a native of Suzhou, was an accomplished landscape and figure painter who became known as a Ming loyalist in the early years of the Manchu Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Mounted after Zhang's painting is another version of the story composed by Wang Wei (701–761), and transcribed by Zhang's fellow townsman Fan Yunlin (1558–1641), a scholar-official and calligrapher."
Lofty_mountains,"Hou Maogong was a student of both Wen Zhengming (1470–1559) and Qian Gu (1508–1574). Inscriptions on his surviving works, ranging in date from 1544 to 1577, show that he was also on intimate terms with Wen's sons, Wen Peng (1498–1573) and Wen Jia (1501–1583), as well as with other members of the Suzhou artistic circle. High Mountains has the narrow format, pastel coloration, and attenuated figures, trees, and rocks that are typical of late-Wen-school landscape paintings. Hou's works are considered rare."
Bamboo_copied_after_Wen_Tong,"This dramatically cropped image of bamboo reveals neither the plant's base nor its tip; rather, the leaves and branches seem to defy gravity, giving the pendent bough a sense of dynamic movement and growth. The contrasting ink tones and thrusting brushstrokes that define the leaves add to the vitality of the image.Ke Jiusi, a leading connoisseur and curator of the imperial art collection, here demonstrates his scholarly approach to the study of antique models by freely copying a work by the Northern Song master Wen Tong (1019–1079), the patriarch of the monochrome bamboo genre."
"Bamboo,_plum,_and_rock","Only after failing in his pursuit of a career as a government official did Li Fangying dedicate himself to painting as a means of survival. For Li and men like him, the plum, which dares to bloom in the cold of late winter, was a symbol of perseverance in a world that did not appreciate their talents. Li’s love of blossoming plum was such that he named his studio the Plum Blossom Tower; it was there, in 1743, that he made this painting. The poem reads, in part:The mist engulfing the empty mountains hasn’t dissipated at dawn.In the dim light it reflects upon itself whose talent is appreciated by none other.Exemplary of the spirit against winter’s bitter cold, it cannot be subdued.New signs have arrived from heaven.—Translation by Shi-yee Liu"
Landscape_with_Trees_in_the_Manner_of_Ni_Zan_(1301–1374),"Dong Qichang revived the tenets of the scholar-painter: to follow the ancient models and to apply the principles of calligraphy to painting. In proposing a ""great synthesis"" of all ancient landscape idioms, Dong turned landscape forms into calligraphic abstractions. The most desirable element in painting, according to Dong, was brushwork rather than representation: ""If one considers the wonders of brush and ink, real landscape can never equal painting.""This painting is an interpretation of the Yuan master Ni Zan's (1306–1374) art. Dong Qichang regarded Ni's painting as a calligraphic abstraction of the tenth-century master Dong Yuan's style and used Dong Yuan's ""hemp-fiber"" texture strokes to re-create Ni Zan's brush landscape idiom."
Seven_Sages_of_the_Bamboo_Grove,"In a bamboo grove surrounded by pine trees and rocks, four men listen to a friend play the zither. Nearby, a man washes his feet in the stream as a seventh and final companion approaches on a dirt path. These are the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, men of the third century who retreated from the chaos of society to cultivate themselves amid the quietude of nature. Secluded from politics, they played music, drank wine, and conversed about lofty subjects. They were frequently depicted by artists in a variety media."
Daoist_divine_official,"This figure of a Daoist deity is embellished with low-fired lead glaze colors typical of Ming religious ceramic sculptures made in Shanxi Province. An inscription on the back indicates that a certain Daoist priest ordered three sets of sculptures for his monastery in the Tiantan Mountains of Shanxi. Chief among these was a set of the Three Divine Officials (sanguan), Daoist deities who preside over heaven, earth, and water, respectively. The clothing on this sculpture helps to identify it as one of the three officials, though which one is uncertain."
Ruyi,"Ai’s reinterpretation of a ruyi (wish fulfillment) scepter, an emblem of longevity and good fortune, recontextualizes its traditional iconography to insinuate new layers of meaning. The ruyi’s form is derived from a mushroom-shaped fungus that for more than two millennia was thought to confer immortality. Ai’s scepter riffs on this belief by making its health-granting properties anatomically specific. Composed of ceramic human organs, Ai’s scepter calls to mind not long life but humankind’s physical vulnerability."
Round-backed_Armchair,"This pair of armchairs belong to Shao’s Chair series in which historic Ming-style forms are transformed into sleek, sometimes surreal, modern hybrids using contemporary forms, techniques, and materials. These works not only illuminate aesthetic connections across time and culture, but also demonstrate how China’s past can both adapt to and coexist with its rapidly changing and increasingly globalized present."
Study_for_Ink_Handscroll,"This study illuminates Liu’s process in creating the monumental, convoluted vision Ink Handscroll, on view on your right. Liu began by squaring a small pencil sketch transfer to the full-size scroll, which he affixed to the walls of his studio. He used thread stretched between pins to recreate the grid at a larger scale and then transferred the design using faint ink lines or dots. Only then did Liu begin the slow process of filling in the forms with texture strokes and pale washes."
"Plants,_Flowers,_and_Birds","These small-scale tracings of book illustrations must date from very early in Xie's career, before he had access to original works."
Round-backed_Armchair,"This pair of armchairs belong to Shao’s Chair series in which historic Ming-style forms are transformed into sleek, sometimes surreal, modern hybrids using contemporary forms, techniques, and materials. These works not only illuminate aesthetic connections across time and culture, but also demonstrate how China’s past can both adapt to and coexist with its rapidly changing and increasingly globalized present."
The_Cassia_Grove_Studio,"Wen Zhengming painted The Cassia Grove Studio to celebrate the success of a fellow scholar, Zheng Zichong, at passing the civil-service examination. ""Plucking the cassia"" was a metaphor for such success. A fall flower, the cassia was usually associated with the provincial examinations, traditionally held in the autumn. The red vine leaves identify this as an autumnal scene.The painting presents Zheng Zichong in his garden. Half hidden by the wall of his studio, he appears in rapt contemplation of the scenery. The rustic structures and fence indicate the simple but elegant taste of the Ming scholar; a cabinet full of scrolls visible through the window shows his appreciation of the arts. As both a depiction of a garden studio and a portrait of its owner, Wen's gemlike painting portrays the pleasures of a scholarly life devoted to the arts and to the pursuit of learning."
"Lotus,_Rock,_and_Flower_Study,_after_Chen_Hongshou","Here, Xie traced a Chen Hongshou (1599–1652) composition of a lotus and a rock, including the signature ""Hongshou."" Afterward, he reused the same paper to copy an unrelated flowering branch."
"Butterfly,_Bamboo,_Flowers,_and_Rock,_after_Chen_Hongshou",Both the subject matter of this composition and the style of the angular rocks and bladelike leaves identify this drawing as a derivation after a model by Chen Hongshou.
"Figure_Studies,_Two_Figures_in_a_Boat","Here, Xie has created a pictorial lexicon of figure types by tracing images from earlier sources. This method of grouping similar motifs closely resembles the organizational approach of the famous seventeenth-century Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual."
"Gentleman_Seated_at_a_Stone_Table,_after_Chen_Hongshou","This tracing, which is based on a composition that Chen Hongshou (1599–1652) reused several times, illustrates how professional painters in China have long used copybooks and models to facilitate the replication of images."
Landscape_Sketches_and_Tree,This remarkable drawing from an album of landscape sketches demonstrates Xie's interest in learning directly from nature.
"Bird,_Blossoming_Plum,_and_Rock,_after_Chen_Hongshou","When Xie copied Chen Hongshou's (1599–1652) paintings,he typically transcribed the artist's inscriptions as well. The inscription accompanying this drawing reads: ""Laochi [Chen's style name], Hongshou painted this in the Studio of Willow Bridge."""
"Camellia_and_Rock,_after_Chen_Hongshou","This tracing replicates Chen Hongshou's original painting and its inscription, which reads ""gengwu"" (1630). Xie drew a very similar camellia in the album on view in this gallery."
"Blossoming_Plum,_after_Chen_Hongshou","Xie's admiration for Chen Hongshou (1599–1652) extended to the master's elegant calligraphy. As a result, Xie made a point of transcribing Chen's inscriptions whenever he copied the artist's pictorial compositions."
Palace_Halls_and_Waves,"These intricate ruled-line drawings of ancient architecture were probably traced from paintings. The photograph mounted below the drawing, made prior to restoration, illustrates the challenges of conserving the thin, brittle paper Xie favored for making tracing copies, particularly those sheets that were folded, creased, and, at times, torn."
Mount_Tongjun_and_the_Tianmu_Stream,"Xie's inscriptions identify this scene as the left side of Mount Tongjun, near the Tianmu Stream, in northwest Zhejiang province. The inclusion of a bus by the ferryboat crossing reflects Xie's commitment to depicting the site's contemporary reality."
Studies_of_a_Bee,"These tiny studies could only have been made from an actual bee, perhaps one that had recently died. They are accompanied by Xie's handwritten notes on color."
"West_Lake,_Hangzhou:_Little_Isle_of_the_Immortals","In the lower left corner of this sheet, Xie recorded the poetic four-character phrase ""Winding Path to Obscure Sites,"" which had been inscribed onto a plaque by Kang Youwei (1858–1927) to describe this particular spot."
Recluse_playing_the_zither_in_a_pine_grove,"Wen Zhengming was the most influential Suzhou painter of the sixteenth century. He created his own immortality with his dogged determination to excel, his dozens of students, and an unusually long life of prodigious artistic production. In Playing the Qin in the Shade of the Pines, one of Wen's largest works, the freely executed boulders and impressionistically rendered trees coalesce into powerful interlocking forms when viewed, as intended, from across a spacious hall. The scroll is roughly contemporaneous with Wen's equally large calligraphic scrolls of the late 1520s, which were commissioned by the Jiajing emperor (r. 1522–66).Playing the seven-string zither (qin), a versatile instrument able to suggest nature's sounds, is associated with the solitary self-cultivation and reclusive existence of the scholar. A seventeenth-century qin is on display in the Ming Room of the Astor Court."
Bamboo,"This sketch illustrates Xie's interest in studying actual specimens of bamboo. Nonetheless, the regularized lines of the stalks and joints reflect his familiarity with traditional ""double-outline"" renderings, which served as the basis for his translation of nature into art."
Drunken_fisherman_by_a_reed_bank,"The fisherman, symbol of the scholar in retirement, is drunk and fast asleep under the awning of his boat, oblivious to the cares of the world. Tang Yin expands upon the meaning of his painting in the accompanying poem:Punting pole stuck in the reeds, he ties up his skiff;Late at night, the moon climbs to the top of the pole.The old fisherman is dead drunk, call him, he won't wake up,In the morning he rises, frost-prints on the shadow of his raincoat.(Jonathan Chaves, trans., ""Some Relationships Between Poetry and Painting in China,"" Renditions, vol. 6 [1976], p. 90)"
Record_of_the_Following_One's_Ancestor_Studio,"This text, written when scholars living in retirement became intimately identified with their gardens or studios, is a rare fourteenth-century example of a new literary genre, the ""studio memoir."" But as Zheng's brief postscript makes clear, the essay was also intended to function as a letter of introduction for its recipient, an aspiring young student named Xu Huan. In the postscript, Zheng asks Xu Huan to show the scroll to a high-ranking official who might help Xu with an appointment. By adopting the form of a studio history in his essay, Zheng is able to discuss Xu Huan's illustrious family background and virtuous intentions while maintaining a tasteful and face-saving indirectness.The elegance of Zheng Yuanyou's calligraphy reflects the refined sensibilities of both the writer and the recipient. Zheng was among the first to develop a distinctive new calligraphic style of elongated characters and exaggerated turning strokes and hooks that was based on late Han dynasty archaic models. This antiestablishment style is commonly associated with Zheng's most famous pupil, the recluse-artist Ni Zan (1306–1374), who made it synonymous with scholars living in retirement. Zheng's early use of this style suggests that it was not Ni's personal invention but a widespread cultural phenomenon expressive of the reclusive spirit of the times."
"Remote_Valleys,_Sounds_of_Waterfalls,_Deep_Forests","Liu Yu, a Nanjing native, is not listed among the Eight Masters of Jinling (Nanjing), but he belonged to the same circle of leading collectors and artists active in the city during the late seventeenth century, when it was a vital center for the arts. Liu developed an eclectic style that combined the dry, linear brushwork of the Nanjing individualist Gong Xian (1619–1689) with the landscape forms and brush idioms of the Orthodox master Wang Hui (1632–1717). Liu further enlivened his integration of stylistic sources with playful shifts in scale and spatial distortions—visual effects intended to convey his ""scholarly amateurism."" Like other Nanjing masters of the time, Liu balanced his commitment to calligraphic abstraction with the desire to make his pictures visually appealing.Here, alternating familiar scenes of human habitation with dramatic depictions of natural scenery, he created a landscape that engages viewers and transports them to another world."
"Rhythm_of_the_Street,_from_the_series_Life_in_the_Big_City","Wang Qi and other printmakers turned to modernism in the 1980s, leaving behind the propagandist art of previous decades. In this print he illustrates busy urban life without explicit ideological messages. This is the second of seven prints in the series Life in the Big City (1985–87), inspired by the 1925 woodcut series The City by the Belgian artist Frans Masereel (1889–1972)."
"Dancing,_from_the_series_Highland_Barley","This and the two adjacent prints form a series on Tibetan rural life, partly based on the artist’s experience there in the 1950s. Here, peasants in local costumes dance happily in the fields, approached by a procession carrying a poster of Chairman Mao. Like most of Zhao’s work at this time, shortly after a failed uprising in Tibet, the series served political functions. In addition, agricultural abundance was an important Communist propaganda theme.These three prints of exceptionally high quality were made with several woodblocks using both water-based and oil-based inks."
Raging_Tide_I:_Struggle,"The pathetically strained bodies, set against an open vista of despairingly barren land, seem frozen in agony. The print is deeply indebted in its subject and composition to the Peasants’ War series by the German Expressionist K?the Kollwitz (1867–1945). Yet Li Hua achieved an even greater visual intensity by maximizing light effects and employing engraving techniques.Li Hua assumed a leadership role in the first stage of the Modern Woodcut Movement in the early 1930s, creating some of the most iconic woodblock prints of the prewar period. His early fascination with German Expressionism lasted into his mature work."
"Underground_Palace,_from_the_series_Ancient_Capital:_Beijing","Wang Weixin’s print series Ancient Capital: Beijing depicts the city’s landmarks. Below the sculpture-lined “spirit way” leading to the imperial tombs is an underground palace with walls built of skulls and skeletons. The composition’s rigorous symmetry and architectonic monumentality effortlessly conjures up the grandeur of the Forbidden City.Trained in the art academies at Hangzhou and Beijing, Wang Weixin experiments with various techniques, such as etching, watercolor, and embossing, to achieve innovative graphic effects. This series exemplifies his ingenuity."
"Palace_Museum,_from_the_series_Ancient_Capital:_Beijing","Wang Weixin’s print series Ancient Capital: Beijing depicts the city’s landmarks. This work features the Palace Museum in the former Forbidden City. Under the symbols of the sun and the moon, the entire compound is meticulously laid out along a central axis. The bottom register of the composition presents an array of selected masterpieces in the collection in various media, including painting, calligraphy, sculpture, bronze, and woodblock print. Trained in the art academies at Hangzhou and Beijing, Wang Weixin experiments with various techniques, such as etching, watercolor, and embossing, to achieve innovative graphic effects. This series exemplifies his ingenuity."
Morning_on_the_Huangpu_River,"This print depicts the dawning of a busy day on the Huangpu River in Shanghai. Small traditional boats in the foreground, rendered in bold outlines with flashes of bright colors, contrast with modern industrial ships and Shanghai’s majestic skyline in the misty distance. Shao Keping was born in Zhejiang and trained in Shanghai. Much of his earlier work was propagandist in nature. Even after artistic censorship loosened in the early 1960s, he continued to reflect the positive sides of life under the Communist government."
Burning_up_Land_Deeds,"This print commemorates the Communist land reform of 1946, when land was taken away from its owners and distributed among peasants. The excitement of the liberated peasants and the village commune manifests itself in leaping flames and swirling clouds rendered in dramatic black-and-white contrasts.Gu Yuan did not receive formal training in printmaking until 1938, when he arrived in Yan’an and attended the newly founded Lu Xun Institute of Literature and Art. This work is representative of his early style."
Fragrant_Snow_at_Broken_Bridge,"An ambitious scholar, Wang Mian was determined to fulfill his responsibilities as a man of talent despite the frustrations and dangers of life under Mongol rule. He studied philosophy, military tactics and politics. He wrote poems and government treatises, drew up battle plans and painted unforgettable images of the flowering plum that became the principal model for plum painters of Ming and Qing times.In this painting, Wang Main brought into balance the expressive and representational elements of his subject, for in depicting silken blossoms and rough branches, he employed both the delicately descriptive techniques of his academic predecessors and the bold calligraphic brushwork of his literati contemporaries.The flowering plum (Prunus mume, or Japanese apricot) became an object of intense enthusiasm during the Southern Song dynasty and has remained one of China's favorite motifs. Blooming before all other trees, it was welcomed as the harbinger of spring. By Wang Mian's time, under the impact of the barbarian Mongol rule, the image of the flowering plum blossoming in the withered winter landscape, had become a powerful symbol of purity and endurance in adversity."
Guanyin,"This ink rubbing preserves an image of a stone carving based on a painting. According to the inscription, the original painting was made by an artist named Zhou Xun; the stone carvers and the donor are also identified. Borne aloft by clouds, draped in flowing robes and ornate jewels, and crowned by an elaborate headdress, merciful Guanyin rides to rescue the faithful."
Lu_Xun_and_Uchiyama_at_the_Woodblock-Printing_Class,"This print commemorates the historic event that is widely considered to have initiated the Modern Woodcut Movement in China. In August 1931, Lu Xun (1881–1936), arguably the most influential cultural figure in China’s revolution, organized a six-day workshop in woodcuts whose thirteen participants received instruction from Uchiyama Kakichi (1900–1984). Lu Xun remains the inspiration for, and the subject of, numerous black-andwhite woodcuts.Gan Zhenglun was born in Beijing. He graduated from the National Academy of Fine Arts in Hangzhou in 1957 and taught there for many years."
Fleeting_Years,"This print is the first in a series of four illustrating daily life in the canal cities of Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces. River dwelling, a traditional subject, is here interpreted with contemporary people and buildings. Inserted in a white patch are female weavers at work, a theme copied from Ming (1368–1644) and Qing dynasty (1644–1911) prints illustrating “women’s ten chores.”White patches are used to simulate the effect of printing with worn-out blocks, as the carved surface suffers losses through time."
Field_Master,"The Modern Prints Society, formed in Guangzhou in 1934, was the most productive and longest lasting among the woodcut groups that sprang up across China in the 1930s. The first issue of the magazine Modern Prints appeared in December 1934; eighteen issues were published in the following year and a half. Except for the first, only fifty handmade copies were printed of each issue.In the spring of 1935, the magazine dedicated two issues to the subject of folk customs to bring an avowedly democratic art form to bear on the life of ordinary people. This print by Lai Shaoqi graced the cover of the May issue."
Landscapes,"Shangrui was a Buddhist monk painter who specialized in the types of historically informed landscape paintings seen in this album. Though biographical sources for the artist are scarce, those that survive state that he studied with Wang Hui, the leading landscape painter of the late seventeenth century, during his time in Beijing. According to the date of 1672, this album should date to before Shangrui’s encounter with Wang Hui, but already one can see a shared interest in old master styles, especially the blue-green landscape manner associated with painters such as Zhao Mengfu and Zhao Boju."
Bamboo_in_wind_and_rain,"Shitao, one of the most outstanding landscape masters of his time, was also passionately in love with bamboo painting. On this monumental work, he quotes a description by Su Che (1039–1112) of Wen Tong (1018–1079), the Northern Song bamboo painter: ""He dallies amid bamboo in the morning, stays in the company of bamboo in the evening, drinks and eats amid the bamboo, and rests and sleeps in the shade of bamboo; having observed all the different aspects of the bamboo, he then exhausts all the bamboo's many transformations.""Accompanying Shitao's signature is his seal, which quotes a saying by Wen Tong: ""How can I live one day without this gentleman!""During the eighteenth,century, Shitao's style of bamboo painting was practiced by members of the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou."
Discourse_on_Painting,"Fa Ruozhen served as a government official during the Ming dynasty; after the fall of the Ming, he broke with his compatriots, many of whom remained loyal to the defeated dynasty, to serve in the newly established Qing government. This handscroll, which he titled Discourse on Painting, is not a technical treatise but rather a reflective essay on what sort of person should pursue the art of painting. The highest good, says Fa, is to pursue service to society through government. If, however, one is unskilled in practical affairs, one should then study the classics; only if one fails at that should one pursue the life of a painter. Fa knew of what he wrote: he not only served in government but also painted."
Winter_landscapes_and_flowers,"Qian Weicheng was one of the foremost Orthodox School landscapists and flower painters of the eighteenth century. Enjoying a brilliant official career, Qian rose to the rank of vice-president of the Board of Works. At the same time, the Qianlong emperor considered him to be one of the outstanding painters of the age. In over twenty years' service at court, Qian Weicheng produced more than 275 paintings for the emperor. Even after Qian's death in 1772, the emperor continued, as on this album, to add appreciative inscriptions.This album originally formed part of a four-volume set depicting scenery and flowers of the four seasons. Representing the varied faces of winter, the twelve paintings in the album alternate between the soft grays and muted colors of wintry landscapes and the intense colors of seasonal flowers."
Meditation_in_a_Cave,"Ren Yu was the youngest of the Four Rens, but he nevertheless was able to create his own distinctive style of painting. In this emotionally charged landscape, a monk-like figure sits calmly within the recesses of a jagged overhanging cliff that fills the height of the picture. An opening in the mountain directly over his head may represent the radiance of Buddhist enlightenment."
Landscape_in_the_style_of_Huang_Gongwang,"This major work represents the culmination of Wang Shimin’s lifelong study of the paintings of Huang Gongwang (1269–1354). Reducing Huang’s calligraphic style to a graphic formula—rock forms filled with straight, parallel, “hemp-fiber” texture strokes and layers of horizontal dots—Wang Shimin built his kinetic brush patterns into rising and falling, opening and closing, “breath-force” (qishi) movements. Individual texture strokes and foliage dots crisscross, multiplying and expanding until the entire composition turns into a great flowing pattern of undulating forces and counterforces that suggests nature’s boundless energy and growth.Wang Shimin was the eldest of the “Four Wangs”—the others being Wang Jian (1598–1677), Wang Hui (1632–1717), and Wang Yuanqi (1642–1715). They were the leaders of the Orthodox school of painting in the early Qing period."
Landscape_in_the_Style_of_Guo_Xi,"Except for this painting, there are no other known references to the artist Tan Song. According to his inscription, he was inspired by the brush idiom of the eleventh-century landscape master Guo Xi. But it is clear from the painting’s style, content, and date that Tan was a close follower of Yuan Jiang (act. 1680–1730) and Yuan Yao (act. 1730–after 1778) and may well have assisted them in the family studio. Tan’s painting is modeled on similar compositions by both of the Yuans that also invoke Guo Xi as their stylistic source and similarly feature heavily laden ox carts moving through the mountains. Yet in his eagerness to emulate these masters, Tan Song has created a caricature of their manner. In Tan’s hands the Yuans’ exuberant style of brushwork for defining landscape features has become a frothy profusion of nervous squiggles and curlicues that no longer describe substantial forms. The same tendency toward overelaboration is also apparent in the profusion of narrative elements and genre details that Tan has scattered throughout his composition, including two oxcarts whose illogical destination seems to be the crest of the central peak."
Couplet_on_an_Autumn_Sky,"Lizong was the finest calligrapher among the Song emperors who came after Gaozong (r. 1127–62). While his predecessors followed Gaozong's style, Lizong developed his own unique manner, which was distinguished by angular brushstrokes with straight rapid brush movements—in contrast to the slower, more rounded brushstrokes of Gaozong—and by his preference for Tang, rather than Jin, dynasty models.This couplet may well describe the beauty of West Lake, site of the Southern Song imperial palace:Deep in the autumn, waters are clear to the bottom [of the lake],After rain, blueness extends across the sky."
Searching_for_Fungus,"This painting depicts a gentleman holding a lingzhi fungus, a popular emblem of longevity. According to the inscription, the fan was created as a gift for the seventieth birthday of a Mr. Ruoyu."
Paragons_of_Loyalty_and_Filial_Piety,"Illustrations of historical paragons of piety and loyalty have been an important method of transmitting those virtues since at least the Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 220). In the eleventh century, the scholar-artist Li Gonglin (ca. 1041–1106) gave new meaning to this tradition with his Classic of Filial Piety, in which simple monochrome drawings not only illustrate the text but also present subtle commentaries on contemporary society. In this painting, Wang Shanggong, a little-known artist from Suzhou, reinvigorated the role of artist as social critic by reviving the Li Gonglin tradition in both subject matter and style. Living under the rule of the Wanli emperor (r. 1573–1620), who refused to come to court for the last twenty-five years of his reign, Wang presented interpretations of important themes, such as officials admonishing their ruler and the emperor receiving his ministers, which must have held particular significance for his contemporaries. Wang's extraordinarily fine baimiao (plain-drawing) style was inspired by the monochrome drawing method of Li Gonglin but attained a new level of gossamer thinness and delicacy that anticipates the stylistic innovations of such better-known late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century artists as Ding Yunpeng, Wu Bin, and Chen Hongshou."
Enjoying_the_Wilderness_in_an_Autumn_Grove,"Until the early 1340s, Ni Zan lived the life of a wealthy dilettante, spending his time among the precious books, antiques, and flowers of his Pure and Secluded Pavilion. His painting style at the time, as seen here, exhibits a studied archaism in which his interest in descriptive detail is at odds with his self-conscious use of calligraphic ""hemp fiber"" brushstrokes in the manner of tenth-century masters. Ni's gentleman seated in a rustic pavilion is shorthand for the scholar in his studio. His florid poem exhibits a similarly precious quality of one entirely absorbed in his immediate surroundings. It reads, in part:In the bright days, bamboo wave in the breeze;In the dark nights, parasols of fir hold up the moon.Burning incense I use [a censer in the form of] a gilded duck;Gathering scattered petals, I place them inside my pillow.(trans. Wen Fong)"
"Autumn_Landscape,_leaf_from_Album_for_Zhou_Lianggong","This painting and its accompanying inscription belonged to an album made for the noted Nanjing collector and high official Zhou Lianggong (1612–1672). A leading patron of contemporary artists, Zhou assembled a number of these albums during the last twenty-five years of his life, when his career required him to travel extensively. Such collaborative works have long been a means for a group of artists to commemorate special occasions, but Zhou’s albums, which sometimes encompassed hundreds of contributions, fulfilled a different function: they included works by professionals and scholar-amateurs, Ming loyalists and Qing officials, traditionalist orthodox painters and innovative individualists. By inviting a wide spectrum of artists to both view and contribute to these albums, Zhou created a unique forum for artists to learn from and appraise one another’s productions."
Herbaceous_Peony,"This peony fan shows the blending of literati and popular tastes in the period. Literati artists traditionally disdained a gold ground as vulgar, but Hu uses it to set off his image of the luscious peony, a flower with associations of wealth and seductive beauty."
Returning_Fishermen,"The paintings of Tang Di, a scholar and official at the Yuan court, range from ink drawings on paper to largescale colored works on silk. A fellow townsman and follower of the scholar-painter Zhao Mengfu (1257–1322), Tang won praise from Emperor Renzong (r. 1312–20) for his part in the decoration of the Yuan imperial palace.Returning Fisherman is a fine example of Tang Di's monumental decorative style. Tang executed the scroll in the conservative brush idiom of the Northern Song masters Li Cheng (919–967) and Guo Xi (ca. 1000–ca. 1090), building forms with the principal motifs of the earlier style, ""crab-claw"" branches and ""billowing-cloud"" rocks. Following Zhao Mengfu's example of employing calligraphic techniques in painting, Tang made each brushstroke assertive."
Eight_landscapes,"Almost nothing is known of Lu Han, the painter of this album, but the style of the landscapes indicates he studied the work of his contemporary Wang Hui (1632–1717). The album is notable for the layers of significance encoded in the images: not only is each leaf in the style of a different well-known painter, but many of them also depict historical events, such as the fourth-century Gathering at the Orchid Pavilion, or famous works of literature, such as the “Ode to the Pavilion of the Inebriated Old Man” by Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072)."
"Spring_River,_Level_Distance,_after_Jiang_Shen","This fan by the modern painter Zhu Zhuyun gives a sense of how the other fans in this room were originally mounted. The painting is attached to stiff ribs, in this case made of bamboo, which allow the fan to open and close as the paper folds. For the outer covers of this example, the mounter used striking pieces of mottled bamboo native to southern China."
"Bamboo,_old_tree,_and_rock","This painting shows Wu Zhen's creative adaptation of the ""old tree, bamboo, and rock"" genre first canonized by eleventh-century scholar-artists. The painting's large scale and use of overlapping forms and graded ink tones to create an illusion of recession, and of rich, wet ink to evoke the appearance of foliage after a drenching rain, recall the descriptive naturalism of Song-dynasty precedents. But Wu tempered this naturalistic approach with a new calligraphic assertiveness inspired by the work of Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322). Bamboo leaves have been reduced to a calligraphic formula of repeating, pattern-like clusters, and the texture strokes and foliage dots used to describe rock surfaces have become emphatic mannerisms derived from the tenth-century masters Dong Yuan and Juran.In his later years, Wu Zhen specialized in bamboo painting, but even here, in his earliest extant depiction of bamboo, the artist's admiration for this plant is evident, particularly in his poetic inscription:Tall stalks pierce the clouds.Perhaps you find it strange,Not recognizing the wings of a phoenix.A pure sound enters the realm of the soundless,Do not let Zhonglang blow his long-necked flute."
"West_Lake,_Hangzhou:_Boats_and_the_Baoshu_Pagoda","As a young artist, Xie made a number of excursions from Shanghai, during which he sketched the natural environment. One of his early outings took him to nearby Hangzhou, where he made a number of faithful drawings of the scenery at West Lake, including this view of the hills along the northern shore."
Landscapes_in_the_styles_of_old_masters,"Gao Cen was among the most accomplished of the so-called Eight Masters of Nanjing. He specialized in small-scale gemlike paintings executed in an intricate, descriptive style that highlighted the scenery of the city. Perpetuating a tradition of topographic painting practiced during the late Ming, Gao produced works to supply the growing demand for mementos of Nanjing's fabled sights, including places with nostalgic links to the city's glory days under the Ming. A sensitive recorder of the familiar, Gao was also an innovative experimenter with light, atmosphere, and color whose art reflects a creative response to Western influences introduced by Jesuits such as Matteo Ricci (1552–1610). Gao's wistful, atmospheric landscapes are noteworthy for seamlessly fusing descriptive realism and poetic feeling to achieve exquisite evocations of place and mood.Gao's works are rare today and this album, which captures aspects of Nanjing's scenery at different times of year and in varied weather conditions, is one of his finest. Dated to the peak period of his career, it combines lyrical suggestions of actual scenery with an evocation of antique styles."
Poems_and_Notes_on_Painting,"Here, Xie has written drafts for several poems interspersed with comments on paintings and calligraphy. As some poems refer to scenic places in Sichuan province, such as Mount Emei, Xie may have composed the poems between 1938 and 1945, when he was living in the Sichuan city of Chongqing. The name of Xie's residence, ""Bitter Bamboo Studio"" (Kuhuang Zhai), is printed on each page."
"West_Lake,_Hangzhou:_View_toward_the_Little_Isle_of_the_Immortals","On this sheet, Xie's layering of the foreground, middle ground, and far distance may have been an attempt to construct a composition using the traditional ""three distances."" According to Xie's inscription, this is a view from the site of the former Leifeng Pagoda, which had collapsed in 1924, toward the island called ""Reflections of the Moon in Three Ponds."""
Old_pine,Pine and rock are paired to create a quiet but sturdy image of constancy and persistence. This painting was created by the celebrated scholar-artist Wen Zhengming and later inscribed by his son Wen Jia with an eleventh-century poem about pine trees. Pines were a common subject for birthday-gift paintings; the elder Wen may have painted this one in advance and never found the occasion to inscribe it for a recipient.
Sutra_Cover_with_Pattern_of_Lingzhi_Fungus_topped_by_the_Chinese_Character_Shou_(longevity);,Sutra cover with repeating pattern of offset rows of lingzhi fungus topped by the Chinese character shou (longevity); yellow on a red background. Silk twill damask in two colors.
Studies_of_Boats_and_Figures,"On this sheet, Xie has assembled clean tracing copies from a number of preliminary sketches. This two-step process is key to understanding the artist's working method. Xie would first draw a subject in pencil or charcoal then either go over the sketch in ink or, as here, make a tracing copy. In so doing, Xie could refine and perfect his design, concentrating on making his individual brushstrokes beautiful."
Strolling_in_a_Misty_Valley,"Mei Qing was born into a prominent family in Xuancheng, Anhui Province, about seventy-five miles south of Nanjing. Mei followed the family tradition of scholarship. By age sixteen he had become a prefectural-level student (zhusheng), and in 1642 he published his first collection of poems. He lived in retirement during the first decade of the Qing dynasty.Strolling in a Misty Valley is Mei’s earliest extant work, done shortly after he moved to a new family residence in a scenic area south of Xuancheng. The painting shows him working in the dry, linear style typical of a number of late Ming painters, with angular rock formations and craggy pines loosely organized along a serpentine stream. Its style vaguely recalls the landscape forms of Huang Gongwang (1269–1354) and the spare brush idiom of Ni Zan (1306–1374). Painted just five years after the fall of the Ming dynasty, its allusions to these recluse-artists, who lived under the Mongol Yuan dynasty, clearly signal Mei’s own situation and loyalist sentiments.Above the peaks, Mei inscribed a poem and dedication:In the valley clouds and mist often obscure one’s view,I am pleased that the pines and rocks in front of my door are peaceful.My song over, I drag my staff along as I cross the stream;My picture captures the green mountains, I look upon it with satisfaction.On an autumn day in the jichou year [1649],I present this to my teacher Old Li for his instruction.The Daoist of Qushan, Mei Qing"
Waterfall_on_a_Cold_Cliff,"Lu Hui was introduced to great collections of art by his patron Wu Dacheng, and became a renowned connoisseur himself. In his inscription, Lu cites the “brush-concept” of the fourteenth-century artist Wu Zhen as his inspiration, but the image bears only a distant relationship to the earlier painter. Wu was known for building his landscape forms out of bold ink tones so that brushwork became the center of attention. Some of these “brush-ideas” are evident in Lu’s painting, but there is also a sense of naturalism visible in his attention to light and shadow in the waterfall."
Listening_to_a_Speech_in_Yan’an,"In its volumetric forms rendered through contrasting areas of light and dark, this print reflects Liqun’s background in Western-style painting. The subject matter of a new kind of femininity and motherhood, however, is revolutionary. While nursing her baby, the female soldier clad in a uniform listens intently to something outside the picture frame and takes notes. As the title indicates, she is absorbed in a broadcast speech in Yan’an, the Communist power base in northwest China.Liqun began his artistic career at the China National Art Academy in Hangzhou in 1931. By 1940, he had found his way to Yan’an, where he became an instructor at the Lu Xun Institute of Literature and Art."
Landscapes_after_old_masters,"In the waning years of the eighteenth century, the city of Zhenjiang gave rise to a new painting movement that would become one of the most vital forces in the visual arts of the late Qing dynasty. While sharing their contemporaries’ interest in studying old master styles, the painters of Zhenjiang brought their own sensibility to this practice, foregrounding patternization and a bold approach to surface texture. This album by Pan Gongshou, one of the founders of the school, shows him cycling through old masters both familiar and unknown, bringing a fresh new voice to a centuries-old discipline."
Joys_of_the_Fisherman,"A twelfth-century couplet inscribed on the wall of a tavern characterized the lives of the fisherman and the scholar-official:Right and wrong reach not where men fish;Glory and disgrace dog the official riding his horse.To painters living in the tumultuous days of the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties, the theme of the fisherman symbolized a perfect escape from their strife-torn world. Wang Fu, a fellow townsman of Ni Zan (1306–1374), returned to Wuxi in 1401, after twenty years of exile at the desolate northern outpost of Datong, Shanxi Province; like Ni Zan, he had been a wanderer in his native land. In this long scroll Wang echoes Wu Zhen's (1280–1354) treatment of the fisherman theme. Poised between descriptive realism and calligraphic abstraction, Wang's painting exemplifies how Ming- and Qing-dynasty scholar-artists expressed themselves through the brush idioms of the Song and Yuan masters."
Bringing_the_Message_of_Victory_to_Dongshan,"This painting depicts Xie An, the celebrated official and military strategist of the Eastern Jin dynasty. A famous story tells how Xie An was informed of a major military victory while playing chess with a friend; he was so absorbed in the game that he offered no perceptible reaction to this important news."
Beauty_about_to_bathe,"Partially clad in a diaphanous robe, a woman with an elaborate coiffure perches on the edge of a bamboo couch. A red candle burning in a sconce indicates that the time is evening. A basin of blossoming orchids at her right may symbolize hidden beauty, seductive fragrance, or scholarly talent, while the books at the woman’s right elbow bespeak her learning. At bottom left, a bath is being filled, seemingly by an unseen attendant who assists from offstage.The picture is risqué in several respects. The sheer robe, decorated with a translucent pattern of bamboo, reveals much of the woman’s body, including her breasts and legs. Her bound feet—a highly charged erotic theme in premodern Chinese literature and art—are emphasized by her red shoes. More subtle but perhaps equally outré is the open-mouthed expression of the beauty, which reveals her bare teeth, an exceptionally rare and provocative feature for a premodern Chinese figure painting."
Dew-Moistened_Pearls,"Flowering wisteria vines were a favorite subject of Wu Changshuo, who reveled in painting the wildly tangled vines and cascading bundles of blossoms. Wu was a leading figure of the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Shanghai School of painting, which built on historical precedents to fashion a bold manner of bright colors and saturated applications of ink and pigment."
Red_Cliffs_and_Green_Valleys,"Wang Meng’s grandfather Zhao Mengfu was one of the first artists to make landscape paintings that referred knowingly to earlier styles. This idea, simple on its face but revolutionary in its impact, required not just a knowledge of art history but the ability to forge something new out of it, and it became the dominant mode for ambitious landscape painters going forward. This intimately scaled hanging scroll shows Wang Meng working in this vein, using ropy texturing brushstrokes and vigorous dotting to refer to elements of his grandfather’s style and to those still-earlier painters who had inspired it."
"Hawk,_pine,_plum,_and_rock","Zhu Cheng painted in Shanghai in the waning years of the Qing dynasty. At a time when China’s position on the world stage had been weakened, images of birds of prey became more popular. Artists and patrons looked to inject a sense of strength into the ink-painting tradition through these symbols of martial power. The hawk stands stolidly on a wizened old pine as flowering plum—a sign of spring renewal—blossoms below."
“Plucking_Pollia_on_a_Fragrant_Isle”,"This seal is engraved with 2,765 miniscule characters on its three sides, transcribing the poetic classic “Li Sao” (On Encountering Sorrow) by Qu Yuan (343–278 B.C.)."
"Oh,_Changbai_Mountain!","This painting depicts the dense primeval forest that Fu encountered on his way to the snow-covered Changbai Mountain—barely visible between the tall pine trees. Despite the many hours traveling in the “never-ending pine-tree hutong [alleys],” Fu was eager and excited to ascend the mountain."
One_Thousand_Mountains_Vying_for_Beauty,"Fu’s late landscapes reflect both his direct encounter with nature and his continuing use of traditional artistic devices. Here, the deep vista, defined by layered ranks of mountains rendered in progressively paler shades of ink, reflects Song dynasty (960–1279) principles for how to suggest recession."
Myriad_Green_Mountains,"During the early 1980s Wu Zuoren produced a number of heroic images of eagles—a symbol of Confucian loyalty and imperial majesty—that would have been suitable as presentation pieces. This noble bird, perched on a pinnacle overlooking distant mountains, is accompanied by a monumental seal-script title that evokes associations of both patriotism and longevity.Wu used diluted ink dots to describe the birds' plumage. In this technique, each feather is defined by a single brush stroke in which the dark ink seeps to the outside perimeter of every dot."
Peony,"Zhao Zhiqian focused his commitment to calligraphic brushwork upon the genre of flower painting. Such images, with their sumptuous colors and symbolic associations with beauty, prosperity, and good fortune, appealed to the tastes of the new urban consumer. Zhao often painted on folding fans, a format popular during the later Ming and Qing dynasties, when fans became fashionable accoutrements for gentlemen.Peony, an image that connotes material prosperity and good fortune, introduces the boldness and simplicity of seal carving and early stone-carved scripts to painting. The forms of the blossom, leaves, and stem are artfully integrated with the curving shape of the fan."
Viewing_the_Tide,"Yang Yongliang’s photo collages combine the visual language of premodern landscape painting with digital techniques to engender moments of shock and surprise. Viewing the Tide faithfully follows the composition of Zhao Fu’s (active 12th century) Ten Thousand Li of the Yangzi River (Palace Museum, Beijing), but close examination reveals that the majestic mountains are composed of countless high-rise apartments, while the trees are actually power-line towers and construction cranes. In this dystopic vision of a landscape overrun by human development, the surging river at the end of the scroll seems to express nature’s wrath rather than her majesty—a tsunami come to sweep the excesses of humankind from the face of the earth."
Washing_a_Horse,This painting alludes to the lofty scholar-artist Ni Zan (1306–1374) and his obsession with cleanliness. But Fu’s depiction of this moral paragon may also be read as a metaphor for sweeping away worldly concerns in the pursuit of virtuous conduct and self-cultivation—ideals long cherished by literati artists.
Mountain_Dwelling,"Fu Baoshi strongly identified with the artist Shitao (1642–1707). In wartime Chongqing, Fu came to terms with economic hardship by likening his living environment to that of Shitao’s “humble cottage.” But it was Shitao’s innovative artistic spirit that inspired Fu in his quest for self-expression in painting."
View_from_the_Prague_Castle,"Fu’s inscription identifies this as a view of Prague Castle, but in fact his image highlights the spires of the Gothic cathedral of Saint Vitus as seen from the winding path lined with lampposts that leads up to the castle proper."
Poem_on_reclusion,"Poems of reclusion often celebrate country living, from the delights of physical labor to the passing of the seasons. In this poem written for Geng Jie (1622–1693), Zhou describes his friend as a gentleman-farmer who tends willows, chrysanthemums, and rice when he is not writing poetry to satisfy his creative spirit. Like Zhou, Geng was a prominent scholar-official, and times away from the pressures of government service were rare and precious."
The_Three_Gorges,"This superb painting of the Three Gorges of the Yangzi River captures the force, sweep, and flow of the river, and the light and atmosphere of the landscape. The distance, near and far, is well articulated with contrasting light and shade. An overall emphasis on the spatial relationship of motifs enhances the painting’s structural integration and pictorial unity."
Gazing_at_a_Waterfall,"Firsthand experience of different waterfalls during his northeast sketching tour of 1961 encouraged Fu to depict such sights. He might have incorporated modern figures to give the paintings a contemporary flavor, but to fulfill his personal need to express intimate emotions, Fu continued to use the conventional theme of ancient scholars looking at a waterfall."
Along_the_Road_to_Shanyin,"This simple, spare painting captures the pure delight of communing with nature. It is based on the comment by the renowned calligrapher Wang Xianzhi (344–386) about the beautiful scenery along the Shanyin road."
Drinking_Together_on_a_Pine-Covered_Cliff,"Fu’s inscription reads:Cheng Sui [1605–1691], “the commoner of Jiangdong” by sobriquet, modeled his landscapes after Dong Yuan [active 930s–960s], rendering them with dry brushstrokes. I favor his simple, vigorous style and imitate it. Baoshi.—Trans. Anita Chung"
The_First_Mountain_of_the_Long_March,"Yunshishan (Cloud Rock Mountain), in Ruijin, near the Fujian-Jiangxi border, is where the Long March (1934–36) began. The fantastic geological features and revolutionary connotations of the site attracted Fu’s attention."
Poem,"Yu Youren wrote this poem in the ""standardized"" cursive script that he developed in the 1930s. While benefiting from his solid discipline in the stele tradition of calligraphy, Yu's round brushwork brims with inner strength and taut resilience in a style that is more raw than refined. The center of structural gravity of individual characters tends to be lower than normal to enhance their stability. The principal horizontal, vertical, or diagonal stroke in each character exudes sweeping power and weight.Yu Youren's poetry in traditional genres ranks among the best in the Republican era. He insisted that poetry be easily accessible and employ rhyme schemes and tonal regulations used in modern Mandarin. In simple language, he invested his best works with intense emotions that are deeply moving but never sentimental such as the one transcribed here:I don't believe that youth cannot be retrieved.I will not allow our past glory to turn to ashes.Recalling the banquet in Shanghai celebrating our victory,I toast the ten thousand miles of streams and mountains with a cup of wine.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)"
Rats_and_a_Lamp,"Beneath an oil lamp, three rats scurry over a blue, cloth-bound book.The artist’s inscription reads:Rats would wish all people to be rich;The thought behind the wish is not selfless.In the dinghai year [1947], painted by the eighty-seven year old Baishi.--Translation by Keita Itoh and Lawrence Wu"
Landscape_in_the_Styles_of_Huang_Gongwang_and_Gao_Kegong,"The youngest of the ""Four Wangs,"" Wang Yuanqi knew both Wang Jian (1598–1677) and Wang Hui (1632–1717) and was tutored in painting by his grandfather Wang Shimin (1592–1680). Embarking on a career of government service at the age of twenty-nine, Wang gained official recognition as an artist in 1705, when he and four others were commanded by the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662–1722) to compile a comprehensive study on painting and calli-graphy, which was published in 1708 under the title Peiwenzhai shuhuapu. In this painting Wang draws inspiration from two Yuan dynasty masters, Huang Gongwang (1269–1354) and Gao Kegong (1248–1310)."
Autumn_Herd,"Li Keran's painting style changed in 1947, when he accepted a post at the National Art College in Beijing and became a pupil of faculty member Qi Baishi (1864–1957). Under Qi's influence, Li's drawing slowed down and began to display a round calligraphic quality. This depiction of water buffalo, one of Qi's favorite subjects, retains a cartoonlike simplicity and directness."
Gladioli,"The vibrant colors and abstraction of Gladioli suggest a Fauvist inspiration, but the translucent color washes that define the blossoms recall the traditional ""boneless"" technique of painting flowers without outline and the thrusting strokes of the leaves and the more methodically shaped petals reveal a calligraphic discipline not seen in the works of Matisse or other European artists. Lin's vision of flowers is charged with eruptive energy rather than domestic beauty."
Landscape_dedicated_to_Xiang_Yuanbian,"The second son of Wen Zhengming (1470–1559), Wen Jia followed the precedent of his father and his father's mentor, Shen Zhou (1427–1509), and developed a thorough mastery of the painting styles of the four great masters of the late Yuan dynasty. Here, Wen Jia re-created the style of the Yuan master Wu Zhen (1280–1354), with its softly contoured mountains defined in pale texture strokes set off by dark black foliage dots.Wen painted this work for the famous art collector Xiang Yuanbian (1525–1590). In his longer inscription he transcribed the text of Summer Song, composed by the poet and official Huangfu Fang (1503–1582). In his shorter inscription he dedicated the painting to Xiang on the occasion of Xiang's fifty-fourth birthday. Xiang's enthusiasm for the work is attested to by the presence of fifteen of his seals."
Hermit-Fisherman_on_a_Spring_River,"Known as the last major Zhe School professional painter, the Hangzhou artist Lan Ying was sufficiently influenced by late Ming scholar-painting aesthetics to have devoted most of his creative energy to painting in the idioms of the Song and Yuan masters. In this self-titled work, for example, Lan invokes the theme of life in reclusion celebrated in many paintings by Yuan scholar-artists.Unlike the works of the Wu School scholar-painters, however, Lan Ying’s paintings emphasize technical virtuosity and coloristic effects. Lan’s expressive drawing and bold use of color influenced a number of younger painters, including Chen Hongshou (1598–1652)."
Red_Friend,"Strangely faceted rocks—thought of as miniature mountains—have been treasured by collectors since the Tang dynasty (618–907). This portrait of a rock called Red Friend is painted without surrounding garden elements, freeing the viewer to imagine its setting."
Bodhisattva_Guanyin_in_the_Form_of_the_Buddha_Mother,"In Esoteric Buddhism, the Buddha is understood as having been born of the Law, which is regarded, therefore, as the Buddha Mother. This image depicts the Esoteric manifestation of Guanyin (Avalokiteshvara, in Sanskrit) as the Buddha Mother, a deity with multiple arms and a third ""all-seeing"" eye. In Chen Hongshou's interpretation, however, the Buddha Mother does not appear as a formidable incarnation of scripture but as a winsome young woman. Her unruly hairdo and the unconventional gesture of clutching strands of hair in her mouth may derive from heroines of contemporary popular theater rather than Buddhist iconography.This large-scale example of Chen Hongshou's early figure style is a rare complement to the small-scale figures in his early album paintings and woodblock prints. At this enlarged scale, Chen Hongshou's technique and idiosyncratic stylistic sources become readily apparent. His relaxed and fluid drapery lines do not follow the disciplined brush mannerisms of literati models but instead are derived from popular paintings and woodblock prints."
Untitled,"This painting, datable to about 2001, might be read as a grove of trees along a lakeshore."
Colophons_to_Two_Paintings,"These colophons were written on two sheets of decorated paper—one oriented vertically, the other horizontally—which Xie subsequently mounted together. The letter paper is printed with a pale blue image of blossoming plums, along with Xie's studio name, Zhuangmu Tang, or ""Hall of a Spirited Old Man."" On the first sheet, Xie composed a colophon for his own painting of the scenery near Mount Yan, in northern China, where he traveled in September 1987. (The painting was executed in March of the following year.) The second sheet bears a colophon for an unidentified painting by the monk-painter Kuncan (1612–1673). Xie commented particularly on the calligraphy of Kuncan's inscription."
Landscapes,"Having lived as an itinerant monk nearly his entire life, Shitao decided in 1696 to shed his Buddhist garb, end his peripatetic life, and build himself a home in the prosperous commercial center of Yangzhou, where he supported himself through his painting. In this album, painted not long after Shitao settled in Yangzhou, the artist has drawn for inspiration on his own lifetime of wandering. We feel the painter's presence in each of the images as he explores the themes of traveling and dwelling among mountains and lakes."
"The_Greatly_Merciful,_Greatly_Compassionate_Rescuer_from_Suffering,_Bodhisattva_Guanyin","This humble image of Guanyin is a rare survival from the early days of printing in China. It was commissioned by Cao Yuanzhong, ruler of Dunhuang, the oasis town in western China that was the final stopping point for Silk Road travelers before the arid horrors of the Taklamakan desert. This print was one of many Buddhist artworks commissioned by Cao to aid travelers to and from Dunhuang. The text, which identifies Guanyin as “Greatly Merciful, Greatly Compassionate Rescuer from Suffering,” calls upon the deity to bring an end to war and disease and to watch over the highways in and out of the oasis."
Poem_on_a_hermitage,"Tu Long is best known as a poet and a dramatist. Forced out of government office in 1583 as a result of slander, Tu returned to his home in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, to lead the life of a poor scholar, dabbling in Daoism and eking out a meager livelihood composing epitaphs and other commemorative pieces.Tu Long's calligraphy epitomizes the late Ming taste for bold large-character cursive. His sharply tilted characters of varying sizes, in which the curved and hooked strokes are emphasized, also reflect the influence of the middle Ming master Zhu Yunming (1461–1527). This poem, which was published about 1582 in Tu's first collection of poetry, is one of twelve he composed at a gathering of friends in the autumn rain."
Couplet_in_the_Style_of_the_Haotaiwang_Stele,"At the request of Li Ming (Richard Lai), Feng Kanghou used the characters from the Haotaiwang Stele, a monument commemorating an ancient Korean king dated 414, to compose and transcribe this poetic couplet:The mountain villages in my homeland spread near and far;Year after year fragrant hemp is harvested in abundance.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)Feng followed his model closely. The clerical script characters, in distinct rectangular shapes, are evenly spaced out. The strictly parallel strokes and perpendicular intersections create a sense of stability appropriate for writings expected to last forever. As befits a work from a transitional period, the stele's calligraphy also incorporates attributes of seal script and standard script. Most noticeably, the emphatic flaring at the end of horizontal or diagonal strokes, which is typical of clerical script writings, is missing. Instead, the width of individual strokes is rather even throughout, the corners are often rounded, and straight lines sometimes turn into smooth curves—all stylistic characteristics of seal script—while the occasional modulation of individual strokes is a defining feature of standard script."
Poetic_Couplet_for_Xiangru,"In this pair of hanging scrolls, Lin Yutang transcribed a famous couplet from a poem by Yan Shu (991–1055), a high-ranking official and major poet of the Northern Song period (960–1127). It reads:No matter what, flowers die.As if they once knew me, swallows return.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)Written in Lin's typical informal manner, the calligraphy achieves an overall effect of easy grace with little regard to the articulation of individual strokes.Lin Yutang dedicated this work to his third daughter, Xiangru (Hsiang Ju). The third character in the second line of the poem, xiang, corresponds to the first character of his daughter's given name; Lin cleverly personalized his gift by replacing the matching third character of the first line in the original poem, nai, with the second character of her name, ru, thus embedding her name within the fabric of the couplet. Lin's ingenious tampering with a well-known text shows the playfulness in his personality and his affectionate thoughtfulness for family members."
Bamboo_and_Cicada,"Zhao Shao'ang, a native of Guangzhou, was the most influential artist in the second generation of the so-called Lingnan School of Guangdong painters, who are known for Western-inspired realism in their work. Extensively exhibiting his art abroad, Zhao may have had a greater impact on the West than in China.In this daring composition, the bamboo is executed in a single, powerful brushstroke punctuated by pauses and subtle realignments that exemplify Zhao's signature ""one stroke"" method. His depiction of the cicada goes beyond traditional painting by capturing the varied textures of the insect's body and wings. Most importantly, while the cicada's profile is sharply defined, the details on the surface of its body are deliberately blurred. The result is an organic realism that best approximates the imperfect perception of objects by the human eye.The cicada was a favorite subject of Zhao Shao'ang. In his inscription, it is clear that he cherished its conventional associations with the Confucian virtues of loftiness and purity, inspired by the cicada's habit of perching high on trees and the false belief that it lived entirely on dew:As jade-green leaves wither in autumn,Cicadas begin their melancholy songs in the chill.Unwilling to chase worldly glory,They drink dew to preserve their purity.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)"
Chirping_Bird,"Zhao Shao'ang has been praised by some critics as the best flower-and-bird painter of his time. This painting, which blends descriptive realism and impressionistic brushwork, exemplifies Zhao's firm grasp of both avian anatomy and the nature of human perception. The bird's joints and claws stand out distinctly, while the dashing brushstrokes and blurred colors of its plumage vividly recreate the sight of its fluttering motion. The bird's gaping mouth and well-defined tongue evoke an equally strong sensation of its shrill chirping. Zhao's representations of birds excel not only in their ""jewel-like sensuous glitter,"" as noted by the critic Pierre Rouve, but also in their animated postures. Here, he has captured the bird in a fleeting moment just after landing, when it stands low on its legs, wings aflutter, tail raised high. Dedicating the painting to Lin Yutang's daughter, Taiyi, Zhao added a poetic couplet:Fluttering about are many lovely birds.Singing melodiously, they enjoy this beautiful moment.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)"
Couplet_Composed_from_Jiang_Kui's_Verses,"This work is a collaboration of two friends. Yang Tianji, an accomplished calligrapher and seal-carver from Jiangsu province, transcribes a couplet that another versatile artist Chen Hengke (1876–1923) composed by assembling phrases from several ci poems of the Southern Song (1127–1279) poet Jiang Kui (1155?–?1221).The couplet reads:Banana leaves, window gauze,It is true that a night's intimacy leads toten years of melancholy dreams.Rainbow bridge, paths by water,Don't forget the time when, in the misty rain on the lake,the pair of oars rippled the duckweeds.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)This practice of combining poetic phrases or lines from different sources into a new composition was popular among early-twentieth-century traditional poets and artists. Yang Tianji began studying calligraphy in childhood. By his prime he had familiarized himself with the styles of all the major masters and ancient script types. This piece exemplifies his standard script, for which he is best known. The angular corners and barely modulated lines of certain characters also reflect his command of clerical and seal scripts."
Pensive_bodhisattvas,"The tracing at left derives from an eighth-century figure on the north wall of Cave 320, Dunhuang."
Qu_Yuan_and_the_Fisherman,"This fan depicts an encounter between the exiled minister Qu Yuan—purported author of the Nine Songs—and a wise fisherman. Dejected at his banishment from the capital, Qu complains to the fisherman of a world gone mad. The fisherman replies that Qu should take the world as it comes and adapt to changing circumstances. This dialogue was made famous in the literary collection Chu ci."
Cloudy_Mountains,"The son of Mi Fu (1052–1107), Mi Youren was an accomplished scholar-artist and the leading connoisseur of his time, often acting as the authenticator of ancient paintings for the emperor. He rose to the position of vice president of the Board of War. The simplified, blurry mountain forms, which Mi Youren inherited from his father (there is no longer any reliable example of the older Mi's painted work), represent a significant break from the detailed Northern Sung landscape styles. Created with wet ink dots (called ""Mi-family dots""), this style of landscape painting is the immediated predecessor of the evocative ink-wash landscape style of the later Southern Song period. Referred to by scholar-artists as ""ink play,"" the style suggests the importance of the painter's psychological expression, thereby raising the status of painting to that of poetry and calligraphy."
Wrist_rest_decorated_with_long_beans,"This wrist rest is an excellent example of bamboo carving by Jin Xiya (1890–1979), the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. It showcases Jin’s virtuosic command of traditional bamboo carving as well as his creative experimentation. His works incorporate compositions from designs contributed by important modern artists, such as Jin Cheng (1878–1926) on this piece. Jin’s works not only represent the highest achievement of bamboo carving in early twentieth century China, but they also preserve a microcosm of the literati world of that time, when members of the scholarly elite sought to sustain inherited traditions in the face of a rapidly modernizing world.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (wrist rest #42), the bamboo carving was completed on November 23, 1935."
Riverscape_with_moored_boats,"The obscure painter Wu Shantao lived in the waning years of the Ming dynasty and through the transition to Qing rule. During this period, images of reclusion became particularly poignant, as people experienced the wrenching pain of dynastic collapse and reconstruction. Moored by the water’s edge, unseen except by passing birds, these fishing boats represented release from worldly troubles."
Spring_Offerings,"Wu Changshuo adopted the ""antiquarian epigrapher's taste"" pioneered by Zhao Zhiqian (1829–1884): a deliberately naive, slightly awkward manner derived from the engravings on archaic stone monuments. Wu's favorite subjects were bold colorful images of flowers and rocks that found a ready market among Shanghai's new urban class. Spring Offerings presents popular emblems of long life and renewal appropriate for a New Year's greeting: lingzhi mushroom, narcissus, a garden rock, and the bright red berries of the nandina plant. It is not an image from nature, however, but an abstract arrangement that emphasizes epigraphic elements—round centered-tip brushwork, contrasts of form and blank space—in a simplified composition dominated by strong diagonal cross-movements.Wu's boldly brushed poem reads:The narcissus is long-lived and the lingzhi mushroom never fades,At year's end their appearance consoles my loneliness.The gnarled rock, set down by Heaven,Is like the Kunlunnu tribesman who waits upon the [singing girl clad in] red silk."
Landscape_in_the_Style_of_Juran_and_Yan_Wengui,"At the age of eighty, Wang Hui continued to find inspiration for his paintings in the styles of the ancients. On an album leaf in the National Palace Museum, Taipei, dated 1713, he wrote that his sixty years of studying and emulating old masters had passed like a single day. In autumn of the same year, he painted this handscroll, which combines the disparate styles of Juran (act. ca. 960–95), evoked with long, soft brush lines that give texture and contour to the hillsides, and of Yan Wengui (act. ca. 970–1030), suggested by finely textured surfaces executed in crisp short strokes and dots. The inscription describes Wang Hui's inspiration:Some years ago I was a guest in the capital, where, at the home of a collector, I was able to see a great many scrolls by ancient men. Among them were two paintings: Juran's River Pass on a Clear Morning and Yan Wengui's Fishing near a Mountain Pass. Their divine color was magnificent and each was extremely refined and marvelous, among the best of all the famous works of the Song and Yuan. Suddenly, after more than twenty years, they have come to my breast. This scroll was made by combining the two masters' general concepts. Although in purity, truth, and subtle blandness it is not close to them, in its style it is not very far."
Landscapes,"Dai Xi was an accomplished poet, calligrapher, and painter as well as serving as Vice Minister of Military Affairs. In 1832 he was made a member of the Hanlin Academy, the prestigious body of scholars patronized by the imperial court.This elegant album was made for the poet Zhang Xianghe, who inscribed a long poem following Dai's paintings and colophon. The compositions and brushwork of Dai's paintings recall the playful and spontaneous style of the early Qing master Shitao (1642–1707)."
Gottwaldov,"In the 1950s, images of fuming smokestacks, high-rise buildings, and broad highways were signs of progress. Fu’s depiction of Gottwaldov (present-day Zlìn, Czech Republic), celebrates these promises of socialist prosperity. Fu’s inscription reads, in part, “When entering the city, we saw tall buildings bathed in dim twilight and thick smoke. Te Wei remarked, ‘This must be a chemical industry city.’ I immediately made a sketch, and the driver nodded in agreement with my conception.”"
Song_of_Sixteen_Characters:_Poem_by_Mao_Zedong,"The speed and motion of soldiers and horses, as well as the flames and smoke swirling into the sky, convey a powerful sense of the urgency of battle. Fu’s image is only loosely based on Mao’s poem:Mountain.The sea collapses and the river boils.Innumerable horses raceInsanely into the peak of battle."
Poet_Li_Bai,"Seated in a garden with blossoming plums, the poet Li Bai (701–762) gets drunk to set his soul free, and yet his gaze expresses deep emotion, as if seeing all life’s affairs unfolding. Painted two days before the artist’s sixtieth birthday, this is, according to the artist’s inscription, the most satisfactory of all of Fu’s portrayals of Li Bai. In a modest tone, Fu wonders if it has captured a tiny bit of the poet’s spirit."
Huichang:_Poem_by_Mao_Zedong,"Mao Zedong’s poem alludes to the Red Army’s advance on Huichang, Jiangxi Province, where it established a southern revolutionary base in 1929. A Jiangxi native, Fu expressed his intimate association with the place as a backdrop for revolution. Luxuriant woods and all-embracing mountains provide a bucolic setting for the antlike line of soldiers."
Travelers_in_Snowy_Mountains,"Drawing on memory and imagination, Fu Baoshi painted this hauntingly beautiful snow scene in mid-autumn. Fu’s elongated composition, which emphasizes the height of the trees, and his flattening of the trees’ bare branches into abstract lacework has transformed this vision of snow-spattered hills and an icy river into a mysterious realm of arbitrary patterns. The travelers’ blue and red attire punctuates this poetically somber landscape with cheerful accents and human warmth."
Sun_Yat-sen's_Mausoleum,"The mausoleum of the founder of the Republic of China was a famous landmark in Nanjing, the city where Fu Baoshi lived during the final two decades of his life. During this period, his work increasingly reflected his lifelong observations of war and revolution. Here, the dense forest surrounding the shrine creates a solemn, gloomy mood that suggests the artist’s emotional state just months before his death on September 29, 1965."
"Green_Mountains_Like_the_Sea,_the_Dying_Sun_Like_Blood","This painting was inspired by the last line of Mao Zedong’s poem “Loushan Pass,” written during the Long March (1934–36). By 1964 the Long March was viewed as an old propaganda theme. Yet the political movements and mass mobilization of the 1960s gave fresh impetus to calls for reviving the earlier revolutionary spirit."
Changsha:_Poetic_Thoughts_of_Mao_Zedong,"Fu illustrated Mao Zedong’s 1925 poem “Changsha” in which Mao portrayed himself as a thoughtful scholar with noble aspirations, moral responsibilities, and deep feelings for the country. Fu followed the “red line” in such late political paintings, responding to the alarming attacks against other artists whose works were labeled as too “black,” “elitist,” and “highly toxic,” which foretold another policy change in the art world on the eve of the Cultural Revolution (1966–76)."
The_Seven_Worthies_of_the_Bamboo_Grove,"The subject of this painting is a group of third-century scholars who found solace in nature while enjoying wine, music, poetry, and Daoist-oriented “pure conversation” to distance themselves from the corrupt political world. To commemorate similar gatherings in wartime Chongqing, Fu and his friends created a caricature of these men titled The Seven Worthies Coming out of the Grove."
Dwelling_amid_Waters_and_Forests,"One of the few extant works demonstrating Fu’s early style before he traveled to Japan, this painting bears the artist’s inscription: “At the height of the summer, the Great Heat, in the renshen year [1932], I was traveling in Jinling [Nanjing]. With leisure time in the long summer, I painted this as a pastime.” When Fu left Japan, he entrusted his teacher Kinbara Seigo (1888–1963) with this landscape and other early works."
Thatched_Hut_of_Great_Purity,"In his late years, the artist Shitao (1642–1707) wrote a letter to his relative and fellow artist Bada Shanren (1624–1705) requesting a painting of his residence, the “Thatched Hut of Great Purity.” The letter specifies the painting’s size and contents, including “several old trees” and “an old man in a pavilion, but not a monk, as [Shitao] wears his hair and cap.” Fu took the letter’s request as the inspiration for this painting."
Viewing_a_Waterfall_from_a_Mountain_Ridge,"The series of waterfalls that cascade through a mountain valley in this painting exemplify Fu Baoshi’s equal mastery of describing both rocky masses and flowing water. Only a few dry lines indicate the rush of the stream, while rich layers of ink wash and scumbled brushstrokes define the rocky cliffs and foliage of the defile."
Approaching_Yanbian,"This painting captures an unforgettable scene from Fu’s journey. On the way to the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, looking out from the train window, Fu saw that the sky and surface of the water appeared bright red, almost the color of blood. Dawn had come, and he would soon be in Yanbian. He immediately made a sketch. Fu was dissatisfied with this work because of its rich red tint, but this experiment prepared him for the “red line” advocated by the Communist party in the years to come."
After_Wang_Meng’s_“The_Sounds_of_a_Waterfall_amid_Autumn_Valleys”,"This dense, monumental landscape shows Fu experimenting with the composition and brush style of the Yuan dynasty artist Wang Meng (1301–1385). The orthodox tradition was criticized as backward, conservative, and stagnant during the twentieth century, but Fu’s conscientious study of ancient masters’ brushwork enabled him to acquire the technical skills necessary to permit his later improvisatory style."
Myriad_Bamboo_in_Mist_and_Rain,"This painting was inspired by a sudden rainstorm that Fu experienced while strolling on a mountain path. Struck by the scene’s beauty, he later created this painting. In writing about the event he observed, “This is creativity by chance, based on the spontaneity of the artist’s intuitive response. Yet, one accidental achievement is based on uncountable travels from which the artist gains nourishment.”"
Playing_the_Ruan,"Here, three women listen intently to the strains of a lute-like ruan. Their pensive expressions, leaning poses, and tight-knit triangular grouping reflect the art and theories of the Eastern Jin master Gu Kaizhi (ca. 345–406), who advocated “capturing the spirit through the form.” Fu’s fluid, curving brushlines also capture something of Gu’s musical “iron wire” draftsmanship."
The_Elixir_Terrace:_Landscape_after_Shitao,"The soaring peaks and overhanging cliff of this painting convey the scenic drama of Mount Huang (Yellow Mountain) in Anhui Province, where the legendary Yellow Emperor was said to have refined the elixir of immortality. In its conception, Fu’s composition is indebted to the imaginative renderings of the mountain by Shitao (1642–1707), but Fu’s hallmark texture strokes—swiftly brushed marks of different ink densities—create forms that appear both substantial and transparent."
After_Mao_Zedong’s_Poem_“Swimming”,"On May 31, 1956, Mao Zedong swam across the Yangzi River from Wuchang to Hankou. He ventured across the river many other times, finding in it the inspiration for “a great plan.” As laid out in his poem “Swimming” of June 1956, he wanted to tame the Yangzi with human structures. Fu must have seen a newspaper photograph of Mao swimming in the river and borrowed the composition for this painting."
Mount_Jinggang,"This impressive landscape depicts the revolutionary base at Jinggang Mountain in the Luoxiao Mountains, located between Jiangxi and Hunan provinces. Without Fu’s inscription, it is difficult to relate the serene landscape to the political theme of revolution. The inscription reveals that the artist traveled there in November 1963 and, upon his return, painted this work and inscribed Mao Zedong’s poem about the revolutionary site."
A_Majestic_View_of_the_Mountainous_City:_Chongqing,"To Fu, some of the happiest times in his life occurred during his wartime sojourn in Chongqing. Twenty years later, experiencing Chongqing with a new purpose, Fu focused on a densely populated city undergoing rapid social and economic change. Smoke billows from ships on the Yangzi River and from factories in different parts of the city. “Appearing like heaven and earth turned upside down, the changes to our homeland have been tremendous,” Fu commented."
Mirror_Lake_and_Flying_Waterfall,"Fu Baoshi visited the Mirror Lake waterfall in Heilongjiang Province shortly after a rainstorm greatly increased its flow. As Fu recalled, “I heard what appeared to be the rumble of thunder [moving at] the speed of lighting. The loud roar [of the waterfall] shook the valley.” When the water level rose to belly height on the path, a comrade carried Fu across on his back. He continued, “This emotion and this scene—how can I forget? Can’t I convey them in painting?”"
Waterfall_at_Heavenly_Lake,"This strikingly simple, abstract composition captures the awe-inspiring grandeur of Changbai Falls, which flows from Heavenly Lake atop Changbai Mountain in Jilin. Only the tiny figures at the base of the falls provide a sense of scale. Neither the source nor the outlet of the water is defined. Instead, Fu Baoshi confronts us with this monumental frontal image of water cascading between the dark flanks of a sheer cliff. With great economy, he employs graded washes and a few bold brushstrokes to render the scene."
Meticulously_Painting_Our_Rivers_and_Mountains,"Depicted here is Mount Hua, China’s great Sacred Mountain of the West. Paradoxically, the idea of taking a study tour to understand contemporary life had made Fu more aware of China’s pictorial tradition. Fu related his encounter with this mountain to the art of Wang Lu (1332–after 1383), who created a famous album depicting views of Mount Hua. The challenge to the modern artist, Fu remarked, was how to simultaneously realize tradition and express the present day."
Guchengli,"Both the painting’s diagonal composition and the streaks of blue wash used to depict the water help convey the swift flow of the river, where huge log rafts are each being guided by a single helmsman. The artist’s inscription describes this scene:As our group came down from [Changbai] Mountain, we spent a night at Guchengli [in Helong municipality]. . . .Where the two rugged shores confront each other, the water flows rapidly. Farther down, it falls into the Tumen River [along the border between China and North Korea]."
Water_Pavilion_in_an_Autumn_Forest,"Fu’s inscription reads:Qing [1644–1911] landscapes painted before the Qianlong [1736–1796] and Jiaqing [1796–1820] periods tended to focus on deep mountains and remote valleys. But Gong Xian [1619–1689], Gao Fenghan [1683–1749], and Lü Qian [1621–1706] followed a more vigorous style and brought forth stylistic transformation. Baoshi.—Trans. Anita Chung"
Level_Sands_and_Descending_Geese,Level Sands and Descending Geese was one of the “Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers” that were first painted in the Northern Song era (960–1127) following poems of the same theme composed by Song Di (act. late 11th century). Fu Baoshi painted this image several times in his last years. The contemplative mood and sense of isolation evoked by the painting may suggest something of the artist’s own mental state at this time.
Recluse_Fishing_by_Autumn_Trees,"Sheng Mao's career as a successful professional painter frequently contrasted with that of his reclusive neighbor Wu Zhen (1280–1354). This painting is important because it shows that Sheng was aware of Wu's style and adopted it for his own use. Recalling Wu Zhen's depictions of hermit-fishermen, Sheng Mao shows his angler dressed in the elegant robes of a scholar. Two early Ming artists, Wang Fu and Lin Yong, have expanded upon the theme of the hermit-fisherman in appreciative poems added at the top of the painting."
The_Summit_of_the_Tatry_Mountains,"Fu Baoshi painted this image after a visit to the Tatry Mountains, which form the border between Slovakia and Poland. Fu rendered the mountains with his usual repertoire of texture strokes and ink washes but pointedly added the sweeping lines of a cable car as a way of highlighting the industrial development of another socialist nation."
Scuttling_Crab,"Qi Baishi emerged as an artist of distinctive genius late in life when he was able to integrate the study of calligraphy into his brushwork. This painting shows his tendency, even into his fifties, to rely on loose visual suggestion rather than on a calligraphic system of expressive brush lines. Each stroke that defines the crab's body and legs is painstakingly individualized to perform a specific descriptive function. Compare this representational mode of depiction with that of the adjacent Shrimp, done only eight years later, after Qi's images were enriched by his new calligraphic manner."
Dreaming_of_Flowers,"This painting tells the story of how the scholar Wang Guozhen came to have the nickname “Dreaming of Flowers” (Menghua, 夢花). One day, Wang dozed off while at work in his garden. In a dream state, he walked into the garden, where he encountered an old man who lectured him on the illusory nature of sight, saying: “This riot of lushness around you . . . they are flowers, yet they are not, as flowers are only ever the illusion of flowers.” Light color and faint ink make the scene dreamlike, but they also reflect a renewed interest among nineteenth-century artists in Suzhou painters of the sixteenth century. This lightness of touch offered an antidote to the bold and heavy styles that had dominated the eighteenth century."
Landscape,"By the end of the 1930s, after Huang Binhong had experimented with landscape, he returned to the study of earlier idioms but with a freer approach to brushwork that approached abstraction.This album leaf recalls the works of such Ming loyalists as Bada Shanren (1626–1705) and Kuncan (1612–1673). Red has been used to highlight the bridges, houses, and trees, but the effect emphasizes the linear patterns of these elements rather than their forms. Instead of signing this work, Huang impressed it with a seal that he placed in the sky above the landscape, as if it were the sun."
Fish_and_rocks,"To disguise his identity, Zhu Da, a scion of the Ming imperial family, took refuge in a Buddhist temple after the Manchu conquest of 1644. About 1680 he renounced his status as a monk and began producing paintings and calligraphy in order to support himself. In 1684 he took the biehao (artistic name) Bada Shanren (Mountain Man of the Eight Greats). A staunch Ming loyalist throughout his life, Bada used painting as a means of protest. His is the poignant voice of the yimin, the leftover subjects of the fallen dynasty.This painting is typical of the bold enigmatic images that Zhu Da produced during the last twenty years of his life. The seemingly innocuous subject, a garden pond framed by two ornamental rocks, becomes, in Zhu Da's rendition, profoundly unsettling. Were it not for seven tiny fish that swim beneath the two rock forms, transforming the blank paper into a body of water, the image would be unrecognizable. Six of the fish are shown in profile, but the seventh appears as if seen from above, leaving the viewer disoriented; the absence of a horizon line adds to the unsettling effect. Treating the image as a calligraphic design, Bada juxtaposes large and small, solid and void, and heavy and light, creating a tension between flat shapes and three-dimensional volumes that heightens the disturbing quality."
Letter,"Wang Ao was a gifted scholar from Suzhou who rose to become a Grand Secretary, one of the most prominent posts in the imperial bureaucracy. The text of this letter is decorous but light on content; mostly it is taken up with expressions of gratitude for previous letters and apologies for missing a chance to meet in person. Although the letter is perfunctory, the luxurious hydrangea-print stationery and the sinuous brushwork from a famous hand made this an object worth treasuring."
Thirty-six_Peaks_of_Mount_Huang_Recollected,"Among the wide range of styles developed by Shitao is this splattered ink technique, which the artist once described as “ten thousand ugly ink dots.” In this monumental work, Shitao re-created the scenery of Yellow Mountain from memory with bold brushstrokes “written” in the robust calligraphic style of Yan Zhenqing (709–785).For Shitao, the ultimate mountain scenery was represented by the incomparable peaks of Mount Huang, the Yellow Mountain in Anhui Province. Here, the artist recalls himself as the tireless traveler searching for exciting scenery; the seal following his signature reads: “I search out all the strange peaks to make designs [for my paintings].”"
Spring_Mountain_after_Rain,"By the late 1920's, Qi, well into his sixties had acquired a reputation in Peking, well-connected friends and financial ease from the sales of his paintings. As he reports in his diary: ""When I am cold I have coals to burn"". Qi Baishi took a post as a professor of art at Peking University. In 1928, he also published a volume of his poetry and four volumes of seal carvings.Spring Mountain after Rain belongs to this period of Qi's increasing confidence in his work. His bold adaptation of the ink-dot style associated with Mi Fu (1051–1107) attests to his creative assurance. He transforms the brush dabs into strong inky imprints and adds a daringly bright color to the traditional ink monochrome style."
The_Qutang_Gorge,"The Qutang Gorge, located along the upper reaches of the Yangzi River in western China, has long been celebrated in literature and art for its grandeur and danger. Living in nearby Chongqing during the Sino-Japanese War, Fu Baoshi repeatedly painted its spectacular scenery. His diagonal composition intensifies the sense of the river’s momentum while his juxtaposition of wispy sails against the implacable cliffs suggests the ephemerality of human existence.In this painting, Fu transcribed a poem by the Sichuan poet Lü Qian (1621–1706) on the theme of homesickness. It resonates with his own sorrow over his forced dislocation from Nanjing, situated on the lower Yangzi River to the east:A few sails float on the river beyond the pavilion.Standing so long against the west wind, my temples turn gray.Only my homesick heart does not flow eastward downstream,Since it long ago followed the misty moon up the Qutang Gorge."
Travelers_among_Streams_and_Mountains,"Wu Li, one of the six great Orthodox School masters of the early Qing, began his study of ancient paintings with an album owned by the venerable Orthodox painter Wang Shimin (1592–1680). The album, entitled Within Small See Large (Xiaozhong xianda), contained reduced copies of Song and Yuan masterpieces owned by Wang.In Travelers among Streams and Mountains, probably made in the 1670s, Wu Li carefully copies the album leaf that preserves a composition by the late Yuan master Wang Meng (ca. 1308–1385). Wu’s interpretation gives the work new life, however, through the vigor and spontaneity of his execution. Responding and adjusting to each newly realized brushstroke in a constant interaction between brush, ink, paper, and the observed form, Wu Li’s brushwork and composition grow with the “momentum” and “force” (shi) of the artist’s performance.In addition to superb brushwork, Wu Li demonstrates a genius for using ink; using different shades of gray, he creates in his landscape the luminous atmospheric quality that is one of his hallmarks."
Ink_bamboo,"A branch of bamboo stretches across this handscroll, its dangling leaves framing a poem inscribed by the artist. The verse reveals that the scene was observed by moonlight after the artist had awoken from a tipsy nap:The moon sinks low in the fourth watch, paper windows seem empty,Stirring from a drunken sleep, I prop my head and read awhile,Lofty thoughts—I force myself, but can’t help it;Ten stalks, still green in winter, cast profuse shadows.—Translation after Marc F. Wilson and Kwan S. Wong"
Birds_in_a_lotus_pond,"Focusing on a narrow band of the natural world, Birds in a Lotus Pond, datable stylistically to about 1690, shows the artist boldly experimenting with the highly absorbent medium of satin to create a daring composition of saturated ink lines and dots starkly set against a blank background. The scroll opens with the daringly abstract form of a torn lotus leaf that is precariously suspended from its bent stalk, which extends leftward above a cluster of half-hidden blossoms. The black leaf stands in contrast to a stark white boulder, defined only by its ink outline. Two fluffy chicks perch atop this boulder, apparently oblivious to their surroundings. On the shore beyond crouch two mynahs, their glances directed upward toward a final lotus leaf that looms above them. Balanced on the back of the second mynah is another tiny chick, its beak open in song or hunger.The birds appear to personify the interaction of dark and light that animates the entire composition; the human-like expressions with which Bada has imbued them adds an unsettling quality to the already enigmatic composition."
Pavilion_amongst_Wintry_Trees_after_Ni_Zan,"Qi Zhijia, whom a contemporary described as being ""addicted to calligraphy, painting, kickball, cymbal music, and opera,"" was a native of Shanyin, Zhejiang Province. He served briefly as an official under the Ming dynasty, but retired after the Manchu conquest of 1644, adopting the lifestyle of a scholar-recluse. Renown as a poet and calligrapher, he also excelled in landscape painting in the styles of the tenthcentury masters Dong Yuan and Juran.In this painting Qi has adopted the spare landscape idiom of the scholar-artist Ni Zan (1306–1374). Typified by an isolated grove of trees or empty pavilion set within an austere river landscape, Ni's images have long been understood as emblematic of the displacement and isolation experienced by many members of the educated elite during the disintegration of the Mongol Yuan dynasty. After the fall of the Ming, many loyalists consciously evoked Ni's pictorial imagery as a way of expressing their response to dynastic collapse."
The_Immortal_Li_Tieguai,"Qi Baishi delighted in painting the Daoist immortal Li Tieguai, whose unkempt appearance made a ready match for Qi’s quick brushwork and casual control of saturation. This depiction of Li shows him squatting by a brazier, an unusual posture that Qi seems amused by in his inscription:I wrote a poem about Li Tieguai [Iron-crutch Li]. It goes:If I throw away my gourd and crutch,Who will recognize me as an immortal?In this painting I added a cinnabar stove. Li looks more like a hungry ghost.Painted and inscribed by Baishi.--Translation after Keita Itoh and Lawrence Wu"
Outing_to_Zhang_Gong's_Grotto,"Zhang Gong's grotto, a famous scenic spot and once the abode of Zhang Daoling (Zhang Gong; 2nd century A.D.), a patriarch of the Daoist church, is located near Lake Tai in Jiangsu Province, not far from the pottery center of Yixing. According to Daoist beliefs, such grottoes are wellsprings of nature's creative force and offer the potential for rejuvenation and renewal.Shitao's painting of the grotto, done at the peak of his artistic powers, about 1700, is one of his most sumptuous masterpieces. Following an earlier composition by Shen Zhou (1427–1509), Shitao painted as if he were reenacting the cosmic process of creation: by building up layers of energized brushwork in flowery hues of sky blue, pale green, orange, and fuchsia, he transformed Shen Zhou's topographical likeness into a glowing image redolent of nature's procreative power. In a long poem at the end of the scroll, Shitao acknowledges the mystical Daoist attributes of the cave and playfully suggests that through his art he has captured both the cave and its creative force."
Mist_and_Rain_in_Helin,"The soft, wet washes in this landscape signal the brushwork lineage of Mi Fu, a famous calligrapher, painter, and connoisseur of the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127). Seven hundred years after his death, Mi was celebrated in the city of Zhenjiang by painters like Pan Simu, who wanted to build a regional school of painting based there. This painting’s stated site, Helin, was the temple near which Mi was buried. Pan jokes in his inscription, “If Mi Fu were to return he’d laugh at this and wonder, ‘Who is trying to pilfer the meditations of my practice?’”"
Recluse_Gazing_at_a_Waterfall,"Zhang Daqian’s male figures often suggest a hint of self-portraiture. Here, a white-robed scholar who vaguely resembles a young Zhang Daqian sits atop a rocky promontory gazing wistfully at a waterfall. The artist’s inscription reads:The stream chills half the tree,All year long is autumnal.Chanting, he sits with hunched shoulders like a lonely crane.A golden pavilion appears in the myriad cloudsPoem by Zhang Laopu, Zhang Daqian Yuan, tenth month of the jichou year [1949].--Translation after Keita Itoh and Lawrence Wu"
Tao_Yuanming,"In wartime China during the 1940s, Fu Baoshi often turned to ancient subjects to express his grief, anger, and bewilderment at the troubled world around him. He continued to paint such themes, especially depictions of poets and famous poems, after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, though the new context gave them additional layers of meaning. Here, he depicts a reflective Tao Yuanming, whose decision to renounce official life and return to his farm made him the quintessential emblem of escape."
Poet_strolling_by_a_marshy_bank,"Liang Kai served as a painter-in-attendance at the Song Imperial Painting Academy in Hangzhou from about 1201 to 1204; he relinquished that prestigious position to live and paint at a Chan (Zen in Japanese) Buddhist temple. Like his best-known paintings, preserved mostly in Japanese collections, this small landscape conveys a spiritual intensity. Under the great cliff, in the stillness of the landscape, a solitary figure meditates on the illusory world before him."
Bathing_the_Horse,"Pu Jin, a member of the Qing royal family, states in his inscription that this work is copied from a genuine painting by Han Gan (act. 742–56), a Tang court painter who specialized in images of horses."
Drunken_recluse_beneath_an_old_tree,"By the end of the fifteenth century the court had ceased to be the principal patron of the arts, so professional painters turned to private sponsors and to the marketplace as outlets for their work, adopting a bravura style of execution that transformed painting into a kind of performance art. Using an idiom of bold monochrome brushwork and graded ink washes first employed by Chan (Zen) Buddhist monk-artists during the thirteenth century, these artists made compositions with dazzling virtuosity, often before astonished onlookers.The Fukinese painter Chen Zihe was a significant regional master in this tradition who took the sobriquet ""Uninhibited Immortal"" to emphasize his rejection of convention. Chen's humorous and somewhat provocative image of a drunken immortal exhibits all the key conventions of his craft. The shallow picture space and tight composition are constructed of powerful diagonals that intensify the dramatic focus, while highly animated brushwork offers a lively counterpoint to the massive scale of the pictorial elements, many of which are truncated by the frame."
To_Guo_Moruo:_Poetic_Thoughts_of_Mao_Zedong,"In Mao Zedong’s poem “Reply to Comrade Guo Moruo,” the Monkey King, a character in the classical novel Journey to the West, is invoked in the battle against the skeleton spirits. The poem’s imagery alludes to the conflict between China and the Soviet Union that began in 1960. In Fu’s interpretation, dark swirling “demon clouds” obscure all but Beijing’s Tian’anmen Gate before the Monkey King arrives to clear the dust and force the skeleton spirits to retreat."
Autumn_Colors_among_Streams_and_Mountains,"In this long handscroll, Shen Zhou explored four Yuan painters' brush idioms-those of Ni Zan (1306–1374), Huang Gongwang (1269–1354), Wang Meng (ca. 1308–1385), and Wu Zhen (1280–1354). Beginning with the familiar Ni Zan image of sparse trees, barren rocks, and an empty pavilion, Shen Zhou developed Ni's angular ""folded-belt"" texture strokes into a longer texture pattern that signaled the style of Huang Gongwang and an expansive change of mood. Then, with his brush tip turned inward to form round, dense, curling, and stippled texture strokes, Shen created rock forms that contained the controlled energy of those by Wang Meng. Finally, using simple round brushstrokes to represent rolling shores and blunt and stocky trees, he evoked the serene and melancholy mood of Wu Zhen.By practicing the different brush idioms of the Yuan masters, Shen was able to treat the theme of autumn mountains with a wide range of expressive moods and interpretations."
Mountain_Spirit,"The heroine of “Mountain Spirit,” an ancient ode from the shamanistic Nine Songs, a literary cycle attributed to Qu Yuan (343–278 B.C.), was a major inspiration for Fu Baoshi’s figure painting. The subject, plausibly identified as a goddess associated with poetic eroticism, manifests herself as “theclouds of morning and the rain of evening”; hence Fu always portrayed her moving through a turbulent mist-filled sky. Although the text describes her wearing “a coat of fig leaves with a rabbit-floss girdle,” Fu depicts her in a white flowing robe with long fluttering sashes in the manner of Gu Kaizhi (ca. 345–406). Her rouged cheeks and lips and longing gaze intensify the sensuality of her curved silhouette."
A_Glance_from_the_Window,"According to Fu Baoshi’s inscription, this painting of a public square was done “in a room on the fifth floor of the Moscow Hotel in Gottwaldov [present-day Zlìn, Czech Republic].” Noting that “the scene beyond the window is both tranquil and beautiful,” Fu’s image reflects the vast, Soviet-style squares that were just then being created across China. Notable similarities include the imposing statue in the foreground, the juxtaposition of new and old buildings, and the prominence of public transportation on the otherwise uncrowded streets."
Portrait_of_the_Poet_Du_Fu,"This painting depicts the Tang poet Du Fu (712–770), the “Sage of Poetry,” in a forest of tall pines. The image is based on Du Fu’s poetic lines cited by the military commander and foreign minister Chen Yi (1901–1972) during his visit to the Du Fu Thatched Cottage (now a memorial museum) in Chengdu. The work was painted for the Thatched Cottage to commemorate Chen Yi’s visit. The lines read:The new pines wish to grow a thousand feet.The evil bamboo should be cut—all ten thousand stalks."
After_Mao_Zedong’s_“Saying_Goodbye_to_the_God_of_Disease_(II)”,"Mao’s second poem on the eradication of disease envisions a bright future:We dig with silver shovelsAnd iron arms shake the earth and the Three Rivers.God of plagues, where are you going?We burn paper boats and candlesTo light his way to heaven.In Fu’s illustration, myriad springtime blossoms echo the legions of collective workers who go forth to increase production—with nature’s blessings—during the Great Leap Forward."
Writings_in_Praise_of_a_Houseboat,"明 李夢陽等十三家行書屋舟篇 卷 紙本This long handscroll is at once a great collaborative work and a vivid document of a social network. Around 1500, a doctor surnamed Qian commissioned thirteen prominent men—all of whom were talented calligraphers—to compose pieces on a single handscroll in praise of his houseboat. To these powerful men, a houseboat symbolized a carefree life unmoored from responsibilities. The handscroll is also a compendium of the diverse calligraphic styles in use at the turn of the sixteenth century, when many calligraphers broke from the dominant fashion to forge individual voices."
Spring_Colors_of_Zaoyuan,"Visiting locations important during the Communist revolution was an integral part of Fu’s study tour. It was considered a crucial “education of revolution.” On October 1 (National Day), the group was in Yan’an, Shaanxi Province, Mao Zedong’s wartime headquarters. Depicted here is Zaoyuan, or the Jujube Garden, near Mao’s residence. Although Fu visited Yan’an in the fall, he chose to illustrate the site in early spring, when the pink color of the blossoms—while the ground was still white with snow—symbolized China’s coming political rebirth."
Heaven_and_Earth_Glow_Red,"This painting illustrates a poem Mao Zedong composed for Guo Moruo that alludes to the Sino-Soviet conflict. Mao’s poem ends with the lines:The four oceans boil and clouds fume with rain.We wash away insectsAnd are strong.The five continents shake in the wind of lighting.—Trans. Anita ChungIn Fu’s interpretation, the brilliant red globe of the earth—one can make out China on the surface—floats above an ancient pine and an expansive ocean."
Spring_Radiance,"Fu covered almost the entire surface of this painting with dilute ink washes to evoke the moisture-laden atmosphere of a spring day when willow trees sprout new leaves and grasses grow dense. Through this lyrical setting strolls a lady accompanied by her maid carrying a pipa. The women’s attire, the musical instrument, and the beauty spots on both women’s faces all recall images of court ladies found in the painting of the Tang dynasty (618–907), while their self-conscious poses and synchronized, fluid movement recall dancers on stage."
Seven_Sages_of_the_Bamboo_Grove,"The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove were a group of third-century scholars who indulged in wine, music, poetry, and metaphysical discussions to keep a safe distance from the perilous political arena of the period. Fascinated with this subject, Fu Baoshi created several pictorial interpretations in different formats throughout his lifetime, which was likewise politically tumultuous. In this intimate fan format, they are depicted in the same loose but effective manner as the bamboo setting, thereby suggesting their affinity with nature."
Sea_of_Trees_by_the_Heavenly_Lake,"The remote Changbai Mountain in Jilin Province, on the border with North Korea, is not a familiar tourist destination nor is it a common theme for artists. As Fu had remarked, “Visiting the Changbai Mountain is not easy; reaching the ‘Heavenly Lake’ [at the mountaintop] is even more difficult. Traveling to this astonishing and superb place is the best event in one’s whole life.” It took Fu five days to complete this remarkable painting, which portrays the lake surrounded by an expansive forest in what appears to be a topographically accurate rendering as if seen from the air."
Night_Rain_in_the_Mountains_of_Sichuan,At the center of this intriguing work is a voyeuristic vision of a beautiful lady sitting pensively in candlelight on a stormy night. We gaze into her boudoir through the web of windblown bamboo leaves and an elegant moon-window that is screened by nearly transparent bamboo blinds and a parted gauze curtain. These multiple visual barriers make her emblematic of an aesthetic ideal that is hard to attain. Her delicacy and solitude stand out in sharp relief against the natural turbulence that surrounds her.
Viewing_a_Painting,"This painting celebrates the scholarly pastime of gentlemen appreciating works of art. The men view a painting in front of a low table set with antique bronzes and scrolls that await their perusal. Ingeniously, the screen behind the men provides another glimpse into their elegant lifestyle by depicting scholars engaged in a chess game. But while Fu’s subjects are the traditional cultural pursuits of the literati, his realistic shading of the figures’ faces reveals the influence of Western artistic techniques that he learned during his sojourn in Japan."
Red_Cliff_Village,"Represented here is a site in Chongqing that Fu did not consider a suitable painting subject until he viewed it again from his new political perspective. In his inscription, Fu writes:Red Cliff Village, located near the Hualong Bridge in Chongqing, was the headquarters of a bureau of the Communist Party’s Central Committee during the Sino-Japanese War. Some of the leading figures of the reactionary [Nationalist] Party lived in the vicinity. The marker under the banyan tree pointed the way. To the right was headquarters; to the left, enemy [Nationalist] territory. Imagine the intensity of the conflicts. Thus the masses call it yinyang tree. I had passed by this spot once or twice in the past, but only recorded it now, after 14 years."
Snow:_Poetic_Thoughts_of_Mao_Zedong,"Here, Fu rendered a panorama of a snowy landscape in an impressionistic manner. Mountains and rivers are conveyed with swift, scribbling strokes over blank areas of shimmering white—all full of vital energy. Mao Zedong stands on a mountaintop, taking in the vista, as a soldier behind him carries a revolutionary flag—a modern, radical twist on the old pictorial convention of a recluse seeking solace in nature with an attendant who follows him carrying a qin, or zither. This fantastic snowy scene anticipates the famous work Such Is the Beauty of Our Rivers and Mountains, which is based on the same poem."
Landscape,"Painting materials were not easy to acquire during the war, but kindred souls still shared them. Fu’s inscription tells us that he painted this landscape after receiving a gift of old ink cakes from a friend. The painting was also done to remember another deceased friend who had offered him ink. Fu adds, “These ink cakes may not have been considered marvelous in the past; today, when given, they are as precious as one hundred friends.” Here, the portrayal of light and atmosphere through a consummate control of richly graduated ink washes is indebted to the Japanese artist Takeuchi Seiho (1864–1942)."
The_Three_Laughers_at_Tiger_Creek,"The Buddhist monk Huiyuan (334–416) led a reclusive life and forbade himself from going beyond Tiger Creek. One day he was visited by the Confucian poet Tao Qian (365–417) and the Daoist Lu Xiujing (406–477), and the three men became deeply absorbed in conversation. When Huiyuan strolled with his guests to say farewell, he did not realize he had walked over the creek, causing his tiger to raise a roar of alarm—hence, the spontaneous laughter of the three men. The story is often treated delightfully in painting, with special emphasis on the moment of laughter and awakening, as seen here."
Evening_Rain_in_the_Ba_Mountains,"The artistic conception of this work can be inferred from Fu’s inscription on another version on the same theme, in which he writes, “I have been in Shu [Sichuan] for almost five years, residing on the lower slope of Jin’gangpo. . . . For nearly twenty days there has been persistent rain. The drops pattering on the low houses have stirred the feelings of this sojourner. Last night [my wife] Shihui and I talked about our moves since the outbreak of war. We conceived this painting together to commemorate these days.”"
Mountain_Spirit,"This painting was inspired by a shamanistic song from the ancient literary work Nine Songs, attributed to Qu Yuan (343–278 B.C.). It describes a mountain spirit “driving tawny leopards and striped lynxes” who takes a perilous path to meet a lover but is late for the tryst. The poem describes the scene:The thunder rumbles; rain darkens the sky:The monkeys chatter; apes scream in the night:The wind murmurs sadly and the trees rustle.I think of my lady and stand alone in sadness.—Trans. Joseph Minford and Joseph S. M. LauFu inscribed the full text of the song along the right side of the painting. On the left he states, “Of all the versions I have painted, this one is relatively satisfactory.”"
Mount_Yuntai,"Fu Baoshi’s interest in art history is demonstrated by this work, a pictorial reconstruction of an ancient text by Gu Kaizhi (ca. 345–406) titled “Essay on Painting Yuntai Mountain.” The essay—inscribed in full on the painting—is a literary description of how a painter should create a landscape by incorporating various scenes. In conducting his own research on the text, Fu challenged existing Japanese interpretations. His efforts to construct an indigenous art history were also motivated by patriotic feelings aroused in response to China’s war with Japan."
Drunken_Monk,"The Tang Buddhist monk and calligrapher Huaisu (725–ca. 799), who often drank heavily to eliminate inhibitions before practicing calligraphy, composed the following poem in response to a painting of a drunken calligrapher-monk:Everybody delivers wine,It remains untouched.All day amid the pines hangs a bottle.The Cursive Script Sage goes mad as an inspiration comes.All is captured in the “Drunken Monk.”—Trans. Anita ChungFu Baoshi, who also sought uninhibited artistic liberation through wine, must have found this theme particularly appealing. His seal “Often after Becoming Drunk” is testament to his conviction that inebriation fostered spontaneous expression."
Riding_a_Donkey_Beneath_Bamboo,"This hanging scroll belongs to a set of four that represents Fu Baoshi’s earliest surviving work. Created for a private patron, each scroll bears a long inscription that identifies Fu’s source of inspiration—in this case, Mi Fu (1051–1107)—and reveals his art-historical approach to painting and fondness for the literati tradition. It reads:Gao Kegong [1248–1310] was the most remarkable among those following the style of Mi Fu. Dong Qichang [1555–1636], who grew up in Yunjian [present-day Shanghai], once remarked, “Later artists modeling after Mi Fu could only pile up the ink dots without imparting openness and closeness [as contrast]. The result was not satisfactory.” Baoshi.—Trans. Anita Chung"
After_Mao_Zedong’s_“Saying_Goodbye_to_the_God_of_Disease_(I)”,"This painting was inspired by the first of two poems by Mao on eradicating disease:And if the cowherd who lives on a starAsks about the god of plagues,Tell him, happy or sad, the god is gone,Washed away in the waters.In Fu’s illustration, a desolate scene of calamity is relieved by the appearance of the mythical herdboy announcing the arrival of better times."
Shaoshan,"In June 1959, at the invitation of the Hunan People’s Publishing House, Fu spent nine days in Shaoshan to highlight two major sites: Mao Zedong’s former residence and Shaoshan Mountain. The scroll opens on the right with a depiction of the magnificent emerald-green mountain rising above a valley dotted with the modern structures brought to the village under socialist reconstruction: a school, guesthouse, post office, cultural center, and the people’s commune. The culmination of the scroll on the left is Mao’s family residence, deliberately brought closer to the viewer for easy recognition."
Walking_with_a_Staff_and_Carrying_a_Zither,"Fu Baoshi’s inscription reads:Ni Zan [1306–1374] said, “What I call painting does not exceed the joy of careless sketching with the brush. I do not seek formal likeness but do it simply for my own amusement.” To evaluate painting, there were different categories of greatness: divine [shen], wonderful [miao], competent [neng], and effortless [yi]. Wasn’t the [eighth-century] critic Zhu Jingxuan perceptive in this regard? Painted during the yichou year [1925] for the advice of Mr. Zhenqing. Master of the Studio for Embracing Stones.—Trans. Anita Chung"
The_Poet_Qu_Yuan,"The poet-statesman Qu Yuan (343–278 B.C.) drowned himself to prove his moral purity and loyalty in the face of slander. Fu created this compelling image in response to a modern play about Qu Yuan by the historian, poet, and playwright Guo Moruo (1892–1978). Guo revived this historical theme to express both patriotic sentiments and criticism of China’s wartime politics. Capturing the psychological suffering of the poet before his suicide, Fu’s image expresses the grievances and pathos of intellectuals in the face of war and political corruption. The similarity of this composition with a work by Yokoyama Taikan (1868–1958) reveals Fu’s study of contemporary nihonga (Japanese-style paintings)."
Teapot_in_the_Shape_of_a_Plum_Blossom,The invention of the teapot is often credited to potters working in the Yixing district of Jiangsu Province sometime in the sixteenth century. It is thought that these potters adapted the shape of a wine ewer to meet the needs of tea aficionados who had begun using steeped leaves rather than powdered tea.
Playing_the_Qin_and_Watching_Geese_in_Flight,"Fu Baoshi's growing sense of isolation as the political situation worsened in 1948 is apparent in this painting, which he did in Nanjing in March of that year. The depiction of a scholar strumming a zither at the edge of a desolate flood plain crisscrossed with waterways was inspired by the story of Boya, a legendary zither player whose teacher brought him to the island of the immortals in order to teach him how to play expressively. In Fu's interpretation, the figure of Boya is silhouetted against a marshy expanse, while his servant, huddled against an embankment, appears oblivious to his master's playing. A delicate formation of descending geese, suspended in the moist atmosphere, evokes the fleeting tones of Boya's music. The figure's erect posture may signal Fu's resolve to continue working, even in the face of an uncertain future."
A_Glimpse_of_the_Coal_Capital,"Recalling his visit to the coal capital Fushun, in Liaoning Province, and the motivation for this painting, Fu wrote:I still remember vividly what the Party Secretary told me about . . . the coal mine. . . . Suddenly he pointed to the coal layers in the walls of the mine and said, “Look, how beautiful the color is!” I was terrified. . . . Everybody knows that coal is dark black. A mine operated by several hundred thousand miners was filled with coal mine dust, and yet, in the eye of our Party Secretary, it was so beautiful. How can I not paint this?"
Goddess_of_the_River_Xiang,"The youthful Fu Baoshi, fiercely idealistic and proud, often created images of unrecognized virtue, a theme that found its earliest expression in the poetry of Qu Yuan (343-278 B.C.), a loyal minister of the Chu kingdom who drowned himself in a tributary of the Xiang River in response to the false slander of his enemies.Here, Fu was inspired by verses from a cycle of poems entitled the Nine Songs that is traditionally attributed to Qu Yuan. The Xiang River, a major tributary of the Yangzi that ran through the state of Chu, was known to harbor a goddess in its depths. She surfaced and enchanted the poet, who swore to make her his bride. The moment of enchantment depicted by Fu is described by the poet::The Child of God, descending the northern bank,Turns on me her eyes that are dark with longing.Gently the wind of autumn whispers;On the waves of Dongting Lake the leaves are falling.(David Hawkes, trans., Ch'u Tz'u: The Songs of the South [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1959], p. 38)"
Summer_retreat_in_the_eastern_grove,"This poem, written in the running-script style of Huang Tingjian (1045–1105), is one of two poems by Wen appended to this painting. Both texts reveal Wen Zhengming's early study of the Northern Song master's large-scale calligraphy. Wen Zhengming devoted his life to the revival and creative reinterpretation of the expressive traditions of Song and Yuan painting and calligraphy. Wen particularly admired the writing style of Huang Tingjian, a passion he acquired from his mentor Shen Zhou (1427–1509). Wen's bold calligraphy stands in marked contrast to the officially sanctioned standard-script style practiced by court bureaucrats and reflects his independent nature.A final colophon by Wen explains the circumstances surrounding the poems' creation. Wen wrote the poems in 1512 for his friend Qian Tongai (1475–1549). The poems were subsequently acquired by Nanzhou, abbot of the Tianwang Temple. When Wen visited Nanzhou in 1515 he saw his poems and appended his colophon."
Two_Goats,"Wang Zhen's artistic training began under his father, who had a passion for painting. In 1882 Wang began to study formally; he was noticed by Ren Yi (1840–1895) and became his disciple. About 1914, shortly after Wu Changshi (1844–1927) arrived in Shanghai, Wang became his student. In spite of his travels to Japan and his exposure to Western culture, Wang did not adopt a Western-influenced style. He learned to master figural motifs and painterly effects from Ren Yi; from Wu Changshi he learned to practice a powerful calligraphic manner of brushwork.Two Goats recalls Ren Yi's Three Goats painted in 1878. Using Wu Changshi's round brushwork, Wang transformed Ren's more realistic representation into calligraphic pattern."
Orchids,"This exquisite representation of an orchid, signed by Ma Lin, son of Ma Yuan (act. ca. 1190-1225), exemplifies the style of formal realism favored by the aristocratic Southern Song court. The simple asymmetrical balance of flowers and leaves, meticulously rendered in subtle shades of lavender, white, and malachite green, bespeaks a consciously aestheticizing sensibility. Such flower paintings recall late Southern Song lyric poems about flowers."
Water_Buffalo_Under_a_Willow_Tree,"Qi's ability to reduce his depiction to a minimum and still convey meaning with a sense of humor is epitomized in this depiction of a water buffalo seen from the rear, its hindquarters forming a perfect circle from which tail, legs, horn, and muzzle and the dark line of a rope protrude. The ink used to describe the rump is mixed with water to create the appearance of fur. A broken horizon line bisects the beast, which would otherwise appear to be hovering like an inflated balloon. The attenuated form of a willow tree, its long stringy wisps seeming to flutter lightly in the breeze, contrasts with the sturdy immobility of the buffalo."
Quatrain_on_spring’s_radiance,"During the Southern Song, artists and connoisseurs who wished to express their emotional responses to paintings frequently added poems to them. Empress Yang's poems appear on a number of paintings by such court artists as Ma Yuan (active ca. 1190–1225) and Ma Lin (active ca. 1180–after 1256); this quatrain must once have complemented a fan painting of flowers, but it reveals more about the state of mind of the empress than about the lost painting it accompanied:My makeup worn and faded, only the scent lingers;Still I shall enjoy spring's beauty before my eyes.Once you said to me, how a year blooms quicklyand as quickly dies!Might we now forsake worldly splendors for theland of wine?"
Garden_of_the_Inept_Administrator,"The Garden of the Inept Administrator (Zhuozheng Yuan) was built on the site of an ancient temple in Suzhou by the censor Wang Xianchen (act. ca. 1500–1535). In 1527, after an unhappy stay in Beijing, the artist Wen Zhengming returned to Suzhou, where he was given a studio in the garden. In an album of 1535, Wen painted thirty-one views of the site, each accompanied by a poem and a descriptive note. Sixteen years later, at the age of eighty-one, he painted this second album of eight views. The garden still exists in Suzhou, but centuries of renovations make it difficult to identify Wen's scenes.In these works Wen achieved the ideal integration of the three separate arts of poetry, calligraphy, and painting (the so-called three perfections). With characteristic restraint, he chose to use only ink, but, aided by the poems, the quiet and exquisite images easily evoke that magical, autumnal moment in the garden.The Bank of Many FragrancesVarious kinds of flowers are planted next to thethatched hall,Purple luxuriance and red beauty in random array;The spring radiance and brilliance embroiders themwith a thousand artifices,In the good air and scented mist a hundredfragrances mix.I love the smells that fill my bosom and sleeves,I do not let the wind and dew wet my clothes,My thoughts fly high beyond the flowery world.Quietly, I watch the bees dance up and down.The Bamboo BankBamboos are planted around the low moundForming a bank of bamboo around the edge.In full summer it already seems to be autumn,So deep is the wood, one cannot tell when it is noon.In its midst is one who has abandoned the world,Enjoying himself with a lute and a goblet.When a wind stirs, he too wakes from drunkennessTo sit and listen to the rain on the bamboo leaves.The Canglang PavilionOnce a small pavilion was built by Canglang pond,*The green water still surrounds its empty railings;Here there are always wind and moon to offer tothe fisherman,And boys, too, singing “Wash your cap strings!”Rivers and lakes fill the whole land, enough formy enjoyment,For a hundred years the fish and birds haveforgotten themselves;Shunjing [Su Zimei, 1008–1048] is dead,Du Ling [Du Fu, 712–770] far away—As a paragon of hermits who will compete with me?*Confucius was said to have admired a song sungby a small boy:“When Canglang’s waters are clear, I wash mycap strings;When Canglang’s waters are muddy, I washmy feet.”Clear and muddy waters refer to good and badpolitical and social circumstances.The Banana BalustradeThe new banana is more than ten feet tall;After the rain it is clean as though washed.It does not dislike the high white wall,It elegantly matches the curved red balustrade.Cool autumn sounds come to my pillow,Green morning colors are seen through thewindows.Let no one take to the shears heedlessly,Leave it until its shade reaches my house.The Fishing StoneThe white stone is clean and dustless;Flat, it overhangs the stream of wild water.I sit and watch the line rolling,I take quiet pleasure in the jadelike turning[of the water].I enjoy rivers and lakes, far off,I forget cares, and gulls and egrets becometame friends.You must know that he who stretches his line,Is not one who desires [to catch] fish.The Apple GardenHere in summer a cool shade spreads over ten mu[of land]This is when the fruits begin to ripen in the longorchard;At the place where the precious baskets are dividedand given away,In a small window, I have got a rubbing of Youjun’s[Wang Xizhi’s] calligraphy.The Locust Tree PavilionBelow the pavilion a tall locust tree falls overthe wall,Mist on the cold leaves wets my clothes.The scattered flowers are sparse but their scenttravels far,The cool shade falls all around, of lasting benefitto the world.During the literary examinations of the eighthmoon, past achievements are recalled,When the honors of the three ministers areentrusted to the candidates.Since I became old I have not indulged in suchdreams,Alone I move my bed to lie in the cool of evening.The Jade SpringOnce I ladled water from the Fragrant HillsCool as a stream of jade*Would you know that as far as Yao [seventh starof the Big Dipper] is from the Milky WayThere is another clear jade spring?Preparing a rope, I draw water with the clouds,In an earthen jar, I boil it with moonlight.What need of Lu Hongjian [Lu Yu (d. 804), afamous tea master]?At the first sip you will yourself decide.*The Jade Spring is a famous water source located in the Fragrant Hills near Beijing."
"Rice_Culture,_or_Sowing_and_Reaping","Rice Culture depicts China's most fundamental economic activity: the cultivation and harvesting of rice. It is based closely on a set of texts and illustrations first created by the Southern Song court painter Lou Shou (1090–1162). The scroll, which preserves the final nine scenes from this series, bears an inscription, dated 1353, by a Mongolian named Hugechi that states that, after he acquired this painting, he had it remounted and presented it to the Grand Preceptor as a resource for establishing policy.The work not only documents the continuation of the Song-style court painting tradition but demonstrates how Mongol officials, in spite of their nomadic heritage, had come to appreciate both the fundamental nature of agriculture in Chinese society and its importance in sustaining the fiscal health of the dynasty."
Wilderness_Colors,"In the mid-1690s, after a life of wandering, Shitao settled permanently in Yangzhou, a bustling commercial city on the Grand Canal that eclipsed Suzhou during the eighteenth century as the most vigorous economic and cultural center in China. Renouncing his monastic vows and taking the name Dadizi, or ""Greatly Purified One,"" Shitao turned to painting as his sole means of support.In Wilderness Colors, each leaf offers something unexpected, not only in the painter's choice of subject and compositional arrangement but also in the subtle wit and touching personal insights revealed in the verbal and pictorial imagery. Many of the leaves were inspired by Du Fu (712–770) and Li Bo (701–762) of the Tang dynasty (618–907); others refer to personal experiences. In late-seventeenth-century criticism, an excess of technical versatility in painting was considered as bad as ""overcooked"" food. Shitao's lighthearted account of eating vegetables raw reveals his intention to maintain an uninhibited style all his own.Once Wang Anjie* presented me with a poem, saying: ""Get some spring water in your copper bowl and roast some taro on the earthen stove."" He truly understood me. But what a laughable, uncouth person I am! This year I greedily obtained some huge taro roots. They were too large to be roasted in a short time, so I ate them all partly raw. Can you guess what the temperature is inside my stomach?"
Garden_scene,"Wu Tao was one of the leading literati landscape painters of the late nineteenth century. In this album leaf, Wu applied his eye for landscape to the curated world of the garden, using saturated washes of light indigo and sienna to depict a tranquil scholar’s retreat."
Pine,"Chen Banding painted this amusing coup de theatre, according to his inscription, well into a long night of celebrating the birthday of Meilan Fang, a renowned Peking Opera star."
Woman_in_a_garden,"Chen Yunzhang (often referred to by his sobriquet Chen Shaomei) painted this melancholy woman in a garden in 1940, in the midst of World War II. Building on the traditions of late Qing paintings of women, Chen presents his subject as slender and graceful, lost in reverie as she contemplates a small stream that flows by a weeping willow. Chen was prominent in northern art circles leading up to and after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China; he eventually served as president of the Tianjin Fine Arts Academy."
Sunset_over_the_Plateaux_of_Southern_Shaanxi,"In this painting, a mule train moves slowly along a mountain path through a cornfield that appears brilliant red in the glow of sunset. During the Cultural Revolution, the color red symbolized new China and recalled the stirring lines of the revolutionary song: ""The East is Red, the sun rises; China has produced a Chairman Mao."" In Shi Lu's ominous landscape, however, it is the light of the setting sun that illuminates the fields, which appear like a brushfire about to consume the travelers. The mountains, like thick black smoke, offer no sanctuary from this conflagration."
Untitled,In this work there is a strong intimation of the sun shining through a dense fog and reflecting off a foreground expanse of water.
Ink_Tablet_Decorated_with_Five_Pines,"High-quality ink cakes produced by Cheng Junfangand Fang Yulu are often decorated with designs that have literary allusions. The motif of five pines on this ink cake is derived from the story of the first emperor's trop to Tai Mountain, where he was caught in a storm. He took shelter under an ancient pine tree, on which he later conferred the official title Wutafu. A later misunderstanding of this title gave rise to the motif of five pine trees. The black stag motif on the square ink cake. Nearby alludes to the stag-tail dusters used by scholars and to their brilliant conversations."
Fisherman's_Lodge_At_Mount_Xisai,"In this imaginary depiction of his retirement retreat the scholar-official Li Jie presents an image of his future home in a self-consciously primitive manner. The archaic, maplike image—composed of frontal, schematically rendered mountains and trees, an archaic ""blue-and-green"" color scheme, an uptilted ground plane, and sticklike architecture—directly recalls an early paradigm of the scholarly retreat: the Wangchuan Villa of the Tang poet-painter Wang Wei (699–759).Li Jie retired to Mount Xisai in 1184 after an illustrious official career but executed this work about 1170 in anticipation of his retirement, which did not occur until 1184. It was in 1170 that Li also began to solicit colophons to his painting from some of the leading figures of his day, including the statesman and poet Fan Chengda (1126–1193). The resulting combination of painting and poems forms a unique record of Southern Song scholarly collaboration in the creation of a pictorial and literary work that celebrates the ideal of retirement—a phenomenon that anticipates by nearly a century similar artistic collaborations among scholars living under the Mongol Yuan dynasty."
Landscapes_and_botanical_subjects,"This album comprises twelve paintings by the imperial clansman and first cousin of the Qianlong emperor Hongwu. The album alternates between antiquarian landscapes, in which the artist emulates the style of a range of old masters, and botanical subjects, which range from bamboo to chrysanthemum to evergreen. Each painting is accompanied by a poem."
"Letter_to_the_artist’s_father-in-law,_Wu_Yu","In the mid-sixteenth century, Wen Zhengming dominated the cultural life of Suzhou with his significant talents in poetry, painting, and calligraphy. This letter shows a different side of Wen, when he was young and his star was still on the rise. Writing in his mid-thirties to his father-in-law, he assumes the tone not of a leading cultural figure but a deferential and respectful junior. The fancy stationery with plum blossom design is another sign that Wen wanted his letter to make a good impression."
Flower_and_Toad,"Adapting the style of the 17th century artist Wang Wu to the bright palette and light-hearted spirit of the 19th century populists, Zhang has painted a delightful summery fan depicting a frog tethered to a bulb."
Flying_celestial_(apsara),"This figure was traced from one of the angelic musicians and dancers that adorn the south wall of Cave 285 at Dunhuang, which dates from the Western Wei dynasty (534–57)."
Landscapes_and_Flowers,"A native of Shexian, Anhui Province, Wang Shishen moved to Yangzhou by 1709 and made the acquaintance of Ma Yueguan (1687-1755), a salt merchant also of Anhui origin who was to become a leader of local scholarly and artistic circles. Their friend-patron relationship was important to Wang's career.Wang's painting is praised for its delicate touch and subtle lyricism, especially in his depictions of plum blossoms. Here they are rendered either alone or accompanied by other flowers. His terse, rhythmic brushwork contributes to the liveliness of all his floral images. Much rarer among Wang Shishen's extant works are landscapes. A major inspiration to him in this genre was Shitao (1642–1707), a celebrated master who lived in Yangzhou during the final decade of his life. Shitao's influence is particularly distinct in Wang's sensitive characterization of a lone wanderer in an atmospheric landscape."
Hands_and_donor_figure,"These studies of hands and a seated figure are so precise that they must have been traced from the original murals on which they are based. The seated female figure (a donor) is copied from an image on the east wall of Cave 329, Dunhuang."
Goddess_of_the_Xiang_River,"Fu Baoshi made ingenious use of the curved surface of the fan format to enhance the sensuous appeal of the Xiang River Goddess, a deity eulogized in Qu Yuan’s Nine Songs. Her downcast gaze points naturally toward the autumnal imagery in the lower left of the composition, while the hem of her flowing robe parallels the fan’s bottom edge. Qu Yuan’s text, partially transcribed here by Fu, reads:The Child of God, descending the northern bank,Turns on me her eyes that are dark with longing.Gently the wind of autumn whispers;On the waves of Dongting Lake the leaves are falling.—Trans. David HawkesFu dedicated this work to Lai Shaoqi (1915–2000), an artist known for his social-realist prints advocating nationalistic causes."
Poem_by_Wang_Wei_in_the_Style_of_Mi_Fu,"明 董其昌 倣米芾書王維詩 卷 絹本This work shows Dong Qichang at his freest, filling a long handscroll with exuberantly brushed oversized characters. The poem is by Wang Wei (699–759), but the calligraphy itself is inspired by Mi Fu (1051–1107), whom Dong greatly admired. It is not a careful copy of Mi Fu’s style, but an attempt to capture its spirit. The asymmetrical balance of some characters, the extensive use of the split-brush effect known as “flying white” (feibai), and the large scale of the characters are all homages to Mi Fu that bring Dong to the edge of his comfort zone, as he pushes himself to be less controlled and careful.The Metropolitan Museum has one of the only surviving works of large-scale calligraphy by Mi Fu."
Miniature_landscapes,"This tiny album was made for inclusion in a “treasure box,” one of the elaborate containers of precious objects that were favorites of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1736–95) of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Albums were particularly well-suited to satisfying Qianlong’s love of miniatures, but court painters like Zhang Zongcang were also required to produce tiny handscrolls for treasure boxes."
Myriad_Bamboo_in_Mist_and_Rain,"In this evocative landscape of brimming streams and dense bamboo, the animated texturing of the distant mountains captures the impression of coarse-surfaced rocks seen through rain. Fu made liberal use of varied ink washes and energetic brushstrokes to describe dagger-like bamboo leaves blowing in the shifting light and the agitated atmosphere of a summer storm.Tucked to the side of this turbulent scene, three scholars have found shelter in a rustic cottage. The tall black hat worn by the leftmost figure identifies him as Su Shi (1036–1101), a native of Sichuan beloved for his poetry, art, and devotion to civil service. One of Su’s close friends was Wen Tong (1019–1079), a renowned bamboo painter, whose presence is implied by the encircling bamboo forest."
Plum_blossoms,"Zhang Daqian, one of the most prominent artists in twentieth-century China, built on an extensive knowledge of premodern painting styles and techniques to forge his own modern path. Here, red plum blossoms on a gnarled tree branch are rendered in energetic lines with overlapping pools of ink and light blue. According to the artist’s inscription, this painting was executed in 1963 for his friend Ms. Li Deying (1913–2001) at his residence in S?o Paulo. Red plum blossom, a classic symbol of lofty elegance, is a perfect subject for a painting to be presented to a cherished friend."
"Paintings_after_Shitao's_""Wilderness_Colors""","Zhang Daqian was a great admirer and collector of the works of Shitao (1642–1707); he was also an accomplished forger of Shitao's paintings. These acknowledged copies provide an invaluable resource for connoisseurs of both artists' work. Zhang's paintings are undated, but the seals all bear legends that he used in the late 1920s and 1930s, when he was intensely interested in mastering Shitao's painting style.Zhang's interpretations are not slavish copies; rather, they are dashing sketches with their own energy and visual appeal. Nevertheless, Zhang's paintings are consistently simpler in execution, with fewer colors and less detail. A subtler difference is Zhang's tendency to transform Shitao's naturalistic, three-dimensional renderings into flat abstractions. A final telling difference between the two artists' work is the calligraphy. Each of Shitao's inscriptions draws inspiration from a different antique master; even within the same inscription, one can sense a variety of stylistic sources. Zhang's shorter inscriptions reflect his familiarity with Shitao's most characteristic writing style, but they lack the varied stylistic influences that distinguish Shitao's writing.(translations of calligraphic text on Zhang Daqien, Paintings after Shitao's ""Wilderness Colors"", about 1930, ink and color on paper)Taro RootsEating even one half [of a taro root is better than] receiving the post of prime minister for ten years.BambooThe wind has diminished after sweeping away the layered clouds;Alone with an open mind I enter the woods.While the phoenix remains hidden the tree bears few red fruits [i.e., the times are not propitious];But I won't let the struggling yellow disturb my contemplative state of mind.Painted by Qingxiang Laoren [Shitao]; copied by DaqianEggplantsYear after year as summer approaches I am proud of my new harvest,But I act like [Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) of] Wuxing in the Zhijun Studio.This purple color is not the same as that of leaves after frost,Holding the handle [of my hoe] I join my friends in the fields.Orchid and RockWhen one speaks of picking flowers to present;If not to a gentleman, then to whom?"
Woman_in_a_garden,"Qian Huian says this figure is ""done in the style of Tang Yin"" (1470–1523), but the echo is so faint as to require the inscription to call it to mind. Rather, this meticulously styled beauty with her large head, wraithlike form and delicate features is an unmistakable late 19th century romantic creature. Qian Huian’s influential style, promulgated by his many students and through his popular painting manual, led to the appearance of similar beauties on fans, calendars and painted snuff bottles, as well as in paintings.Qian Huian’sreferences to orthodox painters like Tang Yin and the literary inscriptions he frequently added to his paintings made them attractive to patrons aspiring to literati taste."
Landscape,"Two gentlemen sit in a waterside pavilion. One has a stack of books by his side; the other holds a fan as they converse. Attendants come and go with wine or tea and a zither (qin), the musical instrument considered most appropriate for use by scholar-amateurs. Although the landscape beyond shows a broad river bounded by distant hills, the scene strongly evokes the atmosphere of a garden, in which strategically placed pavilions served as stage sets for elegant gatherings."
Eight_views_of_the_Yellow_Mountains,"In the seventeenth century, painters from Anhui began to exploit the album’s special qualities to represent the Yellow Mountains (Huangshan), vista by vista, one leaf at a time. This example, by the relatively little-known artist Zheng Min, ranks among the best Huangshan albums; its compositional originality and subtle brushwork unfolds over a journey of eight distinct parts. Zheng Min combined the signature dry brush technique of the Anhui School’s founder Hongren with subtle ink washes to create a less austere, more descriptive style. Adding to the album’s appeal is the artist’s lengthy inscription, on the final leaf,which explains the story of the album’s creation.In this long inscription, written to accompany the album, Zheng Min explains the circumstances of its creation: [Summary]: In 1681, Zheng was approached by a younger friend named Chuzhen, who asked the master to paint two albums: one for him, and one for a friend. He obliged, painting this album for Chuzhen in the hopes of spurring his interest in Mount Huang, where the young man had never been. Zheng Min himself had been there only twice, the most recent trip more than seven years earlier. He painted this album from memory. In his inscription, he writes, “In the future, after all his children get married, if Chuzhen ever travels there, I hope he will take this album with him to check against the actual sites. I will then become his tour guide.”—Trans. by Shi-yee Liu"
Viewing_plum_blossoms_by_moonlight,"Crafted as carefully as the regulated verse of a Tang dynasty quatrain, Ma Yuan's Viewing Plum Blossoms by Moonlight is a visual poem evoking a complex sense of time, place, and mood. The browns and blacks in the trees and rocks contrast with the light grayish hues of the cliff and mountain to suggest the mist-filled, moonlit atmosphere of an early spring evening. The thatch roof of a pavilion identifies the place as a garden setting. The white-robed gentleman, framed by the dark angular forms of the landscape, perfectly counterbalances the moon in its setting of limitless space. Recalling a yin-yang cosmic diagram with its implication of positive within negative, light within dark, solid within void, the painting may be read as an emblem of man's dual nature: tied to the physical world, man's spirit is not contained by it but, like the plum, reaches upward to partake of the infinite."
Landscapes_after_old_masters,"Hailed as ""the foremost painter after Shen Zhou [1427-1509]"" by the collector-critic Zhou Lianggong (1612-1672), Yun Xiang was an influential forerunner of such leading early Qing Nanjing painters as Gong Xian (1619-1689).Living in retirement after the Manchu conquest as an yimin, or ""leftover subject,"" of the Ming, Yun Xiang especially admired the dry-brush manner of Ni Zan (1306-1374), the archetypal reclusive scholar-painter of the late Yuan period. Three of the ten paintings in this virtuoso album, in which Yun Xiang interprets a wide range of earlier masters' styles through remarkable variations in brushwork and compositional motifs, were inspired by Ni Zan. The methods of interpretation, bearing the unmistakable influence of the late Ming theorist-painter Dong Qichang (1555-1636), were further developed by Gong Xian and other leading early Qing masters in the late seventeenth century."
Wandering_in_a_Cloud-Filled_Valley,"Pu Ru, a Manchu prince who lived through the fall of the Qing dynasty, was a classical scholar, poet, calligrapher, and painter. Although he disliked being referred to as an artist, his fame today rests on his painting. Typically, Pu worked in the academic style of the Song dynasty (960–1279), which combined descriptive representation with atmospheric effects, but he often adapted and integrated the Song manner, as he did here, by incorporating later interpretations of that style by such Ming-dynasty artists as Tang Yin (1470–1523).The powerful pines depicted here may have had a very specific association for Pu Ru. After the Manchu dynasty was overthrown, he was forced to live at a Buddhist temple in the Western Hills near Beijing that was surrounded by them. He repeatedly recalled these pines in paintings and nostalgic writings later in his life. Pu inscribed this work with a quatrain:White clouds fill my hut by the cliff;The sound of a stream fills the empty valley.Whence came this person into the mountains?Forgetting the schemes of the world he befriends the deer.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)He embellished his inscription with an oval seal that reads ""a piece of red cloud,"" which is impressed on portions of its first two characters, baiyun (white clouds). Due to its color and location, this seal literally looks like a red cloud floating above the pines, graphically blurring the boundary between text and image."
Landscape_with_figure,"Nothing is known of Chen Jichun, who painted this fan in the waning years of the Ming dynasty. A red-robed scholar sits in a humble thatched pavilion beneath towering pines, frequently used symbols of virtuous character. The ropy, layered brushstrokes used to texture the rock and mountain surfaces call to mind the fourteenth-century painter Wang Meng."
Poems,"明 文徴明 行書自書詩 卷 紙本The dean of the Suzhou cultural scene during the sixteenth century, Wen Zhengming was admired in equal measure for his painting and calligraphy. In calligraphy, his reserved personality found form in stable compositions and elegantly smooth brushwork that was accomplished but never showy. In this scroll, written in the prime of his career, he transcribed nearly twenty of his own poems in his celebrated semicursive script. While the subtly nuanced poems attest to his stature as a leader of the local literate elite, the calligraphy embodies the ideal union of virtuosity and grace."
Letter_by_Li_Zhi,"In 1693 Zhu Da began studying works from the Chunhuage tie, a collection of rubbings of early calligraphies compiled in 992. This fan transcribes on piece from that collection, a letter from Li Zhi, who later became the emperor Tang Gaozong (r. 650–83). Zhu Da's writing freely departs from Li Zhi's original: done with plump ""centered-tip"" brushstrokes, Zhu's characters possess a simple, unaffected archaic flavor that is unmistakably his own.Zhu Da's transcription of Li Zhi's letter reads: Uncle, you possess a great many artistic talents and you are an outstanding, compassionate teacher. Your son Ai has thus received an exemplary education and he is receptive and diligent, especially in calligraphy. When I heard that he had lately become particularly fond of the ""Flying white"" technique, I playfully took up my brush to amuse him. What I wrote is far from the graceful forms of the Six Calligraphic Modes and remiss in elegant diction. Yet, soon afterward I received your letter in which you so generously praised my work. In truth, the work is mere ""ink traces"" and does not deserve such attention. Reading your letter repeatedly only added to my embarrassment."
Ink_Meditation,"Ink Meditation exemplifies Wang Dongling’s innovative abstraction of calligraphy in a monumental vertical format. Instead of focusing on the execution of individual brushstrokes, the artist draws attention to the negative space that enlivens the otherwise monolithic picture. Wielding an oversize brush, most of the composition is black, leaving only a few uninked areas of white ground at the center and corners."
Peaks_near_the_Cloud_Boat_residence,"Xuezhuang was one of a group of seventeenth-century painters who took special inspiration from the scenery of the Yellow Mountains (Huangshan). A Buddhist monk, the artist spent the last three decades of his life in a simple residence there. He called his home the Cloud Boat, a reference to the sea of clouds that would regularly sweep into the valley below. He painted this view from his bedroom, likely in direct response to the scenery."
Map_of_China,"This map of China is constructed out of interlocking wood elements salvaged from destroyed temples of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). The work is a poignant assertion that modern China is a mosaic of fragments from its past. The jigsaw-puzzle-like configuration of its heterogeneous pieces may also be read as a symbol of China’s cultural and ethnic diversity, asserting that while China remains distinctly singular, it is a fusion of countless individuals. Ai’s Map challenges our ability to imagine how such a complex state came into existence, how it has managed to survive for so long, and whether or not it can be maintained."
Han_Jar_Overpainted_with_Coca-Cola_Logo,By branding a Western Han dynasty (206 B.C–A.D. 9) jar with the Coca-Cola logo—the quintessential emblem of global consumerism—Ai provokes viewers to recognize how China’s engagement with the West has had both destructive and creative consequences.
"Butterflies,_Bird,_Lotus,_and_Rock,_after_Chen_Hongshou","Xie must have been pleased with this careful tracing, as he took the trouble to add washes in select areas."
"Rock,_Bamboo,_and_Bird_on_a_Branch,_after_Chen_Hongshou","The jagged contours of the rock, triangular fallen leaves, and gnarled branches are all hallmarks of the stylized manner of Chen Hongshou (1599–1652) whose signature in the upper right corner Xie has also copied."
Landscape_Sketches,"The highly abbreviated landscapes in these drawings, which probably date from the late 1950s or early 1960s, stand in marked contrast to Xie's precisely rendered sketches of the 1930s. As examples of Xie's mature work, they show him confidently extrapolating simplified compositions from a welter of scenery."
Boats_and_Figures,This sketch served as the basis for a clean copy (2005.411.13) in which Xie removed the traces of the gangplank visible here.
"Camellia,_Rock,_and_Butterfly,_after_Chen_Hongshou","This tracing bears no signature, but its subject matter and painting style suggest that it derives from a work by Chen Hongshou (1599–1652)."
Sketch_of_a_Child,"Xie's humorous comment accompanying this sketch reads: ""The rotten-nosed captain."" At some point, Xie used charcoal to draw the joint of a bamboo stalk in one corner of the page."
Orchids,"The naturalistic details indicate that Xie drew these flowers from life, and his beautiful brush lines reveal his consummate skill as a draftsman."
Landscape_in_the_Style_of_Dong_Qichang,"A simple dwelling nestles at the foot of a small mountain by a grove of towering trees. Nearby, a traveler crosses a humble wooden bridge. The hills that rise above the scene are rendered in layers of looping, wet strokes of ink, blue, and sienna. Here and there, dots of red are applied to indicate autumn foliage.The artist’s inscription at upper right offers an insightful comment about the artist, Dong Qiquang (1555–1636) and two of his close followers and sometimes “substitute brushes”, Zhao Zuo (ca. 1570–after 1630) and Shen Shichong (act. ca. 1607–40):Dong Xuanzai’s [Dong Qichang] paintings are vigorous and moist due to his way of applying texture strokes and washes. Zhao Wendu [Zhao Zuo] and Shen Ziju [Shen Shichong] were trivial and weak. They brought about many of the bad habits of the Yunjian School. Because their brush strength was insufficient, they concealed [their strokes] with ink. Binhong.-Translation after Keita Itoh and Lawrence Wu"
Scholar_viewing_a_waterfall,"Ma Yuan, a fourth-generation member of a family of painters, was a leading artist at the Southern Song painting academy in Hangzhou. A city of unsurpassed beauty, Hangzhou was graced with pavilions, gardens, and scenic vistas. In this album leaf, which shows a gentleman in a gardenlike setting, the jagged rhythms of the pine tree and garden contrast with the quiet mood of the scholar, who gazes pensively into the bubbling rapids of the cascade."
Landscape,"Traditional methods of landscape painting are invoked by Hu in this fan. Mountain forms are built using a system of brush dabs, while forests are created by an assembly of ideogram trees. Dilute ink and pale colors soften the rigor of the traditional conception, producing work with an easy popular appeal.In 19th century China, there were no museums and few galleries dedicated to the exhibition and sale of paintings. Artists like Hu displayed their pictures and listed their prices for commission work, usually based on size, in fan shops, mounters' shops and stationery stores."
Sailing_in_Autumn,"Zhu Xubai joined the imperial army in 1851, but, finding that his sympathies lay with the Taiping rebels, he deserted and became a monk, taking the name Xu Gu. Alienated and without roots, he traveled between Yangzhou, Suzhou, and Shanghai selling his paintings. He had been trained in a portrait shop to paint the realistic ancestor images much in demand, but the majority of his paintings give little evidence of traditional training. His creativity lies in devising a light coloristic means of rendering the impression of things as they are seen.In the 1870s and 1880s figure painting in Shanghai was dominated by Ren Yi (1840–1896) and landscape painting, by Xu Gu. Xu's fresh artistic vision offered realistic scenery rather than idealized landscapes. In this riverside scene, his sketchy impression of lowland grasses and shrubs is novel in its use of irregular, loosely connected strokes rather than traditional formulas for constructing organic units. In the foreground the ink is dry, in the distance wet and blurred, in order to render the effects of intervening mist. Xu attempted to paint what he saw, a goal independently pursued by the European Impressionists. His radical departure from traditional intent and technique gives his pictures a vivid immediacy."
Chrysanthemum,"According to the inscription, this fan, which Qi Baishi entitled ""Autumn Color"" in large seal-script characters, was painted when he was ninety-five sui. Qi was actually ninety-one at the time."
Studying_a_painting,"Zhang Lu was an aristocrat born into a wealthy family and educated with princes of the imperial family. He attained great success as a professional painter but lived very simply, almost as a hermit. He began his study of painting by emulating the leading court painter, Wang E (act. ca. 1490–after 1541), but quickly turned from the academy to other models and masters, most notably Wu Wei (1459–1508). This painting parodies the theme of the literary gathering. A group of rustics congregates around a hanging scroll as a man seated on a stone table holds forth on its virtues. A woman seated at her loom cranes her neck for a better view, a fisherman skeptically strokes his whiskers, a child darts underneath the scroll for a closer look, and the barefoot man unrolling the scroll squints critically at the image—a hawk pursuing a rabbit—which is a well-known composition by Zhang Lu himself."
Dish_with_Gardenia,"Pomegranate, persimmon, grapes, and lotus surround the gardenia in the center of this dish. All of the flowers are auspicious: the gardenia symbolizes honor and happiness because its Chinese name, furong, is a homonym for these virtues."
Misty_Bamboo_on_a_Distant_Mountain,"Zheng Xie passed the civil-service examination in 1736 and was appointed as magistrate in north China. Sympathetic with the plight of the people then in the throes of starvation, Zheng enforced extreme measures to improve their situation that met with resistance from the wealthier citizens in the area. His disillusionment with bureaucratic ethics, his disintegrating health, and his reputation tainted by scandal forced Zheng into early retirement. He settled in Yangzhou, then a prosperous community supportive of artists, where he became known as one of the Eight Eccentrics.This monumental four-panel painting depicts a grove of bamboo growing on a mountainside. The shallow pictorial space is defined by the placement of the stalks, which jut into view from the bottom of the composition, climb up the paper as if ascending a slope, and extend well beyond the top of the picture. It is further defined by the dramatic use of graded ink washes—from jet black to pale gray—that suggest the veiling effects of a dense mist. The artist inscribed the painting twice: in the upper right, with a title and date, and at the lower left, with his signature and seals."
Dish_of_Iced_Summer_Fruit,"Ding Fuzhi, primarily a bibliophile in the tradition of his distinguished family, painted only occasionally, but works such as these album leaves were appreciated by his contemporaries. While working in Shanghai's flourishing publishing industry, he designed a typeface adapted from the standard style of the Song master calligrapher Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) and brought out important editions in this handsome script. His seal-carving style followed that of the Zhe School, with its short rough strokes, and he published several books on the art of seal carving."
Comb_top,"From the late eighth to the tenth century, it was fashionable for Chinese women to wear decorated combs as part of their coiffure. Comb tops were made of such precious materials as gold, silver, jade, and mother-of- pearl and were ornamented with popular decorative motifs."
Boating_beneath_Echo_Hill,"Mei Qing was born into a prominent family in Xuancheng, Anhui Province. Following the family tradition of scholarship, Mei passed the provincial (jüren) civil-service examination in 1654 and traveled to the capital to sit for the capital (jinshi) examination, which he took and failed four times, before giving up in 1667. Mei returned home and became involved in local scholarly pursuits and participated in a poetry and painting society to which the painter Shitao (1642–1707) also belonged.This painting commemorates an outing that Mei and family members and friends made to Echo Hill (Xiangshan). Mei and some of the participants inscribed poems on the painting to further celebrate the occasion. Although the name of the recipient has been effaced, two seals belonging to Zheng Min (1633–1683), a noted painter from the Yellow Mountain region of Anhui, suggest that it may have been intended for him.Throughout his career, Mei drew inspiration from actual topographic features. Here, he emphasizes Echo Hill’s precipitous cliff face overhanging the river. Although a relatively early work, the painting exhibits the hallmarks of Mei’s eccentric style: an unbalanced composition animated by the powerful thrusting shape of the cliff and an interest in contrasting ink tones and textures, as seen in the way the dry-brush contour lines of the landscape are set off by the delicate blades of grass and dark ink foliage dots."
Fruit,"With the discovery of oracle-bone scripts at the turn of the twentieth century, painting was stimulated by another wave of influence from calligraphy.The pictograms—functioning as word, image, and concept—were an important stimulus for Ding Fuzhi. His inscription on this painting is composed of characters adapted from Shang oracle bones.Ding depicted the characteristic silhouette of each piece of fruit, consciously playing the naive quality of the painted image against its counterpart, the primitive script. At the same time, his command of oracle-bone script and his analytic understanding of form as color are utterly sophisticated."
"Two_Prose_Poems:""Mt._Tiantai""_and_""Parrot""","明 董其昌 小楷天台鸚鵡二賦 冊 紙本The seventeenth-century interest in eccentricity and innovation was in part a reaction to Dong Qichang achievements, which took the elegance of the classical tradition to such heights that some felt there was nothing left to achieve. These albums capture Dong’s understated sophistication as well as his somewhat regimented style. The characters are arranged meticulously into rail-straight columns of twelve. The structures of the characters themselves are supremely balanced between top and bottom, left and right. The brushwork is precise yet fluid. The ink, rich but with a hint of tonal variation and transparency, is of the highest quality.Displayed here are pages from two separate but related albums: one is handwritten by Dong Qichang and the other is a rubbing taken from it. Studying the work of great calligraphers, both past and present, was of critical importance in learning calligraphy. Since the majority of calligraphers did not have access to genuine works, they had to rely on other sources, such as rubbings. To create a rubbing, the original calligraphy was traced, then transferred and carved onto a stone or woodblock, from which many impressions could be made and studied. This technology also allowed calligraphers in pre-modern China to gain empire-wide fame in their own lifetime through reproductions of their work. Dong’s calligraphy consists of partial transcriptions of two rhymed prose poems entitled “Mt. Tiantai” and “ Parrot,” composed by Sun Chuo (314–371) and Mi Heng (173–198), respectively."
Searching_the_Mountains_for_Demons,"Zheng Zhong, a professional painter from Anhui, practiced his art in the cosmopolitan city of Nanjing. Zheng was skilled in the blue-and-green style of landscape and in Buddhist subjects that he could paint in either an intricate or an expressive manner, much like his more famous contemporaries specializing in Buddhist subjects, Wu Bin (act. ca. 1583–1626) and Din Yunpeng (1547–ca. 1621).Searching the Mountain for Demons illustrates the popular legend of the god Erlang, who was credited with defeating a vicious flood-arousing dragon and other demonic creatures on Mount Guankou in Sichuan. The god represents a metamorphosis of Li Bing, who helped control flooding and established a system of irrigation when he served as governor of Chengdu in the third century B.C., and of a regional hunting deity known for his control over mountain animals. The cult of Erlang became popular in Sichuan under the patronage of the later Shu emperor Meng Chang (r. 934–65). In 965, when the Song dynasty conquered the kingdom, it adopted the cult, erecting temples to the god in the capital and throughout China. The first illustration of Searching the Mountain appeared in the tenth century; today, two Southern Song and six Ming versions—including this one—are known."
"Recluse_Fisherman,_Autumn_Trees","Inscribed by the artist: ""On the fourth day of the sixth lunar month of the jichou year of the Zhizheng reign era [June 19, 1349], Sheng Mou, Zizhao of Wutang, painted this Recluse Fisherman, Autumn Trees.""In the Yuan period, the recluse fisherman became the symbol of the unemployed scholar, out of work either by choice or because traditional employment through the civil service examination was unavailable to him. The true hermit-scholar ""fished for fish and not for fame;"" others merely pretended to fish while waiting to return to politics."
Landscape,"In the late seventeenth century, a group of painters who have come to be known as the “Four Wangs” built upon Dong Qichang’s legacy to bring energy and excitement to the study of old master styles. The youngest of these, Wang Yuanqi, exerted a great influence on younger painters, including his grandson Wang Chen, whose fan you see here. Wang worked in a loose, wet version of his grandfather’s manner; he achieved enough fame in his own right to be counted among a group known as the “Lesser Four Wangs” who carried the original Four Wangs’ legacy forward into the nineteenth century."
Autumn_landscape_with_egrets_and_ducks,"Lü Ji, a professional painter from Zhejiang Province, worked in the Southern Song (1127–1279) ink-wash style, which had remained popular in that region through the intervening centuries. He was summoned to be a court painter in the Hongzhi period (1488–1505) and was given an honorary title as an officer in the imperial guard. The artist's paintings, done in a dashing descriptive style that was highly regarded at court, were derided by Shen Zhou (1427–1509), the leading scholar-painter of the time, as being merely works ""of the hand""; Shen considered his own calligraphic drawings to be products ""of the heart."" The contrast between the hand and the heart highlights the presumed difference between the works of the ""professional"" artists and those of the ""scholar-amateur"" painters of the Ming period."
Bamboo_and_poem,"Zhu Lu was an impoverished scholar from Suzhou who devoted himself to bamboo painting and poetry. This folding fan combines the two into an elegant composition: a wispy tendril of young bamboo reaches in from the right side, pointing toward the artist’s poem, which reads, in part:New branches, half newly grown green sheaves;Jade feeling, how richly shaped and carved!I linger, come to hidden blue-green colors;Here all suits my heart, nothing is at odds.—Translation by Jonathan Chaves"
Farewell_by_a_Stream_on_a_Clear_Day,"Zhao Yuan was a member of Suzhou literary circles and a close friend of many late Yuan scholar-painters, including Ni Zan (1306-1374) and Wang Meng (ca. 1308-1385).Farewell by a Stream on a Clear Day is painted in a style similar to that of Wang Meng. Wang's powerfully expressive brushwork here becomes a vivacious pictorial surface. Zhao's use of dots is especially remarkable; varying in size, shape, darkness, and touch, they not only serve a representational function but also effectively control the overall texture and tonality of the painting. Zhao Yuan's career, like that of many other notable Jiangnan painters, was cut short by the first Ming emperor (r. 1368-98), a man of humble origins who was deeply suspicious of the Suzhou intelligentsia. After summoning Zhao to Nanjing to serve as a painter, the emperor took offense at something Zhao did and had him executed."
Poems_dedicated_to_Shen_Shiyou,"清 王鐸 草書贈沈石友詩 卷 絹本Wang Duo reveled in the accidental effects of saturation, particularly on satin, where the ink would absorb into the weave in strange and compelling ways. Throughout this long handscroll, at the points where Wang paused to reload his brush, the ink bleeds and pools, in some cases nearly obscuring the character he has written. Compare this to the supremely controlled application of ink by Dong Qichang. These two men represent opposite ends of the aesthetic spectrum of seventeenth-century calligraphy, from rough eccentricity of Wang Duo to elegant control of Dong Qichang."
Sparse_trees_and_pavilion,"Wang Meng painted and inscribed this fan for the poet Chen Ruzhi (1329–1385) about 1361, when Chen came to the Hangzhou area to escape rebel uprisings near his home in Lushan, Jiangsu Province. This intimate painting and poem portray Chen as Wang knew him—as a homeless refugee living in rustic seclusion near Wang's home at Yellow Crane Mountain. Wang's poem reads:In the empty grove the whistling wind makes the leaves dance;The thatch pavilion is lonely under the noonday sun.All day long a southerly wind ripples the green waves;In a gauze cap of coarse hemp one feels no trace of summer's heat.This rustic's dwelling is near Yellow Crane Peak;In the evening he enters a deserted grotto and listens to the mountain rain."
Eight_Poems_on_Autumn_Moods,"明 王鐸 行書秋興八首 卷The original “Eight Poems on Autumn Moods,” by Du Fu (712–770), is a meditation on seasonal melancholy and expresses concerns over China’s fate during a time of national peril. Wang Duo too lived in a time of turmoil, and he was inspired by Du Fu to create his own set of “Autumn Moods.” Wang’s insertion of explanatory comments between the poems in much smaller characters not only creates a visual demarcation but also a sense of intimacy, as though he is whispering secrets to the viewer. Wang’s rejection of classical elegance is evident throughout this scroll, in his habit of letting the brush dry out almost completely before reloading it; in his abrupt, angular turns at the end of characters; and in his irregular character sizing and lineation."
Eight_poems,"明 熊廷弼 行書八詩 卷 紙本After passing the highest level of imperial examinations, Xiong Tingbi built a career as a military leader. He rose to take charge of military affairs in the northeast, where he was tasked with defending the Great Wall against the Manchus, who would ultimately invade China and found the Qing dynasty. After early success in strengthening local defense, Xiong was accused of deserting his post in battle and was executed unjustly in 1625.Though not well known as a calligrapher, Xiong had a confident and bold hand. In this work, he transcribes eight of his poems on a monumental scale. Over thirty feet long with each character nearly five inches tall, the work represents a challenge to the mainstream genteel aesthetic of the time. It is tempting to see some of the general’s martial spirit in the broad, sweeping strokes."
Peach_Blossom_Spring,"清 何焯 楷書桃花源記 軸 紙本The most legible of all the script types, standard script developed in the third century and remains in use today. If semicursive and cursive scripts allow the calligrapher to display expressive brushwork, with standard script the calligrapher is able to showcase less flashy but equally important skills: compositional balance and orthodox brushwork. Here, the Qing dynasty court calligrapher He Zhuo does so in his transcription of the poem “Peach Blossom Spring” by Tao Yuanming (365–427). The structure of each character is spacious yet solid, while the brushwork is simultaneously strong and fluid."
Poem,"清 鄭燮 行書詩 卷 絹本Zheng Xie was one of a group of calligraphers in eighteenth-century Yangzhou who looked to the distant past for inspiration. Dissatisfied with what he saw as futile attempts to recapture the elegance of Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322) and Dong Qichang (1555–1636), Zheng went in the other direction, seeking to achieve a sense of na?veté and awkwardness in his writing by incorporating elements of ancient stone inscriptions. This work is a mature example of Zheng’s accomplishments: blunt yet fluid, it is written in a hybrid script of his own creation that lies somewhere between regular and clerical, with touches of cursive and semicursive. Zheng called his creation “six-and-a-half script.” The text is composed of biographies of fifteen artists and writers that Zheng feared would be forgotten to history if he did not record them."
Instructions_on_Painting_Plum_Blossoms,"清 何紹基 隷書畫梅訣 卷 紙本Handscrolls were rarely used by Epigraphic School calligraphers, whose oversized characters and high-impact graphic forms generally called for larger formats. He Shaoji breaks with that trend here, inscribing a text on the proper technique for painting plum blossoms in clerical script, with two large characters per line. Handscrolls are intended to be viewed on a table at arm’s length, and He Shaoji’s powerful, archaic forms and bold brushwork would have been particularly impressive at such a close range. His wavering line, extreme variations of thick and thin in the brushwork, and willingness to saturate the paper after reloading his brush are all typical of his style, a kind of old-fashioned and casual rusticity."
Pomegranates,"This quickly executed album leaf by Qi Baishi depicts a classic auspicious subject: pomegranates, whose bounty of seeds imply fertility and a wish for many sons. Qi reinforced the message with a seal-script inscription that may be read as either “Many seeds” or “many sons”—the same character may be read as either “seeds” or sons”. This small painting was executed in the long-lived artist’s ninetieth year."
Landscapes_Painted_for_Yuweng,"Fan Qi worked in an unusually precise and realistic style. He was also among those painters most clearly influenced by Western landscape techniques, which were imported to Nanjing through the prints, books, and paintings brought by Jesuit missionaries.In this album Fan's interest in describing the changing seasons, times of day, and differing qualities of light and atmosphere recalls the descriptive goals of Song painting. In contrast to Song landscapes, Fan's minutely described scenery, his accurate use of foreshortening, and his interest in the coloristic effects of sunlight result in an almost documentary quality."
Beautiful_Dream_7,"Painted on flattened cardboard boxes, these images illustrate some of China’s most iconic landscapes: the Great Wall, the ""Welcoming-Guest Pine” on Mount Huang, a Yunnanese pavilion juxtaposed with a bird alighting on a bare tree branch, and Guilin’s spindly karst-formation mountains reflected in the Li River. These clichéd images—virtual “brands” for package tours—are further trivialized by being painted on the quintessential medium for packaging commercial goods. But Duan has carefully crafted these postcard-like landscapes, using the cardboards’ creased, corrugated texture to create a sense of intimacy and understated beauty that transcend the works’ mundane origins in material culture."
"""Splashed-color""_landscape","After 1949 Zhang Daqian lived in Hong Kong and India before building residences in Brazil, California, and Taiwan. His long residency outside China inevitably brought him into contact with modern Western art, including Abstract Expressionism. This work, painted with intense mineral colors and broad washes of layered ink, may represent Zhang's response to these influences.Zhang maintained that such works, which he first made in Europe in 1956, derived from the ""broken-ink"" techniques of random splashing and soaking used by Tang-dynasty (618-906) artists, but it seems more likely that Western abstract art encouraged him to develop the Japanese technique of splashed colors that he had used in earlier works. He welcomed the liberating effect of this painting mode, which gave a spontaneity to his compositions. In spite of their abstract qualities, however, these paintings remain resolutely descriptive of the natural world. Here, Zhang applied ink and color in a seemingly random manner, then added contour lines and other details that transform the composition into a highly suggestive vision of storm—engulfed mountains illuminated by a burst of sunlight that has turned the somber clouds iridescent."
"Shanghai,_China,_15–16_October_2004","This eerie image of contemporary Shanghai was created using a camera obscura, an ancient technology for projecting images that Shi has adopted for his artistic practice. To create a print with this method, light is projected through a small hole onto a sheet of photographic paper for hours while the image is exposed. Because the exposure takes such a long time, the frenetic movement of people and vehicles that animates the city does not register in the resulting print. Instead, we are presented with one of the world’s largest and most dynamic cities rendered as a silent vista—a new landscape for the twenty-first century."
Mandarin_orange,"This simple ink play by Qi Baishi evokes the squat form of a mandarin orange through a few casual flicks of the brush. Much of the rest of the composition is taken up with the artist’s inscription:Greatly Auspicious! Playfully painted by Old Man Jieshan.大吉。借山老人戱。Qi’s inscription confirms the identity of the fruit, as the character for “auspicious” 吉 (ji) is close to the form and sound of the character for mandarin orange 桔 (ju)."
Wrist_rest_decorated_with_landscape,"This wrist rest is a fine example of bamboo carving by Jin Xiya (1890–1979), the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. It showcases Jin’s virtuosic command of traditional bamboo carving. Here, Jin has left the calligraphy and painting in relief, using the “green skin” (liuqing) technique of leaving the smooth outer skin (since turned yellow) to stand forth against the darker ground. His works incorporate compositions from designs contributed by his contemporary artists, such as the landscape after Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322) by Zhou Qiaonian (1873–?), a late Qing-dynasty court painter, on this piece.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (wrist rest #14), the bamboo carving was completed on July 12, 1923."
Folding_fan_with_bamboo_frame_carved_with_spider_and_bamboos,"This folding fan features exquisite carvings on its outer ribs by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. This work showcase Jin’s sophisticated skill in relief carving. This work is also a rare example from a late stage of Jin’s art career.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (fan frame #377), the bamboo carving was completed on June 5, 1960 and took him twelve days."
Portrait_of_a_gentleman_gathering_chrysanthemums,"The poet Tao Yuanming was a source of inspiration to many scholar-officials, who saw his decision to retire from official life as a righteous stand against ambition and blind adherence to society’s expectations. By the seventeenth century, men began to commission portraits of themselves inhabiting Tao’s role by acting out famous scenes from his poetry. This portrait is by Hua Guan, who worked in elite circles in Beijing during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The sitter, as yet unidentified, plucks chrysanthemums, Tao’s favorite flower."
Pensive_Scholar,"A bearded scholar stands in an undefined void with a boy attendant at his side. The scholar looks down, as if lost in reverie. The boy stands at attention, hands covered in his sleeves, waiting for his master’s command. Painted in 1947, in the midst of a decade-long bitter conflict for control of China, this image seems to capture some of the painter’s fatigue with seemingly endless war. The inscription indicates that the painting was made for presentation to a certain Mr. Keping 克平."
Landscapes_of_Taiping_Prefecture,"In 1648, the artist Xiao Yuncong designed a printed book of images that celebrate the mountain scenery of central Anhui Province. The book was commissioned by Zhang Wanxuan, who served as an official in Anhui at the beginning of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Prior to Xiao’s time, famous artists rarely designed prints; the adoption of this medium by Xiao and a few of his contemporaries reflects the porous boundaries between “high” and “low” culture during the seventeenth century. This relatively affordable printed book disseminated the tradition of local scenery paintings—and the stunning vistas of Anhui Province—to a wider audience."
Reading_under_a_Tree_in_Autumn,"Born in Songjiang (near modern Shanghai), Cheng Sui spent most of his life in Yangzhou and Nanjing, but he is associated with the Anhui School through his painting style as well as through ancestral ties and friendships with the school’s major members.Cheng said he only painted in his spare time from seal carving. Departing from the characteristic Anhui School idiom of linear forms rendered with dry brushstrokes and minimal texturing, he animated his compositions with quivering lines and animated ink dots that cause the surfaces of his pictures to vibrate.According to his finely brushed inscription, Cheng painted this landscape for a Mr. Bai’an in Nanjing after recovering from an eye ailment."
Beautiful_Dream_2,"Painted on flattened cardboard boxes, these images illustrate some of China’s most iconic landscapes: the Great Wall, the ""Welcoming-Guest Pine” on Mount Huang, a Yunnanese pavilion juxtaposed with a bird alighting on a bare tree branch, and Guilin’s spindly karst-formation mountains reflected in the Li River. These clichéd images—virtual “brands” for package tours—are further trivialized by being painted on the quintessential medium for packaging commercial goods. But Duan has carefully crafted these postcard-like landscapes, using the cardboards’ creased, corrugated texture to create a sense of intimacy and understated beauty that transcend the works’ mundane origins in material culture."
The_Wave,"In his Wave sculptures, Ai appropriates the motif’s earlier pictorial representation as “cultural ready-mades.” Made with the assistance of craftsmen at Jingdezhen, in Jiangxi Province, China’s center for fine porcelain production, the celadon-glazed body of this piece recalls vessels produced at the Longquan kilns located outside the Southern Song capital of Hangzhou, while its form may have been inspired by a depiction of waves by the Southern Song court painter Ma Yuan (ca. 1160–1225) as well as the famous Japanese woodblock print Under the Wave off Kanagawa (The Great Wave), by Katsushika Hokusai (1760–1849)."
Shrimp_and_Fish,"By the 1930s Qi Baishi was creating his images of fish, fruit and flowers with calligraphic brushwork. Calligraphy teaches a prescribed sequence of individual brush strokes to render an idea as an image. Within the prescribed limits the image takes its life from the vitality and character of the act of writing. The thing signified is in effect, created, not imitated in the character. As Qi began to organize his images according to these calligraphic principles, Shao Shaoyi followed suit. Show Shaoyi's brushwork tends to flourishes uncharacteristic of his master's hand."
Folding_fan_with_bamboo_frame_carved_with_tree_peonies_and_fingered_citrons,"This folding fan features exquisite carvings on its outer ribs by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. This work showcase Jin’s sophisticated skill in relief carving.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (fan frame #369), the bamboo carving was completed on March 23, 1949."
"Bamboo_and_Mantis,_Leaf_from_the_Mustard_Seed_Garden_Painting_Manual,_part_3","Parts 2 and 3 of the Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual were compiled in 1701 by Wang Gai and his brothers (or nephews) Wang Shi and Wang Nie. These visually appealing sections reproduce colorful, animated images of flowers, plants, birds, and insects. Closely imitating real paintings, these prints often combine pictorial imagery with the calligraphy and seals of the artists who made the designs. The precise contours and chromatic variations attest to the superb craftsmanship of the carver and the printer."
Beautiful_Dream_3,"Painted on flattened cardboard boxes, these images illustrate some of China’s most iconic landscapes: the Great Wall, the ""Welcoming-Guest Pine” on Mount Huang, a Yunnanese pavilion juxtaposed with a bird alighting on a bare tree branch, and Guilin’s spindly karst-formation mountains reflected in the Li River.

Untitled,"This minimalist painting along with the two adjacent works come from Qiu’s on-going series in which barely detectable traces of imagined landscapes only reveal themselves incrementally upon sustained observation. Executed in oil—often on unprimed canvas—each image is created through the application of many layers of dilute, semitransparent paint until the underlying landscape details that Qiu has painted in black or colors all but vanish in the overall whiteness of the composition. Never titled, Qiu’s paintings remain purely visual experiences that are evocative of the aesthetic of “serene blandness” ( pingdan), highly prized in the traditional literati canon. Here, one may detect the dimpled slope of a mountain rising steeply from a level foreground."
The_Five_Nobilities,"The artist called this painting The Five Nobilities, a play on the fact that the word for “sparrow” (que 雀) sounds like the word for “noble rank” (jue 爵). According to the artist’s inscription, he copied the composition after a painting attributed to the Song dynasty emperor Huizong (1082–1135)."
Lady_reading_a_scroll,"One aspect of the Dunhuang murals that fascinated Zhang was the application of color, which differed from the traditions in which he had trained. The ancient murals, which featured bright, bold colors, required many layers of pigment to achieve the desired opacity. In his copies of the murals, and in Dunhuang-inspired paintings such as this one, Zhang displayed the knowledge he gained in the desert by applying colors laboriously and in layers, following the ancients."
Poems_for_Jingzhai_Presented_upon_his_Triumphant_Return_from_Pacifying_Taiwan,"This album of calligraphy preserves poems composed for the Manchu bannerman and military official Fukang’an (1748–1796), referred to here by his sobriquet Jingzhai, by Hongwu, an artistically minded imperial clansman and first cousin of the Qianlong emperor. Writing in a fluid hand close in style to that of his cousin Qianlong, Hongwu extols the valor of Fukang’an and his forces in quelling a rebellion against Qing rule that took place from 1787 to 1788 in Taiwan."
Lotus_Studies,"In these drawings, most likely done from life, Xie explores, from various angles, the sensual beauty of the lotus's flowers and leaves. Using firm, precise lines, he records the plant's entire life cycle, from dewy bud to full blossom, as well as its occasionally tattered leaves and blighted petals. His crisp delineation of the stalks demonstrates his solid discipline in calligraphy."
669,"Li’s transition to pure abstraction was abrupt: in 1998, after a long and successful career painting landscapes and figures, Li abandoned representation and began to produce grids like these. Li’s sudden renunciation of narrative content, subject matter, and autographic brushwork, as well as any wish to explain his artistic motivation, bespeaks an independent, even defiant personality in keeping with his career up to that point. Li’s grids are drawn freehand, and to execute such long, straight lines of consistent thickness demands extraordinary brush control and concentration. Li sees this painstaking process as an embodiment of time, like visual records of a meditative state."
Simple_Retreat,"Wang Meng depicted scholars in their retreats, creating imaginary portraits that capture not the physical likeness of a person or place but rather an interior world of shared associations and ideals. He presented the master of Simple Retreat as a gentleman recluse. Seated at the front gate of a rustic hermitage, he is shown holding a magic fungus, as a servant and two deer approach from the woods. In the courtyard, another servant offers a sprig of herbs to a crane. The auspicious Daoist imagery of fungus, crane, and deer as well as the archaic simplicity of the figures and dwelling evokes a dreamlike vision of paradise.In creating this visionary world, Wang transformed the monumental landscape imagery of the tenth-century master Dong Yuan. Rocks and trees, animated with fluttering texture strokes, dots, color washes, and daubs of bright mineral pigment, pulse with a calligraphic energy barely contained within the traditional landscape structure. Encircled by this energized mountainscape, the retreat becomes a reservoir of calm at the vortex of a world whose dynamic configurations embody nature's creative potential but may also suggest the ever-shifting terrain of political power."
Peaches_and_Buddha's_Hand,"The paintings of Qi Baishi's last years, such as this fan, tend to be familiar images rendered with a colorful palette and clear graphic simplicity.This picture, with its auspicious message of ""Good Luck and Long Life"" inscribed in bold seal-script characters, was done as a companion piece to the adjacent Chrysanthemums, datable to 1955."
The_Yellow_Mountains_(Huangshan),"Li Huasheng made this impressionistic image of the Heavenly Capital Peak (Tiandu feng) of the Yellow Mountains (Huangshan) after he visited the site in 1980. Though Li’s sketchbooks from that time indicate that he found Huangshan inspiring, the inscription on this painting reveals his discomfort with the rise of tourism and the economic inequality it brought with it. The poem reads (in part):Thousands of steps climbing to Heaven’s gate.Tourists sit around, suffering from food too rich;In the workers’ mouths: dry biscuit crumbs,Their calloused hands painfully drawing water from the mountain stream,Their dark sleeves sweat-drenched, by their own salt whitened.— Translation after Jerome Silbergeld and Gong Jisui"
Bird_on_a_Rock_by_a_Flowering_Branch,"Ren Xun painted this delicate fan in Suzhou, where he spent a good part of his artistic career before going to Shanghai. This work draws upon the highly representational style of the Southern Song (1127–1279) Imperial Painting Academy, merging exquisite drawing in fine contour lines with meticulously graded colored washes in a highly naturalistic image of great charm. The painting reflects Ren's keen observation of nature: a tiny bird, perched on one foot on an ornamental garden rock, bends its head to meet its uplifted foot, using wings and tail to maintain balance. Compared to his Song academic predecessors, Ren Xun brings his image closer to the viewer, cropping the bird's tail and the tree trunk, giving his picture immediacy and impact."
Studio_by_the_Water,"From 1902 to 1909 Chen Hengke studied in Japan, where he witnessed the indigenous culture being rejected in the pursuit of material advantages from the West. He was determined that China would not follow the same course. After his return from Japan, he taught at colleges in Nantong, Changsha, and Beijing, becoming an influential historian of the literati tradition and a leading painter and calligrapher in Beijing.This work shows the kind of artless simplicity that was at the core of Chen's vision. While he used conventional media and techniques, he avoided overt references to earlier stylistic sources in order to express his own presence. The carefree ease of the scholar looking out from his studio is conveyed simply and directly through Chen's joyful brushwork: the buoyant lines of the pavilion—not one of which is straight—the casual ripples of the water, and the rhythmically repeated pattern of the foliage all communicate a sense of the artist's contentment."
Quatrain_on_Heavenly_Mountain,"In 1162, at the age of fifty-five, Gaozong retired from the throne to devote his final years to the arts, especially the study of calligraphy. He began by following the styles of Huang Tingjian (1045–1105) and Mi Fu (1052–1107) but in his later years concen-trated on the works of Wang Xizhi (ca. 303–ca. 361) and other pre-Tang masters whose works he was able to collect and study firsthand. This fan clearly dates after 1162; written in the Wang style, it bears a seal with the name of Gaozong's retirement palace, Virtuous Longevity.The poem, laden with occult and astrological references, reads in part:Dark [. . .] from Heavenly Mountain divides the turbid and the vast.Ministered by the second hexagram, the elixir pours in a liquid jade.As I stand at the north-northeast and the south-southwest gates of the compass,I see the flash of rosy lights, ten thousand feet in the air."
Viewing_Antiquities_at_the_Studio_of_Humility,"When he was in his sixties, Qi Baishi applied calligraphic brushwork to other genres of painting, particularly landscape. Viewing Antiquities at the Studio of Humility effortlessly incorporates an archaic color scheme and landscape forms into an image of deceptive simplicity. The painting depicts a solitary gentleman in his study, arms folded on the table, contemplating a tray of objects. The scholar appears at home in a world of blue and red hills and schematic trees, motifs that convey Qi's knowledge of sixth-century murals at the Buddhist cave temples at Dunhuang but that are incorporated in an unpedantic manner in harmony with his folklike vision."
Buddha_of_Longevity,"The son of the noted figure painter Ren Xiong (1820–1857), Ren Yu was only a few years old when his father died; his uncle Ren Xun (1835–1893) taught him to paint.Ren's inscription states that this painting is modeled after a work by the Yangzhou ""eccentric"" Jin Nong (1687–1764). Like Jin, Ren has done nothing to make his figure visually ingratiating. Freely combining attributes of the meditating Chan (Zen) Buddhist patriarch Bodhidharma with the bulbous-headed Daoist God of Longevity, Ren's craggy figure radiates the austere air of an otherworldly saint."
Angling_in_the_Autumn_River,"Both this painting and Recluse Fisherman, Autumn Trees by Sheng Zhu's uncle Sheng Mou are executed in a brush idiom that recalls the Five Dynasties tradition of Dong Yuan (active 930s-960s) and Juran (active ca. 960-95), in which ""hemp-fiber"" texture strokes were applied in round parallel brushstrokes and plump ""moss dots"" were used to model the rocks. An insistent kinesthetic energy in Sheng Mou's brushwork relates it to that of Wu Zhen (1280-1354); the nephew's more casual style of painting introduces a new, relaxed feeling into the landscape and figural elements."
Willow,"The softly brushed impressionistic style that appeared in the third quarter of the 19th century in works by such Shanghai painters as Xu Gu and the Four Rens, continues in the next generation."
Wintry_plum,"Plum blossoms were first depicted as an independent subject by the eleventh-century Chan (Zen, in Japanese) monk Zhongren Huaguang. In this work by the otherwise unknown Buddhist monk Ni Jing, both composition and brushwork derive from the renowned Yuan-dynasty plum painter Wang Mian (d. 1359). The plum, the first flower to appear in spring, is celebrated along with bamboo and pine as one of the Three Friends of Winter. Admired for its purity and hardiness, sending forth new shoots and delicate blossoms from seemingly lifeless branches, the plum became a symbol of survival, rejuvenation, and longevity. Here, the tight clusters of pale blossoms and buds indicate that the plum has just begun to flower. The artist’s poem reads:Blossoms compete with the moon in luminosity,One hundred of them merge and make me suspect thatsnow has fragrance.Worldly men vie in boasting fine colors,Do not call for hand-scooped water to rinse off the pinkadornment."
Landscapes_after_old_masters,"This album demonstrates Dong Qichang's interpretation of the entire spectrum of Song and Yuan styles using a set of contrasting brushstroke methods, which could also be used for depicting actual landscapes. The great theorist and painter took as his point of departure the works of the Yuan master Ni Zan (1306–1374), whose paintings were regarded as calligraphic abstractions of earlier Song styles. In the first two leaves, Dong contrasts—in what he regards as the early and late styles of Ni Zan's art—an ""earthen"" landscape (round, parallel, ""hemp-fiber"" brushstrokes) with a ""rocky"" one (angular, oblique, ""folded-ribbon"" brushstrokes). In successive leaves, Dong juxtaposes various ""earthen"" and ""rocky"" themes in order to evoke different paradigmatic styles of the Northern Song period."
Landscape,"After passing the palace examination with high honors in 1607, Zhang Ruitu held a number of important government posts before being elevated to the grand secretariat in 1626 through the support of the powerful eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568–1627). Zhang, a renowned calligrapher, won favor with Wei by writing out texts composed in the eunuch's honor. Although Zhang retired from office in 1628, shortly after Wei's downfall (and decapitation), he was later listed as one of the eunuch's followers and escaped imprisonment only by paying a large fine. He spent his last years in his native Fujian, and most of his paintings date to that period. Renouncing Dong Qichang's (1555–1636) emphasis on dynamic brushwork and calligraphic abstraction, Zhang developed his own lyrical interpretation of the Northern Song monumental landscape style. His Song sources are apparent here in the use of satin rather than paper, the elongated vertical format, the dense buildup of texture strokes, and the tripartite separation of foreground, middle ground, and distant elements. Zhang's poetic couplet is inscribed in his powerful regular script:A boat moves from the city wall into the trees;The riverbanks are far apart and the water reflects the sky."
Landscape_with_great_pine,"The reductionist transformation from Northern Song monumental landscapes to symbolic images of single rocks and trees is complete with the work of Ma Lin. Ma's painting turns away from the realism of earlier Song Imperial Painting Academy works in favor of a new abstraction. In the absence of an accompanying poem, the meaning of this complex scene remains unclear. The Daoist-inspired imagery seems to hold out the promise of transcendence or escape. Outdoor altars are places of worship and meditation, cranes are known as the vehicles and companions of Daoist immortals, the evergreen pine is an emblem of longevity, and the full moon recalls the palace of the moon goddess, Chang E, whose hare prepares the elixir of immortality. Yet the immortals have not come, and the moon is far away. The figure is anchored to this world and can no more reach the moon than can the outstretched branches of the pine. There is a sense of brooding and foreboding in the tortuous, restless form of the tree that may well be influenced by the impending threat of Mongol invasion."
Poem,"明 文徴明 行書自書詩 卷 紙本Wen Zhengming created this masterpiece of monumental calligraphy at the age of eighty-four. The writing begins with precisely articulated brushstrokes of standard script but loosens gradually into a more spontaneous semicursive. This shift in style mirrors the content of the poem itself, which begins with scenic imagery and ends with a melancholy reflection on old age and the loss of close friends.The poem on this handscroll is translated below:Pushing their way through the gate, mountain ridges,all blue-green and craggy;A side path pierces the cloudsas you climb step by step.Green tiles in orderly profusion—lotus-world serene;Ancient vines deeply penetrating—purple cliffs crumbling away.All that passes my eyes just leads to sorrow:ephemeral realm of dust!The sphere of transcendence, kept at a distance—I’ve betrayed my monastic vocation!Of those who wandered with us ten years ago,half have passed away.There is only one thing forever shining:the votive lamp before Buddha.—Trans. by Jonathan Chaves"
Mahasthamaprapta_Bodhisattva,"About 1900 the French Sinologist Paul Pelliot acquired a large group of paintings in Beijing that had come from a Qing imperial repository. Included in that group was a partial set of paintings that were created for the Water-Land ritual, a Buddhist mortuary ceremony conducted for the salvation of all the souls of the dead, whether on land or at sea. This painting may have come from the same set.A cartouche in the upper right corner of the composition identifies the deity portrayed here as Mahasthamaprapta (Dashizhi, in Chinese), a bodhisattva or enlightened being whose name means ""one who has attained great power."" Seated on a strikingly realistic lion mount and accompanied by a female attendant bearing a pearl, the bodhisattva holds the stem of a lotus with two blossoms that appear above his shoulders, one supporting a pearl, the other a thunderbolt-like implement (vajra). His right hand forms the mudra for charity. Most likely, this painting would have been displayed as part of a triptych together with an image of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin) and a central image of the Amitabha (Miluo) Buddha."
Wrist_rest_decorated_with_long_beans,"This wrist rest is an excellent example of bamboo carving by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. It showcases Jin’s virtuosic command of traditional bamboo carving. His works incorporate compositions from designs contributed by important modern artists, such as Jin Cheng (1878–1926) on this piece. Jin’s works not only represent the highest achievement of bamboo carving in early twentieth century China, but they also preserve a microcosm of the literati world of that time, when members of the scholarly elite sought to sustain inherited traditions in the face of a rapidly modernizing world.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (wrist rest #29), the bamboo carving was completed on February 17, 1925."
Wrist_rest_decorated_with_an_ear_of_corn_and_ladybug,"This wrist rest is an excellent example of bamboo carving by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. It showcases Jin’s virtuosic command of traditional bamboo carving as well as his creative experimentation. The artist has not only meticulously conveyed the varied textures of the stalk, leaves, and kernels, but by varying the density of striations between the broad lines of a leaf and the denser lines of the sheaf around the ear of corn, he has also conveyed a sense of overlapping forms. He has further enlivened his compositions by adding insects—a ladybug on the tassel of one ear of corn. Although it is based on a design contributed by the artist’s brother Jin Cheng (1876–1926), as indicated in the inscriptions, the decision to adopt such an unusual subject and its perfect translation onto bamboo are clear reflections of Jin Xiya’s creative personality.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (wrist rest #26), the bamboo carving was completed on December 16, 1924."
Listening_to_the_Zither_Among_Streams_and_Pines,"Xie Shichen was a versatile artist whose paintings share features of both the Zhe School professionals and the Suzhou scholar-artists. Xie's ""hemp-fiber"" texture strokes and dark foliage dots derive from the eminent Suzhou amateur Shen Zhou (1427–1509), but his monumental composition, narrative subject matter, and bold brushwork owe more to the Nanjing professional Wu Wei (1459–1508). In this painting, a pair of scholars on a spring outing have paused to admire a blossoming plum tree that grows beneath the sheltering branches of an ancient pine. The nearby mountain torrent flows out of a deep valley where dense white clouds obscure the lower halves of precipitous peaks, including the towering central monolith whose position along the painting's vertical axis serves as an anchor to the entire composition. To the left of the peak, Xie inscribed a seven-character quatrain along with his signature."
Wrist_rest_decorated_with_gourds,"This wrist rest is an excellent example of bamboo carving by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. It perfectly demonstrates Jin’s command of intaglio carving at an early stage in his career. The décor, following a design contributed by his brother Jin Cheng (1876–1926), is engraved into the bamboo’s curved surface in fine “iron wire” lines that nonetheless capture the twisting and turning of the foliage. The outlines of the gourds were emphasized with broader, beveled intaglio lines that give the gourds a more three-dimensional appearance. The incised inscription also conveys the varied modulations of Jin Cheng’s calligraphy.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (wrist rest #9), the bamboo carving was completed on September 6, 1922."
"Wrist_rest_decorated_with_geese,_sparrows,_bamboo,_and_rock","This wrist rest is an excellent example of bamboo carving by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. Here, Jin demonstrates his proficiency by combining several carving styles in a single work. The birds and bamboo stand forth in high “green skin” relief, while the garden rock with dots of moss appears in low relief against a ground of vertical striations suggestive of the bamboo’s grain. Similarly, the geese stand on a pathway of smooth paving stones that leads to a wicker gate. A final tour de force of carving is the way the layered feathers and webbed feet of the geese are rendered. One goose’s beak is open with its tongue sticking up as if it were honking loudly—further animating this remarkable scene.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (wrist rest #53), this wrist rest took him forty-two days to complete on January 31, 1945."
Yangzi_River_Gorge,"In tones of smoky blue and light sienna, Fu Baoshi presents the precipitous drama of the Yangzi River gorges as a wall of rock engulfing a small triangle of river. Boats diminish in scale as they sail downriver on choppy waves that are rendered in quick, swiping strokes of dilute ink against the white ground. On the sheer fliff faces, hints of trees and rocky textures are suggested by swirls and swipes of ink mixed with broad washes. Fu Baoshi painted this dark, brooding depiction of a majestic Yangzi River Gorge in 1947, after returning from Sichuan to his native Nanjing."
"[Group_Portrait_near_Fangguangyan_Monastery,_Fujian]","Around 1869, Lai Fong was invited by foreign residents of Fuzhou to record a private excursion by boat to the Fangguangyan Monastery, a “hanging temple” known for its spectacular location and design. Lai posed the group for photographs at several spots along the route.The rather illustrious expedition party included Charles Sinclair, the British Consult of Fuzhou, who sits on the stool at left; Sinclair’s wife, who leans against the rock wall; Baron de Me?ritens, an Imperial Maritime Customs Service commissioner, who perches on a rock at center; Prosper Giquel, Director of the Fuzhou Arsenal, who stands by Sinclair’s wife; and Francis Temple, an accountant at the Shanghai branch of the Oriental Bank, who is stretched out informally in the foreground. The man adopting a similar pose in the background remains unidentified.[Yuhua Ding and Kate Addleman-Frankel]"
Cinnabar_Chamber_Deep_in_the_Mountains,"Hongren was the most important and original of the Anhui School artists. A filial son, he may have joined the resistance movement against the Manchu invaders before renouncing all worldly ties by becoming a Buddhist monk. His landscape painting, inspired by the spare linear style of the recluse-artist Ni Zan (1306–1374) and by the chiseled topography of Anhui’s Yellow Mountain, made him a leading individualist artist of the time.This large scroll superbly embodies Hongren’s synthetic approach to painting. The central rock mass evokes eleventh-century monumental landscapes; the modular geometric structure of the central bluff and dry crumbly brushwork recall fourteenth-century masters’ formal experiments; and the arbitrary manipulation of scale reflects the late Ming disregard of naturalism.Hongren painted this work as a birthday present for a friend. In his inscription he wishes the recipient longevity and refers to the main structure in the painting as the cinnabar chamber where the elixir of immortality was produced.cat. no. 40"
Reminiscence_of_Jinling,"Wang Gai was a gifted stylist who worked in the vibrant city of Nanjing in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Wang’s ability to paint in a range of manners led to his selection as the illustrator of the Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting, a primer on painting that introduced techniques and historical styles to those without access to original works of art."
"Divine_Light_Series_No._59,_The_Floating_Incomplete_Circle","A leading figure of “experimental ink” since the 1990s, Zhang has sought to bridge disparate artistic traditions across time and culture through mining the potential of the ink medium in nonfigurative work. In this monumental piece from Zhang’s Divine Light series, a giant circle surrounded by a radiant halo is suspended in a dark “sky” spangled with starlike dots of uninked paper. In the darkness above the sphere, the artist has impressed a single small seal that reads “Shiyu bi” (Brush of Shiyu)—Shiyu, or “stone rain,” being Zhang’s sobriquet. Dwarfed by the scale of the sphere, the red seal nonetheless declares man’s presence within this vast firmament, an allusion to the artist as creator."
Song_of_the_Lute,"On a chilly autumn evening in 816 CE, the poet Bai Juyi was seeing a friend off at a ferry stop when he heard the sound of a lute drifting across the water. Following the music, he came to a boat from which an aging courtesan issued her mournful song across the darkening river. Moved by the melancholy dignity of the scene, Bai wrote “Song of the Lute” in honor of the courtesan. In this rendering of the famous poem, the only indication of night is the candle between Bai and his friend as they sit in their boat, transfixed by the beauty of the music."
"100_Layers_of_Ink,_No.1","For a decade between 1989 and 1999, Yang worked on the series 100 Layers of Ink, to which this work (one from a set of three) belongs. It is the result of focused repetition: Yang applied ink to the same pieces of paper, day after day, until the paper was completely saturated. As the paper reaches saturation, the ink takes on a shimmery, luminescent quality, and the paper itself shifts from a two-dimensional surface to a three-dimensional object, merging figure and ground, coming close to sculpture. Though these are the same materials used by literati to make traditional paintings, Yang has reinvented them here, removing entirely the artist’s gesture as an index of meaning."
View_of_Tide,"This composite photograph takes the form of a panoramic handscroll that presents a succession of towering mountains wreathed in mist and surrounded by expanses of open water. But upon closer examination, the majestic mountains are revealed to be composed of countless high-rise apartments and other buildings, while the “trees” are actually power-line towers and construction cranes—the ubiquitous icons of New China. What initially appears to be a pristine image of nature’s grandeur is suddenly exposed as an entirely man-made environment, except for the watery passages comprising images of actual waves and waterfalls. Created through Yang’s distinctive method of “painting” with digital photography, the seemingly harmonious traditional landscape becomes a subtle yet critical response to urbanization."
Being_Open_and_Empty,"A prominent example of Wang’s monumental calligraphic abstraction, this hanging scroll features powerfully inked lines that convey a vivid sense of the artist’s physical engagement with the work. The interaction of ink and ground—especially the spatters and streaks that communicate the impact and momentum of the brush—is crucial to its appreciation. The white paper is not simply the absence of ink, it is the picture “space” into which Wang’s ink structure is thrust. The title, borrowed from a phrase in the Daoist classic Zhuangzi (ca. 300 B.C.), refers to a state of enlightenment achieved through ridding one’s mind of mundane trifles. Its literal meaning, however, “protect the white” (shou bai), may also reflect Wang’s awareness of the uninked paper as a significant component of the whole."
Mountain_Scenery_with_Streams_and_Pavilions_in_the_Style_of_Fan_Kuan,"Wang Jian studied with the influential painter-theorist Dong Qichang. Under his guidance, Wang embarked on an intensive study of old master styles, eventually incorporating a broad view of painting history into his own personal style. In this work, Wang explores the manner of the great eleventh-century artist Fan Kuan, adopting the earlier master’s jagged contour lines and signature “raindrop” texture stroke to add a tactile quality to the rocky cliffs."
Mythos_of_Lost_Dynasties_Series—I_Evaluate_Characters_Written_by_Three_Men_and_Three_Women,"In this important early experimental work, Gu problematizes the written word by inviting six of his students at the Zhejiang Academy (where he taught from 1981 to 1987) to each write on a sheet of paper a large-scale variation of the character “quiet” (jing 静). No two characters are written the same way: some resemble early seal script, while others are deliberately miswritten. Gu then added spatters of ink to the characters before using red pigment either to cross out the characters with an “X” or to indicate approval with a circle. Such marks were a traditional way for teachers to indicate whether a character had been written correctly, but they also were a powerful reminder of the Cultural Revolution when, in Gu’s words, “You cross out the bad person, and leave the good person.” Here, Gu has kept his evaluation standards ambiguous, calling into question the validity of any cultural or political value system."
Ink_Handscroll,"Liu began working on this imposing painting shortly after the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square were crushed by military intervention in 1989; it took more than a year to complete. Liu is said to have been inspired by the form of a flickering candle flame, which may be why he chose to begin the scroll with roiling jets of cinnabar pigment and plumes of white. As the scroll unfurls, the red dissipates into grays and blacks, while the white areas morph into shapes suggestive of clouds, watercourses, jagged ice outcrops, or crystalline inclusions but, almost never, patches of sky. This uninhabitable landscape shows no sign of human presence. It is modeled in lines of uniform thickness created by a centered brush tip (zhongfeng)—a method derived from calligraphy. While the hatch marks recall Western methods of shading, there is no consistent light source. Instead, the shifting tonalities represent a rhythmic interplay of positive and negative patterns that defy any logical reading of mass or space."
"100_Layers_of_Ink,_No.2","For a decade between 1989 and 1999, Yang worked on the series 100 Layers of Ink, to which this work (one from a set of three) belongs. It is the result of focused repetition: Yang applied ink to the same pieces of paper, day after day, until the paper was completely saturated.

Urban_Fiction_No._13,"With Urban Fiction, a series beginning in 2004, Xing explores the form and psyche of contemporary living in modern high-rise “palaces of the people.” In these large-scale color photographs of real-estate developers’ architectural models, Xing has digitally inserted tiny cutout figures to enact a variety of imaginary human dramas. While these figures form only a tiny part of each image, their actions—often carried out by the artist herself—become the focal point of an otherwise sterile environment. Whatever action we are voyeuristically invited to witness is placed within a fictional setting in which there is no other trace of genuine human activity. Xing implies that the dream of luxury, modernity, and a better life that these maquettes are intended to convey may sometimes induce isolation and loneliness."
Transcription_of_Three_of_Cao_Tang’s_“Smaller_Wandering_Immortal_Poems”,"Da Chongguang was among a group of late seventeenth-century calligraphers who excelled at the performative art of large-scale calligraphy in the hanging scroll format. Such calligraphy was often written in group settings that encouraged panache in both performance and calligraphic form. Here, Da Chongguang transcribes three ancient poems in thick, dark ink on a large piece of satin, using strategic imbalances and variant forms of characters to add individual flair to his performance."
Cloudy_mountains,"Fa Ruozhen is known for his fantastical mountainscapes permeated with clouds. This imposing landscape, painted in 1684 when the artist was seventy-two years old and still in his prime, is an exceptionally well-realized composition by this important scholar-artist of the early Qing dynasty. While most of Fa's paintings are on paper, this work is executed on silk, which suggests that it was intended for an important recipient.Like a great cumulonimbus cloud, the landscape billows upward in roiling layers of earth punctuated by misty vales harboring half-concealed groves of trees. The composition is conceived in the classic ""three distances"" manner, with foreground trees and piled-up boulders giving way to a ridge line in the middle ground that is in turn overshadowed by distant rugged peaks. But Fa flattened forms and compressed distances to maximize the verticality of his restless landscape. Aided by the stream that meanders through the mountains, the judiciously placed passages of mist and cloud sustain the illusion of separation between the three distances, giving depth and mass to the agitated outcrops."
Copy_of_Zhang_Xu's_Cursive_Calligraphy_of_Four_Ancient_Poems,"In 1969 and 1970, Xie borrowed Zhang Xu's (act. ca. 700–750) calligraphic masterpiece, a transcription in wild cursive script of poems by Yu Xin (513–581) and Xie Lingyun (385–433). Xie's traced copy reproduces,in exquisite detail, not only Zhang's dynamic, spontaneous brushstrokes but also the collectors' seals of both the emperor Huizong (r. 1101–25) and Zhao Mengjian (1199–before 1267). In addition, at the beginning and end of the album, Xie transcribed two of his own poems and one by Du Fu (712–770), all three on the subject of Zhang's calligraphy. Zhang's original is now in the Liaoning Provincial Museum."
"Crane,_pine,_and_rock","Chen Zhaofeng painted for the court at the end of the nineteenth century, during the twilight of China’s imperial period. Although very little of his art survives, this example reveals a high level of technical accomplishment. The crane, pine, and rock are all symbols of longevity, making this painting appropriate to hang in a palace during a celebratory occasion such as an imperial birthday. Chen’s style follows that of the eighteenth-century court painter Shen Quan (1682–after 1762). Originally composed as a set of four hanging scrolls, this painting was remounted in Japan into its current screen format."
Landscape_after_Hua_Yan,"A landscape of writhing, fantastic forms spreads across this small handscroll in muted tones of dilute ink and ochre. A mountain gate, visible in red at the summit of a pass, punctuates a hillside. A grove of wavy trees defines the foreground. Here and there, pilgrims move through the mountains. As the scroll unfurls, the landscape fades into nothingness, a void over which the artist has added a lengthy inscription.This painting is a nineteenth century interpretation by Liu Yanchong of an earlier work by the artist Hua Yan (1682–1756). Liu inscribed the painting twice, placing his own signature at the right (opening) edge, in which he identifies the painting as a copy of Hua Yan’s original, and copying Hua’s original inscription (dated 1729) and signature along the left (closing) edge of the painting."
Spring_Breeze_of_Myriad_Pasts,"Zhang You, a native of Fengyang, Anhui Province, who inherited the hereditary rank of marquis (hou), was known for his lofty ambition and scholarly demeanor. An aficionado of ornamental plants and rocks, he made a specialty of painting plum blossoms, studying with the Hangzhou master Wang Qian (active first half of the 15th century). According to his inscription, Zhang painted this work for a regional military commander in Pingjiang (Suzhou), Jiangsu Province."
Three_Visits_to_the_Thatched_Hut_of_Zhuge_Liange,"In the chaos of the Han dynasty’s demise in the early third century, rival groups vied to establish control over the empire. Liu Bei (161–223), founder of the state of Shu Han, was one figure who wished to become emperor. Seeking counsel, Liu visited the hut of the wise thinker and strategist Zhuge Liang, but Zhuge wished to remain in seclusion and refused to see him. Only after Liu humbled himself and visited three times did the sage agree to meet; this painting depicts the final visit. Liu’s horses wait at the outer gate as he and his ministers arrive at the inner residence. Zhuge, unimpressed, sleeps on the couch, his back turned to the viewer."
Fisherman_viewing_the_moon,"By the banks of a river, two men in moored fishing boats gaze at the moon. Their rumpled robes and unkempt hair indicate their separation from the ambitions of public service, just as their rapt focus on the moon suggests their connection to nature. Of the few surviving paintings from the hand of the late-Ming painter Ye Guang, most are romantic images of fishermen, so it is likely that he specialized in the genre."
The_Progress_of_Village_Wen,"The scroll depicts the forced migration of villagers from their rural homes to the city due to a governmental land policy in contemporary China. At once literal and symbolic, the composition evolves from mundane drudgery to hallucinatory chaos, suggesting that mental disintegration follows the physical dislocation. The title of the painting has an air of irony.As the people leave their ancestral land, village ghosts move alongside the living. The ominous supernatural imagery foreshadows what awaits the villagers in the city. In adapting to urban life, many of them lose their sense of identity and purpose, which was rooted in an agrarian community. The collapsing scaffolding at the end reflects both an inner and an outer reality."
Landscape_Painted_on_the_Double_Ninth_Festival,"Shitao painted this landscape for a young friend who visited him on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month—a festival traditionally celebrated by mountain climbing. Suddenly struck by his own old age, Shitao wrote this inscription:The days when I go climbing are few now and my walking staff no longer helps me. . . . When you were young, I was already in my prime; but suddenly, you are a man and I am old. The passage of time plays tricks on people; like mist or the moon, it cannot be trusted. The future is like a cloud or traces of decaying grass—how can one fathom it?(trans. Wen Feng)Shitao's painting is like a fleeting vision glimpsed through fog. As the fog lifts, an approaching skiff heralds the arrival of Shitao's friend, whose coming has the effect of clearing weather on the spirits of the housebound artist. Filling the sky above, Shitao's dedicatory poem is written in a buoyantly rhythmic version of ""clerical"" script. The monumental characters, engraved on stelae or cliff faces, boldly defy the transient imagery of the landscape and bespeak Shitao's determination to achieve permanence through his art."
Inn_and_Travelers_in_Snowy_Mountains,"This painting, with its extravagant depiction of the rigors of traveling in the mountains in winter, would have appealed to the merchants from the northern province of Shanxi. Inspired by fantastic garden rockeries rather than an actual landscape, Yuan Yao’s fanciful composition juxtaposes a twisting vertical mountainscape with a level vista where a playful zigzag bridge bisects the view. A distant range of precipitous peaks is straddled by a bridge ornamented with a pavilion—a typical garden conceit in the level terrain of south China—that is incongruously suspended over a deep chasm. In the foreground, a bustling country inn promises a welcome rest stop for travelers.Yuan first laid out this monochrome masterpiece with pale outlines then added broader, boldly brushed contours in varying ink tones that both model forms and enliven them with graphic energy. The result is a dynamic composition that appears to have been executed with great spontaneity—belying the care with which each motif was planned and rendered. Yuan’s craftsmanship is most apparent in his handling of ink washes that leave the snow-covered surfaces in reserve."
Woman_lost_in_thought_beneath_a_wutong_tree,"Images of women in garden settings were popular during the nineteenth century. Sha Fu, a professional painter from Shanghai, was one of the most prolific and sensitive practitioners of the genre. Here, he uses multiple brush modes—broad, chunky lines and washes for the tree, sharp, fine lines for the robe, and meticulous strokes for the face—to depict a woman leaning wistfully on a stone balustrade, bamboo flute in hand. The small circle of reserved paper in the sky indicates that this is a night scene lit by the moon."
A_Temple_Stele_for_Zhou_the_Daoist_of_the_Song_Dynasty,"A native of Suzhou, Wu Dacheng passed the metropolitan civil-service examination in 1868 and subsequently served in a number of high government positions, including scholar in the Hanlin Academy, governor of Guangdong and Hunan Provinces, and director of border defense in the northeast. Wu avidly collected ancient bronzes, jades, and seals, and his interest in antiquities was partly inspired by his study of ancient scripts. Here, Wu has copied a large stone stele into the portable format of the album, in emulation of albums which achieved the same effect by cutting up large rubbings and remounting them."
Zhou_Dunyi_admiring_lotus_flowers,"The melancholy figure in this painting is Zhou Dunyi, a major philosophical thinker of the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127). Late in life, Zhou retired to a rustic retreat at the foot of Mount Lu in Jiangxi Province, where he penned his famous “On the Love of the Lotus,” an ode to his favorite flower. Some images of Zhou depict him as peaceful and carefree, but Ren Xun’s painting, in which the decaying blossoms and leaves of late summer mirror the careworn features of the aging scholar, presents a more brooding vision."
Poem_on_growing_old,"The poem on this fan reads:Regretfully, the work you gave me comes too late,For no old tree can gain its youth again.Alchemic mercury, crucible burned, has the science of long life,Yet, in the mirror, my white hair already looks its age.Features I’ve had all along, forget me now;In the end, to whom belongs the passing of time?Just as no one sees the lashes before his eyes,So do men renowned in later times lean on those who have gone before.—Translation by Marc F. Wilson and Kwan S. Song"
Palaces_of_the_Immortals,"Xu Yang was recruited as a court painter in 1751 and became one of the Qianlong Emperor’s leading artists, culminating with his being selected in 1764 to execute the Qianlong Southern Inspection Tour. This intimate fan painting shows Xu working in a miniaturist style and a decorative blue-and-green technique that differs markedly from his typically grand imperial commissions. According to the artist’s long inscription, Xu was commanded by the emperor to paint this work as a birthday gift to a Mr. Li.Fanciful images of Daoist paradises were suitably auspicious subjects for birthday gifts. Using the archaic blue-and-green landscape style, Xu demonstrates his mastery of this mode with dense mineral colors accented with gold highlights and detailed renderings of architectural forms."
Fragrant_Mountains,"The round, weighty brush strokes borrowed from the study of archaic scripts by late 19th century scholar artists are clearly seen in this fine ink landscape by Wu Dacheng.As a Qing official, Wu Dacheng was a participant in several important events in 19th century history. When the Qing intervened in Annam in 1884 on behalf of the king against the French, Wu was sent to Tientsin to defend the city against the French attack. As governor of Guangdong, he negotiated customs duties on opium that continued to flow into the country through Canton and Macao, and without success recommended against ceding Macao to the Portuguese. As governor of Henan, he raised the standards of production in the lucrative silk and tea industries. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1894, Wu took troops to defend a strategic northern mountain pass. His troops were defeated and he was dismissed from his post, after which he devoted his leisure to cultivating his talents as poet, calligrapher, seal cutter, connoisseur, collector, epigrapher and painter."
Crows_in_Old_Trees,"This painting, by the southern artist Luo Zhichuan, demonstrates the renewed interest in the brush idioms of the Northern Song artists Li Cheng (919–967) and Guo Xi (ca. 1000–ca. 1090) that grew after the Mongol conquest forcefully reunified north and south China in 1279. Luo’s painting may be read as a bleak commentary on life under the Mongols, for the image of a wintry grove of trees has long been understood as a metaphor for like-minded men enduring political adversity. Similarly, the two male pheasants on the shore in the foreground symbolize scholars living in reclusion, while the varied pattern (wen) of their plumage is a symbol of literary cultivation (also wen). Luo contrasts their stoic endurance with the agitated movement of dozens of circling crows—a reference to petty opportunists."
Landscapes_and_poems,"Miffed that his tutor ranked him below his cousin because of inferior calligraphy, Dong Qichang at the age of sixteen dedicated himself to a study of the great calligraphers of the past. By the end of the century, he had become the most influential calligrapher of his age. Although Dong championed the aesthetic of monochromatic ink styles, he indulged in decorative effects in this album, using gold flecked paper with occasional mineral colors for the paintings and choosing a satin ground for his sleek cursive script. Each of the eight leaves, except number seven, is an homage to a past master paired with excerpts from Tang-dynasty landscape poetry. Despite the broad range of styles Dong imitated, the landscapes are remarkably similar to one another and reflect Dong's own intellectual approach to painting most of all."
The_Yellow_Pavilion,"Xia Yong carried the specialty of architectural renderings in the ""ruled-line"" (jiehua) manner to new heights of technical control. In contrast to his loosely described landscape elements, Xia's buildings are densely detailed and meticulously drawn. This predeliction for minute scale is also evident in the artist's microscopic inscription, which transcribes ""A Rhapsody on the Yellow Pavilion,"" an essay by the famous Northern Song scholar Su Che (1039–1112), the younger brother of the poet Su Shi (1037–1101).Su Che's inscription describes how the region around Xuzhou, in northern Jiangsu, was flooded in 1077, following a sudden break in the dikes of the Yellow River. Su Shi, then a prefect there, worked indefatigably to rescue the city from disaster. After the flood subsided and the city walls were repaired, the Yellow Pavilion was dedicated in his honor. Three centuries later, in 1344, the Yellow River flooded again, causing widespread destruction. By referring to a flood that occurred three centuries earlier—and concealing his real message by writing Su's text in a script so minute that few would actually have read it—Xia Yong obliquely signaled his awareness of the momentous social changes caused by the flood, which would lead to the downfall of the Yuan dynasty less than twenty years later."
Cloudy_Mountains,"Fang Congyi, a Daoist priest from Jiangxi, traveled extensively in the north before settling down at the seat of the Orthodox Unity Daoist church, the Shangqing Temple on Mount Longhu (Dragon Tiger Mountain), Jiangxi province. Imbued with Daoist mysticism, he painted landscapes that ""turned the shapeless into shapes and returned things that have shapes to the shapeless.""According to Daoist geomantic beliefs, a powerful life energy pulsates through mountain ranges and watercourses in patterns known as longmo (dragon veins). In Cloudy Mountains, the painter's kinetic brushwork, wound up as if in a whirlwind, charges the mountains with an expressive liveliness that defies their physical structure. The great mountain range, weightless and dematerialized, resembles a dragon ascending into the clouds."
Couplet_on_Water_and_Flowers,"In this work, Feng Kanghou transcribes a couplet from Hong Yingming's (fl. 1596) Thoughts on Vegetable Roots together with Hong's short commentary on the ideas expressed in his verse:However rapidly water flows, it is always tranquil in itself.Though their petals fall from time to time, flowers remain restful at heart.If we could deal with daily affairs and people with this attitude, there would be no inner disturbances.How carefree our bodies and minds would be!(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)Water and flowers remain serene though they are constantly busy flowing or shedding. They embody an attitude that transcends the bustle of daily activities by fulfilling their respective roles in life without psychological resistance. Hong clearly saw in this imagerya key to maintaining peace of mind while living in a clamorous society.Feng here freely mixes a surprising combination of the standard, clerical, and seal script characteristics. This unusual mix of script types demands a patient perusal of each character, thereby slowing down the reading of the text so that the viewer may fully savorthe wisdom embedded in its mundane imagery and unadorned language."
Shaded_Dwellings_among_Streams_and_Mountains,"Dong Qichang, the foremost landscape painter and theorist of the early seventeenth century, pursued artistic reform. Reacting against what he perceived as the decadent, perverse trends of contemporary landscape painting, Dong, following in the literati tradition, sought a creative reconstruction of the past through the critical study of ancient styles. In an attempt to restore simplicity and vitality to painting, Dong advocated a spiritual correspondence with the art of the old masters rather than a literal imitation of them and underscored the importance of self-expression. Approaching painting as though it were calligraphy, Dong alternated positive and negative patterns in his landscapes, which resulted in a radical new kinesthetic style.Shaded Dwellings among Streams and Mountains, based on a work by the early master Dong Yuan (act. 930s–60s), is a complex calligraphic study of rock and tree forms conceived as an integration of abstract, cubic, and dynamically expressive masses that embody and are unified by the kinetic energy of the artist's physical movements."
Couplet_from_a_Poem_by_Han_Hong,"The confidence and boldness displayed by the large characters of this fan epitomize Lizong's late style. Written when the emperor was fifty-six years old, the fan is his latest extant dated work.The couplet, from a poem entitled ""Farewell to Yuan Shen on His Return to Jiangdong"" by Han Hong (act. ca. 766-80), a well-known Tang dynasty poet, brings to mind the scenery around the Southern Song capital:The sounds of the tide rise at noon;The greens of the mountains are deepest in the south."
Li_Bai_gazing_at_the_waterfall_on_Mount_Lu,"Nearly three hundred years after the death of the Song academician Ma Yuan (act. ca. 1190–1225), a Ming emperor proudly declared Zhong Li to be Ma Yuan reborn. Indeed, Zhong's works, painted in a typically bold, breezy, almost contemptuous manner, represent the end of the Ma Yuan tradition. Brought to this level of large-scale power, directness, and nearly total absence of subtlety or nuance, the tradition of Ma Yuan perhaps could not evolve further. Zhong Li was among the last great court painters in this lineage.This strongly painted composition, the best known of Zhong Li's signed works, is a classic Ming academic-style picture; it continues Dai Jin's (1388–1462) monumental refiguration of the Southern Song academic manner. The interior dynamics are even more spectacular than in earlier works in the tradition, from the explosive energies of the plunging waterfall and dramatically towering cliff face to the twisted pines coiling out like springs from the stone walls. There is also something quite imperial in the pose of the seated figure on the garden terrace, leaning back like the master of his universe to observe the potent forces of nature as they conduct a special performance for him alone."
Scholar_in_the_Wind,"Ren Xun first studied painting with his elder brother, Ren Xiong (1820–1857), but his brother's death, when Xun was twenty-two, cut short the apprenticeship. Three years later he found patrons in Suzhou, and by the 1870s his fame had spread throughout the Yangzi River delta region and he had attracted a number of disciples. He maintained an active career until 1887, when deterioratiing eyesight forced him to curtail painting.In executing figures, Ren often followed Zhejiang artists' regional preference for the style of Ming dynasty professional painters of the so-called Zhe School: dashing virtuoso brushwork and large-scale figures drawn in animated outline strokes set within sketchy inkwash landscapes. Ren employed that style here to suggest a wintry gale pulling at the bare tree branches and whipping through the heavy robes of an intrepid stroller. The figure may be Ren's dramatic evocation of the plight of the traditional gentleman in the face of modernization. His dramatic brush style uses rapidly turning, modulated contour lines to convey graphically the twisting and fluttering folds of the scholar's garment, giving the figure a powerful sense of immediacy."
Lamp-lit_Pavilion_on_a_Rainy_Night,"This work, painted when Qi was seventy-one, evokes a contemplative, even melancholy, mood. Broad streaks of wash and saturated blobs of ink convey a sense of moisture-suffused darkness and lonely isolation. A two-story hall, nearly engulfed by the dark silhouettes of the trees, offers the only sanctuary from the night, its uninked walls and interior standing forth as the sole bright spot in the picture. A scholar seated by a window reads a book by the light of a single lamp.Even though Qi had been a resident of Beijing for fifteen years when he painted this work, he still felt like a stranger there and had a lingering nostalgia for the simpler existence of his childhood home. His confidence in his own vision and his refusal to sink into sentimentality are demonstrated by his boldly brushed dedication, written in the sharp blocky stele style that stands in stark contrast to the soft blurry quality of the image."
Magnolia_and_Bees,The natural appearance of the magnolia blossoms is achieved through fine color gradations and a sparing use of outlines combined with embossing. The inscribed couplet compares their color to glowing jade. This print recalls contemporary paintings rendered in subtle color washes.
Poem_for_Hanwen,"Shen Zhou modeled his writing after the running-regular script of Huang Tingjian (1045–1105); four major works by the Song master were in Shen's personal collection.Despite the small size of the writing on this fan, the characters show the tight interior organization, tall structure, and elongated diagonals and horizontals that are the hallmark of Huang Tingjian's style. In Shen's interpretation, the bony aspect of Huang's brushwork is stressed: the brushwork is simplified and, for the most part, lacks the small movements and stroke details that make the earlier master's writing so rich."
Landscapes,"A brilliant scholar whose official career was cut short by his inadvertent involvement in an examination scandal in 1499, Tang Yin spent his life pursuing the diversions of an eccentric scholarly playboy; his adventures eventually entered popular legend. While most of his paintings reflect a pleasure-loving existence, this melancholy album explores the themes of struggle, sadness, and the refuge of solitude.While most of his fellow painters in the Suzhou area adopted the calligraphic styles of the Yuan scholar-artists, Tang was able to use the more descriptive ink-wash idiom of the Southern Song masters, particularly that of Li Tang (ca. 1070s–ca. 1150s), to portray realistic scenery. This series of leaves shows extraordinary subtlety in portraying the changing effects of weather and season as well as poetic and psychological moods."
Landscapes_in_the_styles_of_ancient_masters,"Wang Jian's paintings exemplify the vision of a man steeped in tradition. A member of the educated elite, Wang enjoyed access to the region's numerous private collections as well as inheriting a rich assemblage of old masters from his grandfather Wang Shizhen (1526–1590). This firsthand knowledge of past masterpieces inspired Wang to follow the example of Dong Qichang (1555–1636) in seeking a personal artistic synthesis through the diligent study of ""orthodox"" models.This album is a virtuoso display of Wang Jian's command over his tradition. Each leaf recalls a specific past master, yet each presents a new solution in which the model is transformed by the smaller, album format as well as by Wang's distinctive brush mannerisms."
Landscape_album,"A scion of a branch of the Ming imperial family, Bada Shanren became a ""crazy"" Buddhist monk, feigning deafness in order to escape persecution after the Ming dynasty fell to Manchu conquest in 1644. Like his cousin Shitao (Zhu Ruoji), he became an extraordinary painter, known for an expessionist calligraphic style.In these album-size landscapes, Bada has adopted traditional themes and compositions as points of departure for his own creative improvisations. In several leaves, the sparse composition, dry brushwork, and carefully selected motifs—bare trees and an empty pavilion—allude to the late Yuan hermit-artist Ni Zan (1306–1374). Elsewhere, diagonally receding mountain masses made of simplified ovoid and cone-shaped rock forms derive from the landscape style of Dong Qichang (1555–1636). In each case, however, Bada transmuted his models, playing with spatially ambiguous patterns or adding human figures or color when least expected."
Kneeling_Attendant,Many of Xie's tracings bear abbreviated annotations regarding the color of the originals.
Squirrel_on_an_Autumn_Branch,"This image displays Xu Gu's virtuosic juxtaposition of the fine brushwork of the squirrel's fur with the bold strokes that define the branches and leaves. Balanced between naturalistic observation and daring abstraction, the animated image is both impressionistic and illusionistic."
Insects_and_Plants,"Throughout his life, Qi Baishi drew inspiration from the objects of everyday existence, particularly the humble flowers, vegetables, and creatures that he observed as a boy. This series of album leaves matches specific insects and objects in a visual chronicle of the seasonal markers of rural life. Juxtaposing insects drawn in an extremely meticulous fine-line style with flowers and vegetables executed in a colorful, freely sketched manner, Qi created a technical tour de force that he proudly entitled: ""What I am capable of!"""
Nine_carp,"A massive carp leads its eight offspring through thick aquatic grasses below the water’s surface. More than just cute animals, they allude to a line from China’s most ancient poetry collection, the Book of Odes (Shijing). It refers to “nine similitudes” (jiuru 九如)—nine comparisons that imply eternity or longevity (“like mountains,” “like streams,” and so on). Because the term for “similitude” (ru 如) sounds like the term for “fish” (yu 魚), paintings of nine fish became conventional expressions of wishes for longevity and constancy. The painter Gong Gu is otherwise unknown, but the splashy brushwork and broad washes suggest a date from the mid- to late nineteenth century."
Washing_the_White_Elephant,"Chen Zi bore both the gift and the burden of being trained by his father Chen Hongshou, one of the most original figure painters ever to wield a brush. The junior Chen was taught to work in an identifiable style with a known market, but the shadow of his father’s accomplishment enveloped him, stifling further growth. This work shows Chen Zi’s competence in producing the exaggerated, caricatured figures for which his father was known, but it also reveals a stiffness that set in through the years of pursuing his father’s legacy. The subject is a play on words with Buddhist significance: “to wash the elephant” (saoxiang) is a homophone for “sweeping away attachments,” a key goal of Buddhist practice."
Bodhidharma,"This painting, done when Qi Baishi was visiting Beijing, presents an image of the fifth-century Chan (Zen) patriarch that is accessible yet monumental. The monklike robe, shoe, and stubble of his shaven head are details that give Bodhidharma a contemporary appearance-not unlike Qi himself. But Qi's vision of the master remains beyond our reach. Except for cursory highlighting around the eye and cheek, Qi avoided Western-influenced tech-niques for rendering form and concealed most of the figure beneath the engulfing robe.Bodhidharma is depicted against a blank background; only the straw prayer mat and the hem of the robe hint at three-dimensional form. Although the bold outlines of the garment and the blunt, square calligraphy of the inscription show close stylistic affinities with the epigraphic school of writing practiced by Zhao Zhiqian (1829–1884), the expressive portrait exhibits the simplicity and directness that characterized Qi's mature style of the 1920s. In his inscription Qi reflects on his inspiration-a visit to Mount Song, where Bodhidharma meditated for nine years-and takes pleasure in acknowledging his own growing critical recognition. He recalls a poem about his painting of a Bodhidharma hung in a Beijing shop that inspired him to repeat his performance here."
Landscape,"It is uncertain when Kuncan took Buddhist monastic vows. After the establishment of the Manchu regime, he lived in Nanjing, where his friends included several artists emotionally tied to the vanquished Ming dynasty. Working exclusively in the landscape genre, Kuncan created dense, firmly structured compositions with brisk, staccato strokes to capture the vitality and abundance of nature. His talent for bringing coherence and grandeur out of complex landscape elements established him as a leading master of this period. Kuncan’s philosophical inscription on this hauntingly somber landscape reads:Master Cheng Lian [a musician, 7th century B.C.] transformed people’s temperament with the sound of ocean waves. Zong Shaowen [the landscape artist Zong Bing, 375–443] did it with echoes in the mountains. Temperament can be transformed to transcend romantic and worldly attachments. Mr. Wang Dengxian [active mid-17th century] studies in the Gaozuo Monastery [in Nanjing], taking rainy woods as his ocean waves and mountain echoes. Every day he strolls in them, chanting his literary compositions and, when gay, singing out loud while tapping trees [to keep time]. He lives as he wishes. My senior Ji once said, “As emotions arise, wisdom is blocked. When thoughts shift, the body changes in accord.” How can anyone say there is no transformation-inducing cinnabar in this process? I painted this landscape to amuse myself. When Mr. Wang saw it, I gave it to him as a present.cat. no. 44"
The_Stone_Bridge,"Zhang Feng's father, a military governor, died in 1631 while defending the Ming dynasty against Manchu incursions. After the fall of the Ming in 1644, Zhang withdrew from society and entered the Buddhist church. This painting, one of Zhang's last dated works, epitomizes the bold, free brush manner of his maturity. It shows a lone scholar in a wintry landscape. Clutching a staff with hands drawn into his sleeves to protect them from the cold, he stands erect and motionless beside a stone bridge. The imagery recalls the natural stone arch at Mount Tiantai, a site sacred to Buddhists. Legend has it that anyone who succeeds in crossing the slippery arch will enter paradise and become an immortal. Zhang's autobiographical figure can neither attain paradise nor return whence he came; he is riveted to the harsh reality of the present, where he must face both his limitations and his mortality.Zhang's inscription reinforces the tension between the figure and his world:Who is it gripping an iron staff in the jade sprayThe torrent's waters ringing beneath the stone bridge?Snow, like flowers' souls, flies about without pause;The spring wind still awaits the mountain man's summons.From the poem it becomes clear that spring's renewal is not forthcoming—the scholar—recluse in the painting is no more able to summon the spring wind than Zhang is capable of restoring the fallen Ming."
Joyous_Rain,"Unlike most of his artistically inclined friends in Suzhou, Wu Kuan enjoyed a long and successful career as an official. He achieved first place in the palace examinations of 1472 and held a series of important posts at the court in Beijing, culminating with the office of secretary of the Board of Rites.Like other Ming literati from Suzhou, Wu Kuan's calligraphy was influenced by Northern Song (960–1127) models. With its fleshy, modulated brushstrokes and squat characters, Wu's writing style follows that of the poet-calligrapher Su Shi (1036–1101). Wu accompanied this poem with a brief account of the circumstances under which it was created: ""On the evening of the twenty-eighth of the fifth month [June 17], it began to rain after a long drought. I was collating Bo Juyi's [772–846] works and had just come to the poem 'Joyous Rain.' Following its rhyme, I composed a poem to express my own joy."""
"Mountain_Market,_Clearing_Mist","This album leaf presents a poetic evocation of one of the Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers. The Eight Views became a popular subject for painters beginning in the late eleventh century after the Chan (Japanese: Zen) Buddhist monk Huihong (1071–1128) composed eight poems on these themes. His poem ""Mountain Market, Clear with Rising Mist"" offers vivid images for painters to interpret:Last night's rain is letting up, mountain air is heavy,Steam rising, sun and shadow, shifting lightamid trees;The silkworm market comes to a close, the crowdthins out,Roadside willows by the market bridge: goldenthreads play;Whose house with flower-filled plot is acrossthe valley?A smooth-tongued yellow bird calls in spring breeze;Wine flag in hazy distance-look and you can see:It's the one west of the road to Zhe Tree ReidgeValley.(Alfreda Murck, trans., in Images of the Mind[Princeton: The Art Museum, Princeton University, 1984], p. 226)In Xia Gui's interpretation, boldly executed brushstrokes and ink dots create an abstract language of visual signs rather than merely descriptive forms: the kinesthetic brushstrokes, which change effortlessly from outlines and foliage dots to wedge-shaped modeling strokes and ink wash, at once simplify and unify the landscape and human forms, breathing life into the moisture-drenched landscape. It was this brilliantly simplified idiom of ink wash and ax-cut brush that infused gesture with meaning, preparing the way for the expressive calligraphic revolution of the ensuing Yuan dynasty."
Flowering_Plum_and_Rock,"Hu Yuan, raised in the arts of painting, calligraphy, and poetry, was denied the income of his gentry birthright when Taiping rebels confiscated his property. He came to Shanghai to earn a living selling paintings.Hu's literal taste is evident in this traditional subject of rock and plum. His inscription records that he first painted the strange and powerful rock by lanternlight on a cold night and then added a branch of winter plum, ""the soul of the world."" Hu's romantic intensity goes beyond the tradition of chaste nobility associated with this genre."
Plum,"Gao was a devotee of plum painting as both collector and painter. He called his painting studio ""King of Plums Pavilion"" and was known among his contemporaries for the motto that appears in the seal impressed on this painting: ""In painting plums I give way to no man."""
Splendid_Autumn_Mountains,"Inscribed by the artist: ""Done in the style of Fangshan (Gao Kegong, 1248–1310). Dedicated to Shaofu for his 70th birthday."""
Herald_of_the_Spring_Breeze,"A fluid surge of ink traces the line of sap in a flowering branch. Zeng's inscription, written in a style that conveys his study of Han clerical script, notes the popularity of plum painting during the Qianlong era (1736–95), but identifies Jin Nong's (1687–1764) plum style as his favorite. Zeng Xi's freely brushed branch in dilute ink expresses his admiration of Jin Nong through emulation."
Four_Poems_in_Cursive_Script,"Dedicated to Lin Yutang and his wife, Yu Youren here transcribes four of his own poems that allude to heroic moments in his life—his youthful aspirations, his near escape from being executed by the Manchu government, and his avid participation in the revolution that founded the Republic of China and the military campaigns for national unification. The tone of the poems also convey Yu's longing to return to China after retreating to Taiwan with the Nationalist government in 1949. The four poems read:I don't believe that youth cannot be retrieved.I will not allow our past glory to turn to ashes.Recalling the banquet in Shanghai celebrating our victory,I toast the ten thousand miles of streams and mountains with a cup of wine.Since the founding of the Republic, how the times have changed!Through those difficult years we campaigned long and hard.The founding fathers have passed away;I am an old soldier still stroking his beard.—Two poems on a photograph taken in the firstyear of the Republic [1912]Splendid streams and mountains remain the same across ten thousand miles.Let this bearded old man search everywhere for poetry.Sitting square on a rock on the beach at this moment,I watch the clouds rising from the vast ocean.—Casually sitting on the beach at Jilong [in northern Taiwan]Unable to fulfill my wish to cultivate and pasture the land,I ran for my life across the river to make history.This year [my birthday] happens to be on Labor Day.The orphan who used to make fireworks has become an old man.—A poem composed on my birthday in the thirtyfourth year of the Republic [1945](trans. by Shi-yee Liu)"
Landscape,"Couched in the Northern Song idioms of Yan Wengui (active ca. 970–1030) and Fan Kuan (active ca. 990–1030), this small landscape by Zhao Yuan exemplifies late Yuan and early Ming scholar painting in which ancient models were transformed by calligraphic brushwork. Late Yuan scholar-artists saw painting as a vehicle for personal expression: painting, it was said, should be like handwriting—a “heart print” of the artist.Executed during a period of political and social turmoil, Zhao’s handscroll reflects a common theme found in paintings of his time: the reclusive life. A secluded mountain villa nestled at the foot of a tall peak suggests a serene existence free from worldly strife.Zhao Yuan, who lived in the south, re-created the towering mountains of the north through his imagination. The last fantastic peak near the far left of the composition was probably inspired by a garden rock—similar to one on display along the west wall of the Museum’s Astor Court."
Landscapes,"All his life Dai pursued a dry, softly textured style, creating evocative images of Daoist reclusion and high-minded self-cultivation. This album, one of the finest examples of Dai’s art, is stylistically datable to his late maturity, circa 1690. In traditional fashion, the album concludes with a snowscape. Dai’s final words on that leaf makes it clear that the intent of his painting is self-expression as well as representation.I clean my inkstone not just to paint,But to reveal the images in my mind."
Viewing_the_Moon_in_an_Empty_Room,"A gentleman and his young son sit in an open hall, viewing the moon through banks of mist. The artist’s inscription indicates that the scene was inspired by a poem of mourning, in which the empty room and the moon evoke the loss of a loved one."
"Poems_on_Paintings,_Written_for_Ma_Yueguan","In this album Jin Nong transcribed thirty-eight poems that he had recently composed. It begins with a set of twenty-four quatrains on the topic of earlier painters from the Tang (618–907) through the Yuan (1271–1368) period, followed by three poems on his self-portrait and others inspired by specific occasions. Jin dedicated this work to Ma Yueguan (1688–1755), a wealthy salt merchant and respected bibliophile in Yangzhou whose coterie included numerous eminent artists and scholars.First known as a talented poet and then as an eccentric calligrapher, Jin Nong had, by this time, also begun to make a name for himself as a painter. His exact, angular brushstrokes, derived from ancient inscriptions carved on stones and bronzes, mellowed slightly in his old age, as here. More than representative of Jin's late writing style, the album alludes to his attainment of the ""Three Perfections"": poetry, calligraphy, and painting."
"Courtly_Odes,_Beginning_with_""Wild_Geese""","In 1127 the Song northern capital was sacked by the Jurchen Jin; Emperor Huizong and members of his family were carried off, only to die later in captivity. The emperor’s ninth son, who was proclaimed Emperor Gaozong (r. 1127–62), escaped and established the Southern Song court at Lin‘an (Hangzhou) in 1138.As emperor, Gaozong sponsored a number of painting and calligraphy projects that extolled the virtues and legitimacy of his “dynastic revival.” The largest of these undertakings was illustrating the more than three hundred poems of the Classic of Poetry, a work traditionally believed to have been compiled by Confucius (551–479 B.C.). Courtly Odes, Beginning with “Wild Geese,” from the Xiaoya section of the Classic, is part of this ambitious program.The text of each poem is written in Gaozong’s regular-script style, probably by a scribe or consort. The accompanying illustrations are the work of Ma Hezhi, a court artist known for his calligrphic “orchid-leaf” brush line, which clearly derived from the scholar-painting tradition of Li Gonglin (ca. 1049–1106). Ma’s deliberately archaistic and simplified drawing style is perfectly in keeping with the great antiquity of the Classic."
Lychees_(a);_Two_Hens_(b),"In the 1940s Qi Baishi felt liberated from competing masters and could barely contain his energy as he painted prolifically. Here, the humble birds filling the fan surface with strong brushwork and colors exhibit the confidence of an unsurpassed master."
The_Pure_Whiteness_of_Winter,"Flowering through snow and cold, plum blossoms are popular symbols of court beauties and of reclusion; as such, they embody romance, tears, lost loves, and the eternal return of springtime. Xu Jing entitled his painting The Pure Whiteness of Winter, partaking of a tradition of imagery in poetry and painting that goes back one thousand years."
Cat,"Ren Yi won broad acceptance for colorful 19th century populist art, particularly through his influence on Wu Changshuo. His style continues to influence 20th century painting; Zhang Yugong's Cat belongs to this tradition, and as a teacher at the Shanghai Art College, Zhang guaranteed continuation of the line."
Peaches,The artist's wonderfully eccentric style is abstract but still within the limits of traditional painting and calligraphy. He retreats from the wind and rain outside his door to the painting table and the artist's age-old pastime.
Looking_at_the_Moon,"Lu's reputation in Shanghai, Nanjing and Hangzhou rested largely on paintings of beautiful ladies. Here in verse and painting, he muses on the swift passage of life."
Peonies,"Chen Banding was a student of Wu Changshuo, and the flowers in this fan, boldly sketched in elegant fluid line show Chen's indebtedness to his teacher."
Children_on_Water-buffaloes,"During the 1950s and 1960s, Li Keran was confined to a compound in Peking with several other artists and intellectuals and their families. Despite restrictions, he continued to work. These paintings appeared as paper in the communal latrine, where they were rescued by a fellow artist."
"Landscapes,_Figures,_and_Flowers","This exquisite album, done when Chen Hongshou was between twenty and twenty-four, exhibits a broad range of subject matter and an extraordinarily fastidious brush style that attest to his reputation as a youthful prodigy. Not long after the album was completed, the noted connoisseur and artist Chen Jiru added his critical comments opposite several of the leaves in the album, a further confirmation of Chen Hongshou's recognition among his contemporaries.In the first leaf, the bleak scene of an untended garden presents a powerful image of the decay infecting late Ming society just twenty–five years before the dynasty was toppled by the Manchus. In his accompanying inscription Chen asks, ""Does anybody notice?"" In subsequent leaves, Chen's evocations of Li Gonglin's (ca. 1041–1106) monochrome drawing (baimiao) figural style, Ni Zan's (1306–1374) dry trees, Wang Meng's (ca. 1308–1385) cloudlike mountains, and Qian Xuan's (ca. 1235–before 1307) archaic ""blue-and-green"" landscapes reveal his command of past idioms and his affinity for earlier scholar-recluse artists, while a depiction of the Solitary Elegant Peak in Guilin reveals Chen's early interest in the fantastic landscapes of the eccentric professional artist Wu Bin (ca. 1583–1626)."
"[Studio_Portrait:_Two_Women_Standing_Beside_a_Table,_Hong_Kong]","The carte de visite, a format comprised of an approximately 2 x 4 inch photograph mounted to card stock, was perhaps the most ubiquitous of nineteenth-century photographs. The French studio portrait photographer André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri first patented the carte in 1854. His innovation of exposing not just one but eight photographic images on the same glass plate negative enabled cartes to be made cheaply and reproduced on a mass scale. During the late 1850s and throughout the latter half of the century, these economical keepsakes depicting portraits of loved ones, celebrities, monarchs, and foreign types circulated en masse and spurred a veritable ""cartomania."" Collected in albums, traded among friends, and admired in drawing rooms, cartes put photography in the hands of virtually everyone, and thus offered a means of reflecting upon one’s own social standing in an ever-expanding world."
"Crabapple,_China_rose,_and_Indian_flycatcher","This sumptuous painting evokes a rebus, or multipart visual pun, that transforms it from a decorative image into one laden with meaning. The two long-tailed birds (shoudai niao 綬帶鳥) symbolize “double longevity” (shuangshou 雙壽), while the rose (yueji 月季) and crabapple (haitang 海棠) stand for “high hall” (gaotang 高堂), a respectful term for one’s parents. Taken together, the pictures encode a wish of “long life for your parents.”"
Celestial_maiden,"Xie brightened the colors used to describe this heavenly attendant, which he copied from an early Tang dynasty (618–907) mural in a cave temple at Dunhuang."
Lu_Ji’s_Essay_on_Literature,"Wen Zhengming was one of China’s defining calligraphers. A passionate art collector and student of the past, Wen developed signature manners across different script types of calligraphy, from the formality of regular script to the ease of semicursive to the swashbuckling confidence of cursive. This late work shows Wen’s working in his highly ordered small regular script, a perfectly balanced combination of structure, angularity, and fluidity."
Poem_on_reclusion,"Zha Sheng’s talents as a poet and calligrapher won him praise at the early Qing court, where he served as a scholar-official. This transcription of a poem by the famous Northern Song recluse Lin Bu (967–1028) extols the virtues of a simple life, but the message is somewhat at odds with the luxurious gold satin upon which the piece is written. The poem reads, in part:Bamboo and trees surround my dwelling,A clear stream provides more than enough excitement.At ease, a crane lingers a while by the water,Lazily, bees relax as flowers are few.—Translation after Shi-yee Liu"
The_Pleasures_of_Fishes,"Zhou Dongqing was a friend of Wen Tianxiang (1236–1283), the famous Song loyalist and a fellow native of Jiangsi Province. Zhou's painting was inspired by a passage from the Daoist classic Zhuangzi (ca. fourth century B.C.), in which Zhuangzi, strolling along a river, observes, ""See how the minnows come out and dart around where they please! That's what fish really enjoy!"" His companion Huizi remarks, ""You're not a fish—how do you know what fish enjoy?"" Zhuangzi replies, ""You are not I, so how do you know I don't know what fish enjoy?""In the inscription at the end of the painting the artist has written:Not being fish, how do we know their happiness?But we may express our feelings in our painting.In order to probe the subtleties of the ordinary,We must describe the indescribable.Painted on paper instead of silk, the work's muted colors and flat patterns of pale inkwash evoke a mood of detachment and withdrawal, which Zhou's inscription reinforces. Born in Linjiang, not far from the Daoist center at Mount Longhu (Dragon Tiger Mountain), Zhou may have been strongly influenced by Daoism."
Crows_and_Bare_Trees_in_Winter,"In this small landscape, groves of straight trees stand in snow. A pale, thin river threads its way to the horizon. This painting and others of austere wintry scenes may reflect the traditional Chinese belief that the natural world responds to human affairs. The twelfth-century historian Liu Zheng commented.The feelings of mountains and streams, grassesand trees, are not far from those of humans,and it is wrong to think of them as non sentient.That a stream should dry up in timesof disorder is an ordinary, natural reaction."
Peahen_and_hibiscus,"This monumental flower-and-bird composition shows the Uighur Bian Lu working in the highly polished tradition of the Song Imperial Painting Academy. Only the calligraphic character of the drawing, particularly noticeable in the rhythmic outlines of the leaves, betrays its fourteenth-century date.The meticulously detailed plumage of the peacock, the gritty texture of the rock, and the delicately shaded leaves and blossoms are a tour de force of representational illusionism. The bird's pose, dramatically balanced on one leg as it prepares to take another step, may refer to a famous anecdote about the Song emperor Huizong, who chided his court painters for failing to observe that when climbing, the peacock always takes the first step with its left leg."

Landscapes,"In this gemlike album, which chronicles the changing seasons, Ye Xin, one of the leading Nanjing painters of his day, lovingly depicts the rural scenery around his native city. A sensitive and lyrical recorder of the familiar, Ye was also an innovative experimenter with light, atmosphere, and color. His art also reflects a creative response to Western images introduced to China by Jesuits in the late sixteenth century. This tiny album, small enough to tuck into one’s sleeve, would have been the perfect companion for a scholar in a garden setting or for a day’s excursion."
"Cranes,_Pine_Tree,_and_Lichen","Ren Yi, the son of a rice merchant, was trained in a portrait shop. Ren developed a popular richly colored style for figures and for flower-and-bird and landscape paintings, becoming a leading artist in Shanghai by the 1870s, with a large circle of eminent friends and students, such as the literatus Wu Changshi (1844–1927).Cranes, fungus, and pine are emblems of long life, but the artistic ambition of this imposing picture, all angles and fitted parts, goes beyond that of the traditional auspicious birthday picture. The complex pictorial structure, formed by interlocking triangles, seems to draw on the relationship of figure and ground at the heart of seal carving, an art greatly appreciated in the nineteenth century. Ren also may have been inspired by the strong overlapping silhouettes on a shallow ground seen in Japanese art, particularly screens."
Poem_by_Wang_Wei,"明 張瑞圖 行書王維詩句 軸 紙本Zhang Ruitu transcribed this poem in vigorous—almost violent—strokes, with the speed and pressure of his hand splitting the hairs of the brush to create an effect known as “flying white” (feibai). The scale and ferociousness of the calligraphy is in tension with the tranquil message of the poem by Wang Wei, which reads:As you have passed many years writing books behindclosed doors,The pines planted long ago have all grown scales likeold dragons.—Trans. by Shi-yee Liu"

Poems,"明 陳洪綬 行書詩翰 冊 紙本Revered primarily as a painter of eccentric, stylized human figures, Chen Hongshou also created a rich oeuvre of calligraphy. In this album, he transcribed a set of his own poems for a close friend named Shen Yaozhang (d. 1666). The calligraphy is exemplary of the crisp elegance of his late style. Chen seems to have used a long, slender brush with a finely tapering tip to create the sharply pointed hooks and diagonal strokes. The characters are lively with a natural ease; they are expressive but never wild."

"Lofty_Scholar_among_Streams_and_Mountains,_in_the_manner_of_Juran","The Orthodox school master Wang Jian seldom painted figures or architecture. In this painting, however, Wang, who claims in his inscription to have been inspired by a work of the same title by Juran (act. ca. 960–95), has depicted a scholar seated in a handsome two-story studio overlooking an expanse of river. The idea of a mountain retreat also recalls Wang Wei's (699–759) Wangchuan Villa.The mountain forms, made with round ""hemp-fiber"" texture strokes and rich ""alum-head"" moss dots, are characteristic of the Juran brush idiom as interpreted by the Yuan master Wu Zhen (1280–1354). By executing the round arcs of these strokes in a rhythmical manner, Wang Jian invented the undulating compositional movements that his pupil Wang Hui (1632–1717) developed into the so-called dragon-vein principle."
Yang_Xiong’s_Prefaces_to_Model_Statements,"清 趙之謙 隷書楊子法言序 橫幅 紙本Zhao Zhiqian is the only calligrapher represented in this exhibition by works in three different script types: seal, standard, and, here, clerical. This work, a transcription of writings by the Han dynasty philosopher Yang Xiong (53 B.C.–A.D. 18), demonstrates Zhao’s command of the clerical script canon, in particular the “Stele for Cao Quan,” a favorite of Epigraphic School calligraphers."
"West_Lake,_Hangzhou:_Jingci_Temple","According to Xie's inscription, this is a view of the right side of the Jingci Temple, a famous site on West Lake."
Landscapes_and_trees,"By the mid-1670s Gong Xian’s confidence as a painter had taught him to avoid an overly skillful or popular style. He wrote:“Nowadays when people paint they do only what appeals to the common eye; I alone do not seek to please the present.”In this album, both paintings and inscriptions attest to Gong’s striving after a spiritual communion with earlier masters while creating a pictorial vocabulary all his own. Departing from his densely textured, monumental landscape style of the 1660s, Gong moved toward a sparser manner in which each brushstroke is made to function calligraphically as well as descriptively, embodying both expressive and representational meaning. The album’s format—paintings accompanied by art-historical comments—reminds us that Gong Xian taught painting for a living."
Lotus_and_Kingfisher,"Yu Feian brought the meticulous painting style and the ""slender gold"" calligraphy of Song emperor Huizong (r. 1101–26) to life in the 20th century.Yu Feian's rejuvenation of the ""realistic"" painting style reflects the interest in realism among his contemporaries under stimulus from Western art. The so-called ""magical realism"" of the Song Academy styles takes on an air of surreal magic in Yu's 20th century incarnation."
Cicada,"Wu paints the cicada clinging to an autumn willow branch in the wet-ink manner of the 18th century Yangzhou Eccentrics. A willow branch suits Wu's calligraphic talent. As with bamboo painting, willow painting demands that each nuance of a leaf's form and texture be conveyed by a single line."
"Inspired_by_My_""Western_Mountain_Poem""","Pu Ru, brother of the last emperor of China, Pu Yi, was the most talented painter among the princes of the Qing royal family. After the fall of the dynasty, Pu Ru took degrees in astronomy and biology in Berlin and then taught at the Imperial University in Tokyo in the late 1920s. Returning to China, he taught at the National Art Academy in Beijing, the art college within Beijing University."
Squirrels,"Qi's cunning creatures seem to brim with life. As his art grew in popularity, its very appeal raised the question of its merit. Confiding in a friend, Qi observed that simplicity is a quality hard won."
Fungus,"Qi painted this fungus for Wang Xuetao on the occasion of Wang's 41st birthday. The plan, long believed to contain properties conferring immortality, commonly appeared in birthday greetings. Qi, already in his 81st year had more than a vicarious interest in such matters."
Milking,The artist's inscription reports that this is a scene from Tibetan life observed while traveling in the Qinghai region in 1952 and done from memory later in Xian.After the Long March there was romantic fascination among many artists for the landscapes and peoples of China's western regions. Art depicting the simple lives of these remote folk tended to be both picturesque and politically correct. Shi Lu's painting is characteristically sympathetic without recourse to sentimentality.
Poems,"Pu Ru's literati training emerges in his painting and calligraphy. The painting of a scholar in his studio by the water is straight from the classical repertory of themes, and Pu composes a poem to accompany it. The lines on the facing album leaf written for other paintings, trace the flow of the artist's consciousness from experience to poem to painting, and round again."
Boy_on_a_Water-buffalo,"During the 1950s and 1960s, Li Keran was confined to a compound in Peking with several other artists and intellectuals and their families. Despite restrictions, he continued to work. These paintings appeared as paper in the communal latrine, where they were rescued by a fellow artist."
Winter_landscape_with_fisherman,"A professional painter from Nanjing, Shi Zhong was noted for his eccentric manner and unrestrained style of painting. Employing a dazzling combination of pale ink washes, dark outlines, and texture strokes, Shi's spontaneous execution led him to favor winter scenery in which his scratchy trees and jagged rocks would stand forth against the unpainted white of the paper background.On this work, the artist, who signs himself ""Old Fool,"" has added an enigmatic poem suggesting that his spontaneous style represents an effort to attain an unencumbered naturalness:The Hall of the Xiang River immortal is as clean as water,May my brush be as truthful as that of an old fool.It seems that the waterfalls and rocks can avoid vulgarity,I, too, know that in attaining samadhi [enlightenment]one may achieve the divine."
Hezhang_Peak,"Were it not for the inscription, Lin Shu's painting might be taken for an idealized mountain landscape with a generic scholar gazing from a bridge. Lin writes that he has visited the wonderful caves and peaks of Wenzhou in Zhejiang, and that he is painting this fan as a ""preview"" for a friend who will accompany him on the same trip the following day."
Plum,"The influence of literati ideals in professional circles is evident in the work of Jin Lan, one of the Nine Friends of Shanghai. This elegant fan is painted, says Jin, in the style of Wang Mian (1287–1359), the Yuan master of ink plums. In the manner of Ming plum blossom painters, Jin washed the surface of the fan with pale silvery blue, leaving a full moon and the blossoms in reserve. The picture shimmers with moonlight, and the blossoms all bu disappear against the radiance, preserved by dark ink flecks that suggest sepals, petals and stamen. There is a fairy tale-like mystery to the tiny blossoms alive in the moonlight, delicate and evanescent.Jin Lan dedicated his fan to Lu Hui, a student of Liu Deliu and an admired artist."
Rooster_and_coxcomb,"Qi Baishi delighted in visual puns and rebuses. Here, the combination of cockscomb (jiguan 雞冠) and rooster (gongji 公雞) evokes the phrase “may you rise in rank” (guanshang jiaguan 官上加官), a wish for professional promotion. Qi inscribed the second half of this phrase as the title of the painting at top right."
Plum_blossoms,"Jin Nong started painting plum blossoms in 1756 at the age of sixty-nine. This monochrome album was reportedly painted during a six-week stay at Luo Ping's home in Yangzhou in 1757.Jin Nong's innovative plum paintings are poised between representation and abstraction. The images range from the exuberance of lacy blossom-laden boughs to the restrained elegance of a single budding branch. There is a graphic quality to Jin Nong's compositions, achieved through a tight interlocking of painted image, calligraphy, and seals. His poetic inscriptions, written in his typically exact, vigorous manner, not only deepen the meaning of his imagery, but also act as graphic motifs that further animate each composition."
Bamboo_and_rock,"Deng Yu, a leading late Yuan literary Daoist, joined the Orthodox Unity sect of Daoism at the age of twelve. By 1360 he had become the abbot of a Daoist temple in Wenzhou, near the Zhejiang coast, and in 1371 he accompanied the 42nd Celestial Master to the Ming capital, where he repeatedly performed miracles of rainmaking.Bamboo and Rock, executed according to the precepts of the early Yuan scholar-artist Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322), demonstrates Deng's familiarity with the literati aesthetic of calligraphic painting. The bamboo leaves are done in clerical script; the stalks, in seal script; and the rocks, drawn in mixed ink tones, simulate the ""flying-white"" style of calligraphy. A poem inscribed by Liu Renben, the governor-general of Wenzhou under the rebel leader Fang Guozhen, establishes the date of Deng's painting:After fog and rain, in Jiangnan,Few friends of integrity remain.As autumn fills the shores of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers,Clouds paint the bamboo a deep green."
Mandarin_ducks_and_cotton_rose_hibiscus,"Big, colorful, and dazzling, this painting demonstrates why Lü Ji became the most revered bird-and-flower painter at the court of the Ming emperor Hongzhi (r. 1488–1505). Hung in a palace, this work would have added a splash of pizzazz, brightening the interior space with the vitality of the natural world. Like most of Lü’s paintings, this one also has a symbolic dimension: the pair of mandarin ducks in the foreground connote a happy marriage, while the surrounding flowers form rebuses (visual puns) that underscore the message. For instance, the word for “hibiscus” (furong 芙蓉) combines with “cassia” (gui 桂) to form the rebus furong qigui 夫榮妻貴, meaning “prosperous groom, honorable bride”—the perfect painting to celebrate a wedding."
Landscape,"Nearly all of Zou Zhilin’s surviving paintings are rendered in a simplified, almost cartoonish combination of chunky lines and dots. Here, he uses this unusual idiom to describe a humble riverside village backed by distant mountains."
Ten_Sites_Associated_with_Ruan_Yuan,"During the nineteenth century, the scholar-official Ruan Yuan towered over the cultural life of the city of Yangzhou. A deeply proud Yangzhou native, Ruan Yuan sponsored major building and publishing projects that valorized his home city, becoming, for many people of his day, the face of Yangzhou. This album depicts ten famous sites in Yangzhou associated with Ruan Yuan, from his family temples to historical sites that he patronized. Equal parts a visual biography of a man and a portrait of a place, this unusual album shows the creative potential of the format, in which the civic and the personal can be interwoven into a single, multiphase story."
Circular_box,"Produced in Hunan Province in the south, Changsha wares were among the first examples of Chinese ceramics to feature prominently in maritime trade. The parrots painted on the lid further illustrate international taste as these birds were originally imported into China from Indonesia."
Poem,"明/清 傅山 草書七言絕句 軸 絹本This monumental work is a perfect visual encapsulation of Fu Shan’s credo: “Better awkward than clever, better ugly than charming, better fragmented than slick, better straightforward than calculating.” Works by Fu’s contemporaries Ni Yuanlu and Wang Duo also achieve the effect of intentional “ugliness,” but they do so by different means. Where Ni and Wang use quirky angles and shifts of direction, Fu uses free—seemingly uncontrollable—meandering, rounded lines. All three saturate the surface of the silk with splotches of wet ink, a bold gesture that goes against traditional ideas of beauty in calligraphy.The poem reads:Taking things easy in old age, I shun all worldly engagements,And sleep day after day behind the tightly shut doors of my rustic home.But then deep feelings stir up attachments;A red lotus blossoms in the rain.—Trans. by Shi-yee Liu"
Vase_in_Meiping_Shape,"Yellow, which is a color associated with the earth in Chinese culture, has often been reserved for the use of the emperor in ceramics and textiles. Other members of the imperial family have been assigned other colors such as white or green, depending on their rank."
Wang_Wei’s_“Peach_Blossom_Spring”,"明/清 弘仁 行楷書王維桃源行 扇面 紙本As a painter, the monk-artist Hongren was celebrated for his images of Yellow Mountain (Huangshan), which used austere dry lines to capture a sense of the strange majesty of that landscape. He was less influential as a calligrapher, but he developed a charming and recognizable style that combined tall, occasionally boxy character forms with sinuous lines. The text is Wang Wei’s (699–761) poetic variation on Tao Yuanming’s (365–427) beloved “Peach Blossom Spring,” an allegorical tale of paradise found and lost."
Poem_dedicated_to_Wen_Zhenmeng_(1574–1636),"明 黃道周 草書五言詩 軸 絹本Around the same time that clerical script was evolving from seal script, an even faster, more informal type of writing was developing alongside it: cursive script. Huang Daozhou was one of the leading exponents of cursive script during the late Ming dynasty (1568–1644). Huang’s brush races, not even pausing to lift between characters, creating cascades of text as it moves down each column. From the time of its birth around 200 B.C., cursive script has been in continuous use in China."
Rustic_retreat_among_fishermen,"Zhou Wenjing served as a court painter in the Beijing imperial palace. His artistic abilities became known when he was summoned to court as a soothsayer and won first prize in a painting competition sponsored by the Xuande emperor (r. 1426–35). Zhou was still active as a court painter in 1463.This small hanging scroll elucidates Ming accounts describing how Zhou Wenjing followed the styles of both the Southern Song Academy master Xia Gui (act. ca. 1190–1225) and the Yuan scholar-painter Wu Zhen (1280–1354). The painting's large proportion of empty space, the intimate focus, and the use of mineral colors on silk recall the highly selective ""one-corner"" landscapes of the Song Academy. Zhou's intentionally naive rendering of figures and calligraphic treatment of foreground grasses and foliage patterning, however, are derived from scholar paintings of the late Yuan. This painting probably decorated a small panel or screen in the living quarters of the palace."
Poem_on_Boating_on_the_Qinhuai_River,"清 梅清 行書秦淮舟泛詩 軸 紙本As an artist, Mei Qing is best remembered for his paintings, and the dramatic variations of ink tonality in this rare, purely calligraphic work reveal a painterly sensibility. The poem, also composed by Mei, relates the delights of boating in the evening with a friend on the Qinhuai River in Nanjing and celebrates the city’s vibrant night life, as reflected in the last line: “The flute music is hard to resist when intoxicated.” The poem may have been composed in the 1680s, when Mei visited his friend, the famous monk-artist Shitao (1642–1707), in Nanjing."
Three_poems,"明 文彭 草書五言詩三首 冊 紙本Here, Wen Peng follows the style of Sun Guoting (646–691), a leading calligrapher of the Tang dynasty (618–907) who was revered for his cursive writing. By the midsixteenth century, genuine works by Sun had become scarce. Born to the eminent Wen family of Suzhou, which boasted a great art collection and access to others in the area, Wen Peng might still have had the opportunity to study original calligraphy by Sun.In this album Wen Peng transcribes three poems, presumably of his own composition, on the subjects of appreciating peach blossoms, a literary gathering in a Daoist temple, and cloudy mountains. In contrast to the monumental clerical script of the Thousand-Character Classic, these lyrical poems are written in small cursive script. The simplified forms of the characters and the freely linking brushstrokes create a sense of fluidity and animation."
The_Story_of_Chen_Zhongzi,"清 金農 漆書 冊 紙本Jin Nong’s calligraphy was inspired in part by ancient stone inscriptions, which were revered in eighteenth-century Yangzhou. As a young artist, Jin received critical acclaim for his clerical-script calligraphy. After failing the examination to enter officialdom at the age of fifty, he seems to have turned away from traditional clerical script, adapting and exaggerating elements of it to create the idiosyncratic personal style known as “lacquer script.” The transcription in this album of the story of Chen Zhongzi, a famous recluse from the fourth century B.C., is representative of Jin’s mature style. The characters are tall rather than squat; the horizontal strokes are swept onto the paper with a flattened brush tip; and the vertical strokes and left-downward diagonals turn spiky toward the ends."
Poem_on_a_River_Sojourn,"明 王鐸 行書宿江上詩 軸 絹本Wang Duo’s style is marked by calculated imbalances. In this scroll, he twists the right sides of his characters outward, creating a studied awkwardness that appealed to the seventeenth-century taste for the rough and bold. Some scholars link Wang’s style to the turmoil of the times, when the native Ming dynasty was conquered by invaders, known as the Manchus, who established the Qing dynasty in 1644. Wang was a high official in the Ming court, and when the dynasty fell, he followed the refugee court south to Nanjing, where it held on for another year. It was during this time, in 1645, that Wang made this work."
Five_poems_on_plum_blossoms,"清 石濤 楷書梅花詩五首 扇面 紙本Shitao created this fan as a professional artist in Yangzhou, after relinquishing Buddhist monkhood in the mid-1690s. The plainness of the paper and the choice of poems on plum blossoms suggest the work was made for a scholar. The text is written in standard script, but the flaring downward diagonal strokes reveal Shitao’s study of clerical script. Shitao’s mixing of different script types foreshadows calligraphic trends of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This fan was originally designed to be folded, but, as often happens with examples by important artists, it was later remounted as an album leaf."
Palace_Poem_by_Wang_Jian_(d._830?),"明 米萬鍾 草書宮詞 軸 紙本Mi Wanzhong was one of a group of prominent calligraphers of the late Ming dynasty who abandoned studious refinement in favor of bold displays of personal expression. The poem, composed by Wang Jian, a renowned Tang dynasty (618–907) poet, describes a majestic imperial ceremony. Mi transcribed the text in cursive, the most casual script, in which character forms are abbreviated and the calligrapher does not always pause to lift the brush between characters. Using cursive script allowed Mi to move quickly and decisively and to emphasize the power and energy of his movements rather than the finer points of brush and ink."
Poem,"清朝 伊秉綬 隷書 橫幅 紙本Yi Bingshou’s clerical script, seen in the large characters on the right side of this work, was admired for its deliberate awkwardness, with tall, skinny characters written in broad, blunt lines. His semicursive script, which he used for the small dedication on the left, provides the perfect counterpoint. It combines old character forms and sinuous lines into a playful and historically informed pastiche that spoke to other members of the Epigraphic School. The text reads:Moonbeams over Lake Dongting’s waters;Orchid fragrance mingled in mists of theXiao-Xiang Rivers.Mr. Yunbo praised this verse of minein the highest terms, so I have written itout here in order to seek his friendship.Written in mid-autumn of the renshen year (1812),Bingshou."
The_Thousand-Character_Classic,"明 文彭 隸書千字文 冊 紙本When Wen Peng created this album in 1561, his choice of clerical script was unusual, as was the oversized scale of the characters. The text, known as the Thousand-Character Classic, was used by nearly all calligraphers to hone their skills, but it was more commonly written in semicursive, cursive, or standard script. Writing it in clerical script was a slow and laborious process, but the result is novel: a bold, muscular twist on a classic. Wen was one of the first calligraphers to look back to clerical script for inspiration. This practice became common three centuries later."
"Snowscape,_from_Album_for_Zhou_Lianggong","This painting and its accompanying inscription belonged to an album made for the noted Nanjing collector and high official Zhou Lianggong (1612–1672). A leading patron of contemporary artists, Zhou assembled a number of these albums during the last twenty-five years of his life, when his career required him to travel extensively. Such collaborative works have long been a means for a group of artists to commemorate special occasions, but Zhou’s albums, which sometimes encompassed hundreds of contributions, fulfilled a different function: they included works by professionals and scholar-amateurs, Ming loyalists and Qing officials, traditionalist orthodox painters and innovative individualists. By inviting a wide spectrum of artists to both view and contribute to these albums, Zhou created a unique forum for artists to learn from and appraise one another’s productions."

Returning_Home,"Landscapes alternate with flowers in this album of twenty-four small leaves of paintings and poetic comments that is designed to be perused slowly, one pair of leaves at a time. Each painting and its accompanying poem were conceived as a single expressive image in a superb harmony of painting, poetry, and calligraphy. The paintings are ""written"" with the same type of brushstrokes as the calligraphy, while in the ""painterly"" calligraphy individual characters and brushstrokes in varying sizes and ink tones frequently imitate such pictorial motifs as orchid petals and leaves and misty and wavy landscape elements. Even the painter's seals are integrated into the design.Shitao (""Stone Wave""), a scion of the Ming imperial family, became a monk and a painter after the Manchu conquest of 1644. After many years of wandering from place to place in the south and spending nearly three years in Beijing, he ""returned home"" to Yangzhou toward the end of 1692."
Scroll_A1,"Xing created her Scroll series in the summers of 1999 and 2000 while she was in Beijing in-between semesters at New York’s School of Visual Art. Scroll A1 presents people at their leisure along a traditional covered walkway. Using one roll of film for this composition, Xing consciously references both the cinematic filmstrip and the traditional handscroll format, creating a journey through shifting perspectives and changes in scale."
Studio_in_an_Autumn_Grove,"In a thatch-roofed pavilion next to a rock by the water’s edge, two scholars sit engrossed in conversation. Behind them, an assistant fans a brazier, heating water for tea. A grove of ancient trees rises around them, the foliage a blaze of autumn colors. The mountains in the distance enclose the scholars’ moment of reclusion within a safe and placid haven. Born in Anhui, Ding Yunpeng spent formative years in Suzhou, where he became friendly with students and descendants of Wen Zhengming; this early work reflects his knowledge of the gentle palette and soft, meticulous texturing used by Wen and his followers."
Landscapes_after_Ancient_Masters,"Mei Qing’s most prolific period as a painter was from 1690 to 1695. Specializing in the intimate format of the album, he often returned to a familiar set of compositional types that he varied slightly in each execution. In this album, Mei presented his highly personal interpretations of the old masters, treating his models creatively as points of departure for his own highly original compositions. Mei further enhanced the variety of images by alternating grand panoramas with intimate close-ups and by using a different seal on all but one leaf."
Birds_and_Narcissus,"Xu Xiang was first a student of Qian Huian, but later studied with Ren Yi and adopted a freer brush technique. In this fan, the easy naturalism of the pair of birds, whose white markings are used like highlights, contrasts with the rather still flower cluster frontally depicted in outline technique. Juxtaposition of different techniques and a strange lack of consistent scale combine to produce a picture that does not quite hold together, but it nonetheless describes the liberties that artists were free to take in the cosmopolitan climate of Shanghai."
Pine,"Yang Yi, a member of the literati circle of painters in Shanghai, was a calligrapher and poet as well as a painter. He was particularly skilled in Han clerical script (li shu). The compact clusters of bluntly stroked needles in this pine show his calligraphic training. He writes in his inscription that the pine is done in the style of Daoji (1642–1707)."
Landscape,"Wu Xizai was a philologist and student of Bao Shichen. Wu's painting embodies the calligraphic taste for powerful, rich brushstrokes that engage the paper to create well defined forms and opaque palpable voids. Wu, like Zhao Zhiqian was an avid admirer and practitioner of seal carving, and the dramatic tension of his robust solids and voids, fitting like pieces of a puzzle into a tightly organized surface, brings the seal carver's aesthetic into landscape painting."
Scholar_on_the_Bridge,"Ni Tian successfully imitated Ren Yi's popular style, ensuring that a second generation of Shanghai patrons could still buy Ren Yi-style works. The freely impressionistic foliage in this fan converts a conventional image of a scholar in a landscape into a fashionable fin-de-siècle production. Layers of built-up ink in the foreground trees project the branches forward in the manner of a spatial experiment undertaken by Ren Yi."
Heavenly_Cave_in_the_Immortal_World,"Huang says in his inscription that the painting is done in the style of Wen Zhengming (1470–1559), but the adaptations to 19th century taste are clear. Color is heightened, figure and ground shift ambiguously and the dense composition is demarcated by a strong, regularly accented line.Huang was a minor official but at the age of fifty, he succumbed to his love of painting and became a professional artist in Shanghai."
Squirrel_and_Cherries,"Qi learned from Zhu Da the high drama of letting images seem to venture into the picture space from the borders and disappear beyond them. Qi admired Zhu Da's ability to enliven the empty as well as the occupied space of a picture. Although his line was never as highly inflected as Zhu Da's, nor the scale of his ink as subtle, Qi achieved some of Zhu's effects through clean silhouette and telling gesture."
Mynah,"Qi stayed in Peking against the advice of friends when the Japanese invaded the north of China in 1931. With exception of a visit to Sizhuan in 1936, he remained there during the war between 1937 and 1945. He says in his diary that he was too old to flee with either ease or stealth.During this period in Peking, he continued to paint, simplifying and strengthening his style, taking direct inspiration from the 17th century individualist Badashanren. Qi learned from the monk-painter the importance of what is not painted in a picture, for example, the white markings at the myna's throat in this work."
Cabbage_and_Bamboo_Shoot,"Like Shitao (1642–1707) and Wu Changshi (1844–1927) before him, Qi Baishi loved to paint vegetables. He was particularly fond of plump cabbages, rendering their ruffled leaves and crisp ribs with an affection traditionally reserved for peonies or lotuses. His approach to the beauty of the commonplace struck a responsive chord with the contemporary movement in literature, which rejected the stilted classical language of the elite in favor of a simple and earthy vernacular."
Travelling_Amid_Streams_and_Mountains,"Feng Zikai's intellectual development was fostered under the tutelage of the influential Buddhist scholar and painter Li Shutong (Hungyi). Later Feng studied in Japan, learning Western drawing and music. when he returned to China he answered the call for an art responsive to the needs of a broadly defined national culture, not with politically rhetorical pictures but with moving, humane depictions of common people in real situations. Here the scholarly pastime of appreciating nature is enjoyed by two moderns on horseback."
Orchid_and_Rock,"Ning Fucheng, an amateur, was a painter's painter. He lived modestly working as a clerk and studying Han and Qin seal scripts while painting on his own. He exhibited his works only briefly in the 1960s. His paintings, often done with his fingernail and his seal-carving style made a deep impression on other painters.The man's character is well reflected in the image he chose for this painting—an orchid, unattended, clinging to the crevices of an isolated rock, unleashing its intense fragrance into the mountain air."

Landscape,"Wang was a full-fledged scholar in the Hanlin Academy in Peking. His painting style, while influenced by the intellectual rigor of Dong Qichang (1555–1636), took on the appealing attributes of mid-19th century style, evident here in the gold-flecked ground, soft color and free brushwork."
Landscape_in_the_Style_of_Old_Masters,"Qi Gong was a member of the Qing royal family who became an important scholar of philology and textual criticism in the New China. His painting style is influenced by Qing orthodox masters. His inscription characteristically records a bit of connoisseurship: he says this painting in the style of Yüan masters was copied from an album by Wang Yuanqi (1642–1715) in a private collection. The album, according to Qi, was the equal of Qing Imperial examples."
Bird,"Ju Chao's inscription on this decorative fan says the bird is done in the style of the Yangzhou Eccentric Luo Ping (1773–99). Behind Luo Ping 's and Ju Chao's pictures is the idealized realism of the 12th century Song Academy painters. By the 19th century however, nature is no longer a mystery touched through painting; like Ju Chao's bird, it is a very material reality made a painter's plaything."
Landscape_in_the_style_of_Yang_Sheng,"The eighth-century painter Yang Sheng is said to have specialized in the “boneless” (mogu, 没骨) technique: the application of broad washes of color unbounded by contour lines. In this sumptuous fan, the late nineteenth-century artist Wu Guxiang explores Yang’s technique, using rich applications of malachite green, azurite blue, and even washes of gold pigment for the distant mountains. The result is a haunting magical place, with the roofs of a small cluster of buildings the only suggestion of a human presence."
Pavilion_beside_a_rock_garden_and_stream,"When Gu Linshi painted this fan in 1921, literati gardens of the type depicted were fast disappearing. During the nineteenth century, many famous gardens were destroyed in wars and rebellions, and after the revolution of 1911, gardens of wealthy families fell into disrepair. Here, Gu paints in the style of the sixteenth-century artist Qian Gu, whose patrons owned some of the most opulent gardens of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644)."
Landscape,"As a youth, Wang Xuehao studied with a grandson of Wang Yuanqi, who trained him in the elements that made the elder Wang’s manner so beloved: loose dotting, bold interplays of solid and void, and a studied awkwardness of line that somehow never departed from elegance. Wang Xuehao, like his mentors before him, was particularly interested in the fourteenth-century painter Huang Gongwang, whose manner he interprets here."
Tureen,"Chinese export porcelain was one of the luxuries deemed essential to a well-appointed eighteenth-century house. Until 1784, when direct trade began between China and America, Chinese porcelain came to the colonies by way of Europe. This tureen was part of a large service that descended in the Verplanck family of New York."
Tao_Yuanming_enjoying_chrysanthemums,"Du Jin, the son of an official, was a scholar and a poet, but after low placement in the metropolitan (jinshi) examination he decided to earn his living as a painter instead of pursuing a government career. Specializing in landscape and figural scenes in the Southern Song (1127–1279) academic manner, Du, like his younger contemporary Tang Yin (1470–1524), who befriended the painter in his old age, occupied an ambiguous position between scholar and professional artist.This painting portrays the poet Tao Qian (365–427) strolling through the mountains to admire the autumn flowers, some of which are held by his servant. Du's depiction combines a meticulous rendering of the figures with a dashing ink-wash treatment of the landscape.His poem reads:Along three paths he returned, at leisure with his bramble staff,The sun moved west over the yellow flowers and wattle fence.Realizing there was no way to revive the Jin [dynasty, 265–420],All he could do was become ""drunk as mud."""
Autumn_Harvest,"This fan painted during the war years reflects the poignancy that traditional subjects, such as flowers, butterflies and vegetables, acquire in times of distress. Ch'ien's inscription reads:The field and garden have goneuncultivated since the war.Where can we find enough food for thisyear of famine?I often think of the late autumns in thepeaceful past.The fragrant bean and luscious fruit werecheap.Ch'ien Sung-yen succeeded Fu Pao-shih as director of the Nanking Painting Academy."
Children_Studying,"Feng Zikai's intellectual development was fostered under the tutelage of the influential Buddhist scholar and painter Li Shutong (Hongyi). Later Feng studied in Japan, learning Western drawing and music. when he returned to China he answered the call for an art responsive to the needs of a broadly defined national culture, not with politically rhetorical pictures but with moving, humane depictions of common people in real situations, using a style based on woodblock illustration.In what might be called a ""20th century painting of scholars"", he depicts a group of children studying, thereby stating simply the prevailing hopes for education and literacy. In his inscription, he notes a universal truth:Homework is done betterIn the fresh air."
Zhou_Dunyi_admiring_lotus_flowers,"Xu Hao regularly painted subjects from popular literature, using a figure style based on Chen Hongshou. In this round fan, he brings down to earth the Song Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhou Dunyi (1017–73), author of the famous essay Admiring Lotus (1063).In this painting, Zhou Dunyi holds a fan like the one the shape of the pictures imitates. There is no mark along the centerline of the painting to indicate that the picture ever served as an actual fan, but the consonance of round forms in lotus leaves, fan and format is pleasing."
Camels,"Wu Zuoren's sympathetic portrayals of the lives of the peoples, animals, and landscapes of western China assured him political favor throughout the dangerous 1950s and 1960s. His favorite subjects—yaks, oxen, camels, and eagles—seem to embody the potent spirit of China's vast human and natural resources.Wu was a master of ink, controlling the flow of dilute washes across absorbent unsized paper and letting the wash create a line at the paper's edge. This spontaneous ink-wash style owed a debt to Qi Baishi (1864–1957), Wu's senior colleague at the Beijing Central Art Academy."
Mirror_with_symbols_of_the_four_cardinal_directions,"The four mythological creatures depicted on this mirror refer to symbols of the cardinal directions: the green dragon of the east, white tiger of the west, red bird of the south, and entwined black snake and tortoise of the north. These associations emerged in Chinese cosmology around the third century BCE and became firmly established in the following centuries. A long inscription encircling the animals, elegantly calligraphed in relief, illustrates a critical phase in the development of Chinese writing, when the regular script attained its standard form."
The_Scholar_Fu_Sheng_Transmitting_the_Book_of_Documents,"In his greatest act of infamy, the first emperor of Qin (Qin Shihuangdi) ruthlessly burned books and buried scholars alive to eliminate opposition. When the Han dynasty was established in 206 B.C., a program to reconstruct texts began. Fu Sheng retrieved a copy of the Book of Documents that he had hidden and spent the remainder of his days lecturing on it. Here Fu Sheng is shown discoursing on the text with the official Shao Zuo, who was sent by the emperor. Fu Sheng’s daughter, Fu Nu, seated beside him, was a scholar in her own right and aided by translating their local dialect into one familiar to the scribe.Du Jin was trained as a scholar but became a professional painter after failing the jinshi civil-service examination. He cultivated a circle of patrons and literati friends—including the artists Tang Yin and Shen Zhou—in Beijing, where he moved, as well as in Nanjing and Suzhou. Through these contacts Du Jin played a significant role in the development of a local professional painting style in Suzhou that was basically a refined version of the high academic style of the imperial court. Although this painting no longer bears a signature, it is a classic example of Du Jin’s polished academic manner."
Album_of_Blossoming_Plum,"The plum, the first flower to bloom in the spring, has long been admired by scholar-gentlemen for its fortitude in the face of harsh conditions. Its delicate blossoms, springing forth from gnarled trunks and twisted branches, are a symbol of renewal, while its fragrance carries connotations of moral purity and loyalty.Li Fangying developed a specialty for painting the blossoming plum, which he admired for its lofty symbolism and long association with scholar-painting, as well as for its viability as a vehicle for spontaneous, abbreviated brushwork and dramatic abstraction. This album, painted when Li was living at home mourning the death of his parents, exemplifies the artist's integration of poetry, painting, and calligraphy and shows off his distilled minimalism and ability to produce distinctive variations on a single theme.Born into a family of government officials in Nantong, Jiangsu Province, a district under the jurisdiction of Yangzhou, Li Fangying is traditionally identified as one of the ""Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou."" In 1729, in recognition of his father's loyal service, Li was granted an official post by the Yongzheng emperor (r. 1723–35). He held a number of posts as a magistrate in Shandong and Anhui Provinces, but his service was repeatedly interrupted due to clashes with his superiors."
"White_Crane_Mountain,_leaf_from_Album_for_Zhou_Lianggong","This painting and its accompanying inscription belonged to an album made for the noted Nanjing collector and high official Zhou Lianggong (1612–1672). A leading patron of contemporary artists, Zhou assembled a number of these albums during the last twenty-five years of his life, when his career required him to travel extensively. Such collaborative works have long been a means for a group of artists to commemorate special occasions, but Zhou’s albums, which sometimes encompassed hundreds of contributions, fulfilled a different function: they included works by professionals and scholar-amateurs, Ming loyalists and Qing officials, traditionalist orthodox painters and innovative individualists. By inviting a wide spectrum of artists to both view and contribute to these albums, Zhou created a unique forum for artists to learn from and appraise one another’s productions."
Scholar_on_a_rock,"Rendered in highly controlled contours of uniform width and geometric perfection that appear engraved rather than brushed, this fan painting is probably an early work exemplifying Ren Yi's mastery of the archaistic idiom of his fellow townsman Chen Hongshou (1598-1652), who was an important model for each of the Four Rens. Ren depicted a scholar, out for a stroll, resting on a large strangely eroded garden rock. The gentleman has propped his walking stick in a crook of the stone and become engrossed in a book. By isolating this image against a blank background, Ren focuses our attention on the subtle interplay between the scalloped contours of the rock and the patterned folds of the man's robes, conveying a sense of the deep harmony between these kindred spirits."
"Project_to_Extend_the_Great_Wall_of_China_by_10,000_Meters:_Project_for_Extraterrestrials_No._10","This album serves as a kind of blueprint, or proposal, for Cai’s eponymous 1993 project in which he laid a ten-thousand-meter trail of gunpowder from the western end of the Great Wall into the Gobi Desert and ignited it at dusk. It opens (on the right) with the eastern end of the Great Wall at Shanhaiguan. The multiple strands of the iconic structure are evoked by dynamic ink strokes and short, crenellated segments. Burn marks at the left end suggest Cai’s method for extending the length of the Great Wall. Here, he combines the force of his own gestures with the elemental force of ignited gunpowder, juxtaposing the controlled marks of his brush with the uncontrollable action of fire. Playing with the modern myth that the Great Wall is the only man-made construction visible from outer space, Cai’s pyrotechnic display of 1993, like this album, seeks to address a universal audience.To either side of the inked line, Cai has added cursive inscriptions that offer his musings on the project."
Lyric_Verse_by_Zhang_Yu_(1283–1350),"明 莫是龍 行書張雨曲 軸 紙本The fourth script type, semicursive, can be difficult to distinguish from cursive script, as they both emphasize speed and fluidity. In semicursive script, the brush is generally lifted between characters, though not always, and complex character forms are implified slightly, but less completely than in cursive. This example of semicursive text encapsulates the spirit of this script type: unhurried ease. During the late Ming dynasty (1568–1644), Mo Shilong was one of a group of artists working in Shanghai who achieved great heights of elegance in semicursive script. In this work, Mo transcribes a verse by the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) poet, painter, and calligrapher Zhang Yu, followed by a prose inscription relating the circumstances of the work’s creation. Mo had just returned home after failing the Provincial Examination in Nanjing in the winter of 1576. In disgrace and despair, he found serenity in Zhang Yu’s poem on the beauty of a simple life."
Doves,"This full-length portrait of a girl in ethnic costume is striking not only for its monumental size but also for the subtle characterization of her facial expression. Her cheerful gaze and coy smile, together with the dove motif, touchingly reveal the innocence of children.A Ge, a member of the Yi ethnic minority in Sichuan Province, entered the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts at age twelve as part of a program established to improve opportunities for women and minorities. Today she is one of the most celebrated printmakers in China."
Dictionary,"Shortly after finishing his monumental Ink Handscroll, Liu decided to try using watercolors for the first time, choosing a small family dictionary as his subject. Published circa 1937, the dictionary contained neither simplified characters nor Communist-inflected rhetoric. Liu’s Dictionary, therefore, can be read as a subtle commentary on how language influences the cultural identity and personal freedom of its users. Through meticulously creating effects that mimic the original object’s age and use, Liu insists on a microscopic way of looking—examining an ordinary object methodically and painstakingly, then using his art to transform it into something monumental."
Provisional_Landscapes,"This trio of images presents a gridlike expanse of low brick buildings that were perhaps old barracks, a power plant dominated by smokestacks and cooling towers, and new residential towers looming over naked trees and razed houses.Part of a large series recorded between 2002 and 2008, when Beijing was radically transformed in anticipation of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, these images vividly document the wholesale transformation of China’s landscape by juxtaposing modern structures with older buildings being demolished. These landscapes are “provisional” because they are in transition. Photographed in winter, the leafless trees, gray skies, and absence of people intensify the sense of stark desolation."
Scroll_B2,"Xing created her Scroll series in the summers of 1999 and 2000 while she was in Beijing in-between semesters at New York’s School of Visual Art. Scroll B2 features architectural elements of the Forbidden City and the alleys (hutong) of Beijing’s old residential neighborhoods. The juxtaposition of angles and silhouettes transforms the walls, rooflines, and gates into kaleidoscopic tapestries of abstract form. This composition, made from a single roll of film, consciously references both the cinematic filmstrip and the traditional handscroll format, creating a journey through shifting perspectives and changes in scale."
Herdboy_and_Buffalo,"Throughout his career Ren explored the expressive qualities of various brush manners. In the 1880s he was particularly interested in the effects of colored wash and loose, impressionistic brushwork, and created pictures such as this softly brushed fan. The Chan (Zen) theme of herding one's nature toward enlightenment, as a herdboy guides his wayward buffalo, derives from Song-dynasty illustrations."
"The_Qianlong_Emperor's_Southern_Inspection_Tour,_Scroll_Four:_The_Confluence_of_the_Huai_and_Yellow_Rivers","This oversize scroll is the fourth in a set of twelve commissioned by the Qianlong Emperor to document his first tour of southern China, made in 1751. The scroll portrays Qianlong inspecting flood-control measures along the Yellow River. He stands beside the spillway that directs the clear, blue waters of the Huai River into the silt-laden Yellow River, diluting its sediment content and helping to flush the silt out to sea. The remainder of the scroll depicts various flood-prevention techniques, including double-sluice gates to reduce the force and flow of water into the Grand Canal, pounded-earth and stone-faced levees, and large bundles of sorghum used for repairing breaches in the dikes.Painted by Xu Yang, whom Qianlong recruited for his painting academy while visiting Suzhou on his first southern tour, the scroll's ""Western-style"" unified panorama and automatically precise, theatrically posed figures reveal the influence of Giuseppe Castiglione (1688–1766) and other Jesuit artists working at the Qing court."
"Folding_fan_with_bamboo_frame_carved_with_bamboo_shoot,_squirrel_and_pine_tree","This folding fan features exquisite carvings on its outer ribs by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. This work showcase Jin’s sophisticated skill in relief carving. His carvings incorporate compositions from designs contributed by important modern artists, such as Jin Cheng (1878–1926) on this piece.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (fan frame #343), the bamboo carving was completed on March 21, 1946."
View_of_Lake_Tai,"Wen Zhengming painted this dreamy vision of Lake Tai, China's ""Great Lake,"" for a friend after their springtime boat ride together. Wen's poem reads:Islands spread out in a mirror,Like purple hibiscus immersed in a waterysilver platter.Who can hold thirty-thousand jing [thesupposed size of Lake Tai] in his bosom?I long to visit the seventy peaks [of Lake Tai]for myself.Heaven is vast, billows roll on, days turninto months.In the spring cold the water country hides fishand dragons;Sitting in the middle of the lake I seemed tohear roosters [crow] and dogs bark.Where should I find the retired statesmanFan Li?"
Squirrel_and_Grapes,"In Suzhou the Sha family owned a famous shop selling woodblock prints, which was destroyed by the Taiping occupation in 1860. Sha Fu found asylum in Shanghai and continued the family tradition of painting figures, particularly beautiful women, popularizing the genre in Shanghai.Artists like Sha Fu who made their living by selling paintings of popular subjects in the inexpensive fan format were no longer déclassé in Shanghai in the late 19th century. Fans were gifts often exchanged among friends, and a bourgeois clientele enjoyed the company of a favorite artist, regarding him as something of a celebrity."
Squirrel_and_Grape,"Liu Deliu's fan painted in a narrow inky range of colors portrays a squirrel precariously suspended between his goal, a succulent grape, and his curiosity about the intentions of an insect that has lighted on this object. The liveliness of this subject has obvious charm.In his inscription Liu says he is working in the style of Lu Shouping (Lu Zhi, 1496–1576), a Ming artist renowned for his sensitive observations transposed into ink sketches of flowers and birds. Using animation, subtle color and a decorative format, Liu transforms a subject of interest to scholar-artists since the Yuan into a popular image."
"Carved_fan,_chrysanthemum_and_bird","This folding fan features carvings on its outer ribs by Jin Xiya (1890–1979), the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. It showcases Jin’s virtuosic command of traditional bamboo intaglio carving. His works often incorporate compositions from designs contributed by his contemporary artists, such as the calligraphy in running script by Yang Jin (1876–1945) on this piece. In addition to the fine carving, this fan also bears birds and flowers by Jin himself—shedding light on the bamboo artist’s exquisite skill of painting.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (fan frame #40), the bamboo carving was completed on March 28, 1923."
Peony,"Uprooted during the turbulent years of the Taiping Rebellion, Ren Xiong, eldest of the Four Rens settled in Shanghai in his later years and became an influential painter of popular subjects: flowers and birds, sages and heroes.Ren's richly decorative fan is an interpretation of the 18th century ""boneless"" (ink without outline) style. Ren renders presence through the lush fullness of ink without painting an organically coherent plant; you will look in vain for a stem to support the heavy bud; it has a less cerebral appeal and evokes a real world of rooted plants, rough stone pots and contrasting textures."
Silkworm,"Ju Chao left Guangdong to serve as secretary to the official Zhang Jingxiu in Guangxi during the uprisings of the Taiping. After Zhang's retirement in 1856, Ju Chao and his cousin Ju Lian lived at Zhang's celebrated garden estate in Guangdong and taught painting to Zhang's young nephew. In his fifties, Ju Chao returned to his own villa and maintained a quiet life painting and studying Han seals.This tightly drawn depiction of silk moths and of silkworms on mulberry leaves reveals Ju Chao's playful and observant interest in unconventional subjects. He and his cousin were criticized by a contemporary Guangdong critic for choosing to paint such insignificant subjects as flies, fireflies, mosquitoes and ants. Zheng Qi, for instance, wrote:Certain artists only specialize in these to demonstrate their technical proficiency. How could they have taken such a crooked path; how can we discuss the principles of painting with them?"
A_Beauty,"Luo Hui's beautiful lady, like Qian Huian's is ""done in the style of Tang Yin"", but again there are only vague allusions to the 16th century artist's style. Deep, inky green and black and the touches of dark red at the lips and neckline suit the fashionable lady, chaste and yet seductive in her garden of banana and bamboo.Luo Hui was a student of Liu Deliu, and was a member of the Shanghai painting group ""The Nine Friends"", along with Gu Yun, Ren Yu, Jin Lan, Wu Dacheng, Ni Tian and Gu Linshi, all represented in this exhibition. He retired while still young to Suzhou where he continued to teach and enjoy the company of his friends."
The_Peach_and_Plum_Garden,"The painter has captured the pleasures of a gathering of friends in a garden on a spring night. A firefly lamp hangs from a branch to light the scrolls upon the table, and a servant boy brings a covered dish of cakes. At the far left, a member of the group is inspired to lift his cup in toast to the spring air.The figures, in a variety of three-dimensional poses comfortably occupy a complex landscape. Sha Fu uses powdered white pigment to pick out the blossoms and accented brushwork to enliven a traditional theme."
Water_Life,"This set of paintings—of the familiar creatures of the pond on one hand, and a studied evocation of the work of the seventeenth-century monk-artist Bada Shanren on the other—demonstrates the broad appeal of Qi Baishi's work. The sweeping tendrils and crusty shell of the shrimp, the structure of the crab, and the moist flesh of the frogs poised to spring are rendered with the greatest economy of means. The paper becomes the pond in which elemental life is stirred by the brush. This is the calligrapher's art at its best in painting."
Flowering_Plant,"Pu Ru, brother of the last emperor of China, Pu Yi, was the most talented painter among the princes of the Qing royal family. After the fall of the dynasty, Pu Ru took degrees in astronomy and biology in Berlin and then taught in the late 20s at the Imperial University in Tokyo. Returning to China, he taught at the National Art Academy in Peking, the art college within Peking University.Pu Ru never departed from the refined painting style acquired in his early training, but his paintings were nonetheless distinctive and original. This flower fan with its delicate, tightly controlled brushwork and pretty colors reveals his genteel sensibilities, as do the well-crafted poems in the old style, both of which refer to pure worlds of unsullied beauty."
Dongfang_Shou_as_a_Youth,"Shao Shaoyi was a student and friend of Qi Baishi. In the thirties and forties while working in Peking as a newspaper journalist, he was inspired by Qi's experiments using large brushes. Shao Shaoyi's painting of the official Dongfang Manqian who served the Han Emperor Wu Di and later assumed the rank of an Immortal, is a close copy of Qi's painting of the same subject. Shao, following Qi's lead, depicts the Immortal as a cherubic lad, still coiffed as a child, holding the colorful peach that is the emblem of this immortality like a favorite plaything. Qi in his inscription to Shao's painting gives himself credit for his novel decision to depict the Immortal as a youth."
Landscapes_of_the_Four_Seasons,"These two paintings belong to a set of enormous landscapes depicting the four seasons. They are all similarly composed, with large figures at the bottom and towering mountains above. Each season has its own narrative. In the springtime scene (right), two gentlemen on horseback cross a bridge with their servants. In the summer scene (left), travelers struggle against a strong wind, while a gentleman in a pavilion observes the storm.In his paintings Xie Shichen creates spaces that are poetic rather than representational, incorporating narrative vignettes and stylistic references to past masters. Here, he skillfully blends two distinct modes of painting. The first, favored by professional painters, is that of the Zhe School, which tended toward large-scale narrative subjects. The second is ascribed to the Wu School, whose calligraphic approach to landscapes was preferred by scholar-amateurs."
Landscape_in_the_style_of_Wang_Meng,"Zhu Angzhi inscribed this fan for the painter Shen Xuan, his contemporary, with one simple line: “After the brush-concept of Wang Meng’s [ca. 1308–1385] Clearing Dawn over Summer Mountains.” Had Zhu not written this, his friend would still have been able to identify the stylistic reference to the famous Yuan-dynasty painter thanks to the combination of two features: precarious leaning peaks and “hemp-fiber” strokes that provide a ropy texture. These elements were codified as essential to Wang Meng’s style as early as the Ming dynasty."
"Untitled_No._6_""Flower""","Liu gained prominence as a Cynical Realist figure painter in the 1990s, creating ironic, subtly morbid portrayals of political figures and military officials that reflect both his upbringing and a sense of disillusionment experienced after the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989. He later worked in a more abstract, expressive manner that incorporated landscape imagery, nudes, and writing. All of these themes come together in Liu’s Flower series, where one confronts an illogical swarm of disparate media, subjects, and styles. Painted over the landscape scenes in semiopaque colors are large-scale pink flowers, phallic forms, grotesque naked figures drawn with “hairy” modeling lines, and ambiguously irreverent references to earlier masters. Crudely written words are added as gratuitous captions or comments alongside squiggles and doodles. The sexually charged imagery seems to suggest a darker realm of carnal passions that only contemporary art has been able to confront."
Landscapes_after_old_masters,"These eight album leaves show Huang Jun engaging with the styles of a diverse group of painters, from Zhao Boju of the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279) to Wu Li of the Qing dynasty. By Huang’s time, artists felt increasingly free to build idiosyncratic canons in old master albums, as seen here."
Figures,"The 19th century interest in a dramatic figural style, cultivated by populist artists, celebrating heroes, sages and religious figures, was fueled in the 20th century by the heroics of a nation in crisis and the continuing democratization of culture.Xu Cao was a leading conservative artist in Peking in the 30s and 40s. He took his inspiration for this handscroll from a painting of Drunken Immortals by the 15th century artist Du Jin, known for his large figures, sometimes over a foot high, wielding torches, thunderbolts and the like. Some 15th century critics thought these figures ""strange indeed, lacking what is called elegant beauty."" In the Peking of the 1930s, Xu Cao's zestful brushwork and taste for theatrics exemplified in the attitudes of his figures, were conservative in their references to the past, but wholly modern in the spirit of defiance and abandon they celebrated. Among the riches of China's artistic tradition are innumerable ghosts ready to take new life in the present.Xu Cao, who served as vice-president of the Peking Painting Academy was charged as a rightist in 1957, disappeared and later died."
Landscapes_and_calligraphy,"Passing the local-level civil-service examination in 1727, Gao Fenghan served as a petty bureaucrat in Anhui Province for about a decade. Then, in 1737, Gao not only lost his government position but his right hand suddenly became paralyzed from acute rheumatism. Painfully training himself to write and paint with his left hand, he came to prize the crude awkwardness of his left-handed brushwork—a quality he had been unable to attain with his right hand. Supporting himself through his painting, he moved to a Buddhist monastery in Yangzhou, where he became close friends with the eclectic group of artists known as the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou. In 1741 he left Yangzhou and retired to his hometown in Shandong Province.This small album, dated 1736, was done one year before Gao lost the use of his right hand. It shows the artist already working in a highly individualistic, naive style that reflects, in part, his lack of contact with ancient masterpieces. In contrast to Orthodox School painters, who drew inspiration from the works of Song and Yuan scholar-artists, Gao reveals in his inscriptions his artistic debt to near-contemporary professional painters such as Lan Ying (1585–after 1664), Gong Xian (1619?–1689), and Dai Benxiao (1621–1698)."
Dragon_pine,"Wu Boli, a Daoist priest at the Shangqing (""Upper Purity"") Temple on Dragon Tiger Mountain, Jiangxi Province, was a close folower of Fang Congyi (ca. 1301–ca. 1392). Dragon Pine was painted for Zhang Yuchu, the forty-third Daoist ""pope"" of the Orthodox Unity sect, and bears his appreciative colophon.This animated pine recalls an account by the tenth-century hermit-painter Jing Hao that describes ""a gigantic pine tree, its aged bark overgrown with lichen, its winged scales seeming to ride in the air. Its stature is like that of a coiling dragon trying to reach the Milky Way."" For Jing Hao, as for later artists, the pine signified ""the moral character of the virtuous man."" Here, the tree may also represent the Daoist sage, or ""perfected being."" According to Daoist geomantic beliefs, vital energies collect at the base of a mountain slope along the edge of a stream-precisely the location of the pine in Wu Boli's painting."
"Flowers,_fish,_and_crabs","This painting by the court master Liu Jie juxtaposes a large perch with many smaller fish and a variety of flora and fauna, including narcissus in bloom, lily pads, grasses, grain, a crab, and frogs. The effect is one of civilized tranquility in which the large fish, symbolizing a person of obvious stature, swims quietly along a peaceful riverbank. Both the fish and grain symbolize wealth, and the overall impact of the image is suggestive of abundance and reward. Some pictorial elements—perch, grain, and crab—also create a visual pun with a homophonous wish for “peace and harmony in the entire palace,” which makes it clear that this picture was intended for the emperor.Liu Jie’s formal signature, which gives his title as Commander in the Embroidered Uniform Guard, on Appointment to the Wenhua Palace, confirms that this was an imperial commission. The Wenhua Palace was one of the halls in the Forbidden City at which court painters served. Liu’s rank of commander was very near the highest to which a painter could aspire. Both Liu’s grandfather and father had also held this title as court artists, and Liu Jie would have been entitled to inherit this rank after his father’s death, which apparently occurred only a few years after Liu received his first court title in 1477."
Landscapes,"Following the fall of Beijing to the bandit-rebel Li Zicheng in April 1644, Nanjing suffered a chaotic year of warfare between a Ming loyalist regime and the attacking Manchu forces. This album was painted in August 1644 as the Ming dynasty was crumbling.In creating these idyllic images of the world of the recluse, Zhang Feng turned to the pale dry style of Ni Zan (1306–1374), but the gossamer lightness of Zhang's touch adds a new lyrical charm to Ni's style. Keenly interested in language, Zhang explores the expressive interplay of visual and poetic imagery in fresh and insightful ways: one leaf describes the murmur of pines and the sound of water running over rocks; another evokes the echoes of a stone tossed into a deserted valley; a third features a sunset, a subject rarely depicted by scholar-artists but one that may have held deep symbolic meaning for Zhang. He remained loyal to the Ming dynasty after the Manchu conquest and, refusing to take an official position under the new regime, ended his life in poverty."
Page_from_the_Mustard_Seed_Garden_Manual_of_Painting,"In 1679, publishers Shen Xinyu and Li Yu printed the first edition of the Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting. Produced in five volumes, it included sections on technique, trees, rocks, figures, and reproductions of works by famous painters. Nanjing painter Wang Gai was chosen to illustrate the book, and he did so by adapting a painting primer from an earlier artist. For an aspiring painter without access to a collection of their own, the Mustard Seed Manual and others like it were invaluable resources, as they offered a glimpse into the elite training available to painters of privilege. While numerous painting manuals found favor in China, Korea, and Japan, none had so great an impact as the Mustard Seed Manual, which was widely reproduced and disseminated."
Spring_Landscape,"Gong Xian was interested in art theories and methods. He composed a few illustrated books for students of painting with practical instructions on structure and brushwork. He singled out stability (an) and strangeness (qi) as key to landscape composition by stating, “If a composition has no strangeness, there is no value in its stability. Stability without strangeness is the work of a commonplace hand; strangeness without stability, of an immature hand.” An ideal painting, such as this landscape, should have strange imagery to stimulate the viewer’s imagination beyond the mundane world yet be convincing enough to stir his yearning for accessibility.Gong complements this evocative landscape of bizarre rock masses and empty dwellings under lush trees with a melancholy poem:Green willows, fresh cattails, an expanse of water inthe wilderness;Reflections of red balustrades around the pavilionsof private homes.Having seen the spring off, I still call for wine,In a rainy chill that the setting sun cannot dispel.cat. no. 54"
Vista_into_the_Distance,"Zha Shibiao, an Anhui native, was descended from a family with a sizable collection of antiquities, including Song and Yuan paintings. Uninterested in civil service, he supported himself through painting and calligraphy while traveling in the lower Yangzi region before settling down in Yangzhou by the late 1660s.Early exposure to a broad range of painting models enabled Zha to break free of the stylistic dominance of Hongren (1610–1664), with whom he was personally acquainted. Here, Zha evokes the exquisite simplicity of Hongren’s principal model, Ni Zan (1306–1374). Adopting Ni’s typical composition—a wide river separating foreground trees from distant mountains—Zha’s addition of rich vegetation and a human figure transforms Ni’s austere style, creating an inviting environment for reclusion as described in Zha’s poetic inscription.cat. no. 48"

Mending_clothes_by_daylight,"Chan doctrine teaches that all images are illusory, and paintings such as this one, in which ink is applied so lightly that the picture seems to flicker and fade before the viewer’s eyes, are among the most eloquent artistic manifestations of that belief. Using dilute ink for most of the picture, the artist has reserved dark tones for the eyes of the main figure and the needle in his hand, imparting special emphasis to these key elements. The painting is inscribed by the prominent Chan abbot Chijue Daochong. His poem reads:Mending rips and tears—robe mostly tattered,It’s like chasing clouds—where to begin?The needle glints in the rays of the setting sun,Yet one must still squint."

Portrait_of_Huang_Jianyuan_(1844–1911),"A gentleman in a robe of blue silk gazes out at the viewer, a yellow chrysanthemum clutched delicately in his left hand. In the foreground, a plant of blossoming chrysanthemum clusters next to a gnarled rock, while in the background more flowers grow at the base of a parasol tree, which arcs gently above the scholar, framing him in the center of the picture. The subject is Huang Jianyuan (1844–1911), a late Qing scholar-official. The painter of the portrait itself did not sign the work; the inscription is by Huang’s friend Ding Shangyong (active late 19th century), a scholar-official and painter who added the landscape background. The deep shading of the face likely reflects the portrait painter’s knowledge of photography, which was introduced to China in the 1860s."
Bodhisattva_Mahapratisara_with_the_Text_of_“Da_Sui_qiu_tuoluoni”,"This ritual print shows a dharani, or mystic formula, written in Sanskrit around the central figure of the Bodhisattva Mahapratisara. His eight arms hold different attributes reflecting his protective powers. The design is reminiscent of a mandala, a symbolic representation of the universe. The text relates the benefits of making copies of it so as to motivate multiple printings.The lotus medallions along the borders have been overprinted with Sanskrit “seed” characters seemingly carved on another block of the same size. This would make the work the earliest known example of multiblock printing. The donor, Li Zhishun, and the carver, Wang Wenzhao, are named near the top."
Poem_in_Cursive_Script,"One of the most outspoken officials in the late Ming period, Huang Daozhou persistently risked his life and career by criticizing court authorities. After the Manchu conquest of north China, he was active in the revivalist movement under the Southern Ming regime and died a martyr.Huang was an eminent scholar on a variety of subjects, from Neo-Confucianism to astronomy. Although he considered calligraphy a mere pastime, his accomplishment is no less impressive. In this work of running-cursive script, he altered the standard configuration of characters to create precariously balanced forms that often rely on a calculated final stroke to adjust their proportion and center of gravity. The sharp, fastmoving brushwork generates a rhythmic cadence of pent-up energy and release.Huang composed this poem during an outing to the mountains by West Lake, in Hangzhou, in the winter of 1638. In it he laments the physical frailty of old age and expresses his longing for a life in reclusion. Among his companions on this trip was Ni Yuanlu (1593–1644).cat. no. 9"
Landscapes_in_the_style_of_Ni_Zan,"Witnessing his father’s death after a failed attempt to resist the Manchus, Dai Benxiao harbored strong loyalist sentiments well into adulthood. His spare painting, constructed with dry contours and minimal shading, evokes a cool otherworldliness that suggests emotional detachment in the wake of dynastic and family tragedy.According to Dai’s inscription, this painting is a copy from memory of a landscape by the recluse-artist Ni Zan (1306–1374). Ni typically reduces nature to its barest essentials in calligraphic brushstrokes, an aesthetic that Dai adapted here into complex rock formations rendered in the “dry-brush” style. In his inscription he compares this work to a set of ten paintings by Ni that celebrate the exuberance of nature through dense compositions and vigorous brush idioms. Emphasizing the dynamic aspect of Ni’s art, he suspected most of the overly sketchy works attributed to Ni to be forgeries.cat. no. 57"
Orchids_and_Rock,"A native of Suzhou, Xu Fang passed the provincial-level civil-service examination in 1642. After his father committed suicide to protest Manchu rule, Xu gave up his pursuit of public office and spent the rest of his life in self-exile on a mountain outside Suzhou.This painting of wild orchids, fungi, and a rock can be considered a symbolic self-portrait of the artist. Orchids thrive in the wilderness, unconcerned with the bustling world that ignores their fragrance. Time may carve into the rock’s surface and chisel away its edges but cannot compromise its essential substance. Painted in late winter one year before he died, the robust fungi, treasured for their association with longevity, tell of the old man’s high spirits and optimism.cat. no. 58"
Streams_and_Mountains_without_End,"A close friend and follower of Dong Qichang (1555–1636), Zhao Zuo is said to have served occasionally as Dong's ""substitute brush,"" or ghost painter. In this scroll, however, Zhao has followed the manner of the Yuan master Huang Gongwang (1269–1354) to create a lyrically realistic landscape in which Dong Qichang's influence is tempered by the deft use of rich washes and color. Abstract mountain forms, no doubt inspired by Dong, are softened by the painter's skillful evocation of spatial recession and hazy atmosphere. It is precisely the ""professional"" technical excellence and ""sweetness"" that distinguish Zhao's imitations from Dong's authentic works."

Deep within a nesting set of walls is a small set of rustic buildings, where stools and a couch await cultivated visitors."
Writing_the_“Orchid_Pavilion_Preface”_One_Thousand_Times,"This photographic documentation of Qiu’s best-known, process-driven work exemplifies his early interest in the performative aspect of calligraphy, particularly the pedagogical method of repeatedly copying a model until its brush movements become second nature. The “Orchid Pavilion Preface,” written by the patriarch of calligraphy Wang Xizhi (303–61), has long been revered as the unsurpassed model of cursive writing. Repeatedly writing over his free-hand interpretation of the original, Qiu turns the paper into a saturated black field. By focusing on the process of writing rather than its literary content, Qiu asserts that the ultimate goal of calligraphic practice is “a form of ‘written meditation’.”"
"Landscape_after_Xia_Gui_(active_ca._1195–1230),_from_the_Mustard_Seed_Garden_Manual_of_Painting","In 1679, the playwright, author, and garden designer Li Yu published a primer for amateur painters called the Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting. The manual’s images and texts impart a sense of famous masters’ styles and how to reproduce them. The designs for the prints were prepared by Wang Gai, as he had the versatility required to paint in a range of manners. The manual was extremely successful and became the most widely used book of its type not only in China, but in Japan and Korea as well. Today, many painters still use it as a starting point."
"Hibiscus,_Lotus,_and_Rock","Recalling a beautiful woman in their blushing colors and delicate shapes, the blossoms of the lotus and hibiscus epitomize the exuberance and fullness of youth. Seeming to mock himself for continuing to admire such lush summer flowers, the aging Shitao inscribed the lines by the renowned Song dynasty poet Su Shi (1036–1101): “As I grow older, I have stopped having lush dreams, Even one hibiscus tree by the pond is too much for me.”Suffering from the infirmities of old age, Shitao, in the last years of his life, frequently painted in a broad impressionistic style with rich wet ink. As he wistfully suggests in his inscription, painting in such an obviously sensuous manner was perhaps not entirely appropriate for one of his age."

It also includes two volumes of landscapes in the styles of old masters, which show readers how to transform what they have learned into their own historically minded compositions.The manual transmitted the fashion for studying old masters' styles beyond the rarified elite circles that had given rise to the practice, and it went on to become the most widely used introduction to painting not only in China, but in Korea and Japan as well. Subsequent editions added flowers as a subject and expanded sections on human figures. It remains in use today across the world."
"Mountain_Retreat,__leaf_from_Album_for_Zhou_Lianggong","This painting and its accompanying inscription belonged to an album made for the noted Nanjing collector and high official Zhou Lianggong (1612–1672). A leading patron of contemporary artists, Zhou assembled a number of these albums during the last twenty-five years of his life, when his career required him to travel extensively. Such collaborative works have long been a means for a group of artists to commemorate special occasions, but Zhou’s albums, which sometimes encompassed hundreds of contributions, fulfilled a different function: they included works by professionals and scholar-amateurs, Ming loyalists and Qing officials, traditionalist orthodox painters and innovative individualists. By inviting a wide spectrum of artists to both view and contribute to these albums, Zhou created a unique forum for artists to learn from and appraise one another’s productions."
Qin,"Many Ming-dynasty princes, starting with the sons of the founder and continuing until the last generation before the dynasty's fall in the mid-seventeenth century, were accomplished musicians, and some made important contributions to musicology and musical theory. The first prince of Lu (1568–1614), brother of Emperor Shenzhong (Wanli), was an immensely rich man, and hundreds of qin were made for his household and descendants in the last years of the Ming dynasty. All bear the inscription of the Princedom of Lu, and all are numbered. About ten Prince Lu qin are extant; the one in the Metropolitan Museum, number 18, dated 1634, is the earliest. The highest-numbered Prince Lu qin known is number 295. It is dated 1644, the year the Ming dynasty came to an end.The back of the Metropolitan's qin bears the maker's seal and date, the words ""Capital Peace,"" and a twenty-character poem by Jingyi Zhuren (d. 1670) that reads:The moonlight is being reflected by the river YangziA light breeze is blowing over clear dewdrops,Only in a tranquil placeCan one comprehend the feeling of eternity."
Mi_Fu_Bowing_to_a_Stone,"The world changed around Pu Ru,brother of the last emperor of China, Pu Yi, and the most talented painter among the princes of the Qing royal family,but his values remained constant. In his painting of Mi Fu (1052–1107), the Northern Song poet, politician, painter, and connoisseur, Pu pays homage to the enduring culture of China's lettered gentlemen. The magistrate Mi Fu was known as much for his outspokenness as for his refined tastes. Pu's painting recalls Mi's visit to the garden of the governor of Wuwei (present-day Anhui), where he saw a stone of uncommon presence and wonder. To pay his respects, Mi dressed in official robes, carried his hu (an official tablet used to ensure that a lesser man's breath never fell upon the emperor), and addressed the stone as ""Elder Brother Rock."" Others found this laughable, but Mi answered that he bowed to the stone; he did not worship it.In Pu Ru's painting, we see Mi Fu bowing, but there is no stone. With the classic means of the literati repertory,restraint and omission,Pu Ru evokes complex resonances. Garden stones were prized as human character was prized. Their idiosyncratic features were admired, their companionship was valued, and their challenge to the viewer's imagination was esteemed. Pu's painting clearly intimates that the beauty and stature of such stones exist primarily in the mind of the beholder and that these qualities might be preserved there, even after the stone,like the Qing dynasty,has vanished."
Remonstrating_with_the_emperor,"Depicting a loyal official remonstrating with the emperor, this painting was commissioned to enhance the image of the sovereign as a just ruler who welcomed frank criticism and encouraged honest admonitions from his officials. The reality was often quite the opposite.Bearing the signature of Liu Jun, a court painter who eventually attained the honorary rank of Commander in Chief of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, this large colorful hanging scroll testifies to the continuation of the Song academic tradition of narrative art under the sponsorship of the Ming court. But while both the subject matter and figure style are based on Song models, Remonstrating with the Emperor exhibits a compositional density and schematization that typify works of the Ming academy at the end of the fifteenth century. Song court paintings emphasize narrative content and the creation of a believable spatial framework for the action; Ming paintings emphasize symbolic content. Liu Jun's main objective is no longer the recounting of a specific story or the achievement of an accurate description of nature; rather, it is the communication of a message through a vocabulary of images imbued with symbolic meaning."
"Evening_Bell_from_a_Mist-Enshrouded_Temple,_from_Eight_Views_of_Xiao_and_Xiang","In the late eleventh century, a scholar-official named Song Di made eight paintings based on the scenery of the Xiao and Xiang River region in Hunan. Paired with poetic titles that emphasized the melancholy of the misty landscapes, the Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang was a carefully encoded protest against the political climate of the day, in which officials faced the constant threat of exile if they crossed the emperor or his favored officials.Over the years, the Eight Views became a common theme in landscape painting, not only in China but in Japan and Korea as well. By Liu Yanchong’s time, it was one of many canonical landscape themes and the choice to paint it was not necessarily politically charged."
"Landscape_after_Dong_Yuan,_Juran,_Ma_Yuan,_and_Xia_Gui","This landscape of swirling, fantastic mountains has puzzled scholars. The painting is signed “Li Zai of Putian,” a painter who lived during the fifteenth century, but its style clearly places it in the seventeenth century or later. Also, the artist’s inscription mentions the sixteenth-century collector Xiang Yuanbian, so it was obviously not intended to be a forgery of the fifteenth-century Li Zai, but the possibility of another painter by that name from the same hometown is unlikely. Whoever this Li Zai was, he was daring: as he states in the inscription, this painting is an attempt to combine the disparate styles of several old masters—Dong Yuan and Juran of the tenth century and Ma Yuan and Xia Gui of the thirteenth—and the results are fresh and unusual."
Lotus,"Chen Hengke's masterpiece of design demonstrates the shift in the modern period away from calligraphic to graphic principles. Chen's painting frankly recalls Wu Changshi's numerous renderings of this subject, but strays from the firm, round brushwork that was the underpinning of Wu's work. Chen's dramatic composition groups the contrasting shapes into right angles along two edges of the picture, creating a tension that makes the unused space come alive. Trained in calligraphy since his youth and something of a prodigy, Chen demonstrates in his inscription the power of his calligraphic line to activate a three-dimensional space. Ultimately however, his inscription is subordinated to the surface design."
Flower_and_Rock,"Zeng Xi says in his inscription that this painting was inspired by Li Shan (Li Futang, 1686–after 1760). One has only to look at the painting by Ren Xiong at the beginning of this exhibition, also said to be done in the style of Li Shan, to recognize that style is in the brush of the beholder.Zeng's intense frenzy of brushwork wonderfully conveys the earth's force stored in the old rock."
On_the_Seventeenth_Day,"Most personal correspondence was written in an informal form of clerical script known as cursive clerical (caoli) or draft cursive (zhangcao). In this script type, which originated as an abbreviated form of writing used in drafting manuscripts, individual characters are simplified, with some brushstrokes omitted and others linked in fluid, continuous lines. By the fourth century, such informal writings by known authors, originally viewed as a heterodox debasement of the orthodox clerical manner, became cherished for their expressive individuality.Original manuscripts by the ""calligraphy sage"" Wang Xizhi and other early masters were already rare in the early Tang dynasty (618-907), when a major effort to collect and authenticate Wang's writings was sponsored by the imperial court. To preserve and propagate these precious writing models, precise tracings were made, as were stone or wood-carved reproductions. Rubbings taken from the carved reproductions provided the principal means for students to acquire and study classical models.On the Seventeenth Day is a selection of twenty-nine letters written by Wang Xizhi collected under the sponsorship of the Tang emperor Taizong (r. 627-49), a devoted student of Wang's writing style and the compiler of a comprehensive collection of Wang's surviving works. The title derives from the initial characters of the first letter. Extant rubbings of the manuscript date to the Song dynasty (960-1279) or later and vary tremendously in quality. The Song rubbings, of which several versions are known, were based in turn on Tang tracings or rubbings. The dominant type, such as this example, ends with the large imperial cipher qi (""imperial order"") followed by a brief inscription stating that the emperor ordered the copy carved on stone as the official version of the Hongwen Academy."
Letters_to_Fang_Shiguan,"The tradition of collecting personal letters dates back nearly two millennia in China. It was believed that the intimate space of the letter encouraged a sense of freedom and openness in calligraphers, and the resulting calligraphy was often treasured as a true expression of the artist’s spirit. This album is a collection of letters written by the great painter and calligrapher Zhu Da to his close friend Fang Shiguan (1650–ca. 1711). Fang must have saved them as treasured traces of a friend and gifted artist. At some point, they were mounted together as an album. The letters concern four areas of Zhu’s life: his health; meetings with Fang; exchanges of favors and small gifts; and painting, including both the viewing of other artists’ works and the selling of his own."
"Landscapes,_Flowers_and_Birds","Xiang Shengmo enjoyed two significant advantages in his early years as a painter. First, his grandfather Xiang Yuanbian possessed the greatest collection of old masterworks in the realm. Second, Dong Qichang, whose theories were so influential in seventeenth-century art circles, served for a period of time as a tutor in his home, and Xiang maintained a friendship with the elder painter. With this unusual background, Xiang achieved an exceptional range, as is evident from this diverse album of landscape and flower subjects."
Birds_and_Flowers_of_the_Four_Seasons,"Qi Baishi painted this set of hanging scrolls in 1920, combining seasonal bird-and-flower motifs with rebuses to evoke auspicious meanings."
"“Bamboo”_section,_from_the_Mustard_Seed_Garden_Manual_of_Painting",This is a later Japanese reprint of one of the most famous drawing manuals in East Asian history.
Landscapes_with_Poems,"In this album of painting and poetry, made one year before his death, Gong Xian exhibits a luminous self-confidence and contentment. The hermit's favorite haunts in and around Nanjing are compared to the abodes of the immortals. As an art teacher and the author of several manuals on painting, Gong perfected an ink-wash and dotting technique that enabled him to achieve both incredible density and translucency. In these remarkable works, Gong attains new heights in painting simultaneously with words and images."
Landscape_Sketches_of_Mount_Luofu,"During a 1957 trip to Guangdong province in southern China, Xie visited Mount Luofu, a famous site in the region known for its spectacular landscape. He may have made these rudimentary sketches from nature while on the road, reducing key topographical features to concise compositions of confident lines."
Opera_Figures,Guan Liang studied oil painting in Tokyo in 1918. After his return to China in 1923 he concentrated on traditional styles and mural painting. His colorful drawings of opera figures are now much imitated by contemporary painters.
Six_Horses,"The disparities in paper, pigment, and style between the two halves of this painting make it clear that they are by different hands and from different periods. In the first half of the painting, the horses and figures are well drawn and there is a rough vigor in the depiction of the landscape and trees. The shading of the land forms and the bold modulated outlines defining the figures, who wear typical Khitan costumes, most closely resemble murals done in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in north China, then ruled by the Khitan Liao dynasty (907–1125). In the second half, the unmodulated, ""iron-wire"" lines used to describe the drapery folds of the rider, the heavy outline of the rock, and the dry calligraphic texture of the tree suggest a fourteenth-century date."
Orchid,"Orchids are an emblem of quiet, even hidden virtue, and a subject well suited to rendering in ink alone. Wu's muted palette is elegant and understated, but enough color is used to satisfy turn-of-the-century taste."
"Sparrows,_plum_blossoms,_and_bamboo","The appeal of Southern Song academic flower and bird painting, exemplified here, derives from careful realism; studied, selective presentation; and genuine affection lavished upon the small and colorful things of the garden."
"Master_Cheng’s_Admonition_on_Seeing,_Hearing,_Words,_and_Deeds","清 鄧石如 隷書程子視聽言動之箴 四條屏 紙本In his final years, Deng Shiru’s clerical script took on the character you see here, with thick powerful lines of almost unvarying thickness. This work, made the year Deng died, is a transcription of an eleventh-century text by the Neo-Confucian Cheng Yi (1033–1107)."
Landscape_in_the_manner_of_Wang_Meng,"The densely stacked and swirling mountain forms of this painting evoke Wang Meng, the fourteenth-century artist. Though this work is unsigned, it is close to the style of the sixteenth-century painter Wen Boren, who revered Wang Meng and made many paintings in his manner"
"Landscape_Sketches_of_Mt._Danxia,_Guangdong","In 1963 Xie held a painting exhibition in Guangdong. While there, he visited Mount Danxia, a scenic site celebrated for the reddish surface of its cliffs. He made quite a few pencil sketches of the scenery on coarse paper of varying sizes, and he identified the motifs he used by writing single words and simple phrases onto the sketches. Despite their brevity, the captions vividly capture the extraordinary variety of the natural landscape."
Landscape,Jin Cheng's commitment to traditional values in painting is evident in this fan in his recollection of the style of the tenth century landscape master Dong Yuan.
Landscapes_after_old_masters,"By the late nineteenth century, when the little-known painter Du Xiang made this album, artists had been engaging with the same old-master styles for centuries, and the possibilities for an original contribution appeared to be running out. Nevertheless, Du persisted, creating something fresh and new by magnifying manners and exaggerating forms. See, for instance, the second leaf, in which the tenth-century artist Li Cheng’s classic composition of twin pines backed by mountains has been rendered as a tipsy, whimsical fantasia of lines unlike anything seen before or since."
Crane_in_a_bamboo_grove,"A favorite image in Chinese society and a familiar presence in imperial gardens as well as refined scholarly retreats, cranes were also renowned as the vehicles of Daoist immortals. Their long life span and loyalty to a single mate made them symbols of longevity and faithfulness. Here, a Manchurian crane, identified by its distinctive red forehead, strolls through a corner of the palace garden. Stopping in midstride and turning its head, the bird has just been startled by a branch of bamboo that has brushed against its tail feathers.One of only a handful of such large-scale images of birds to survive from the late Yuan or early Ming dynasty, this painting derives its subject from a composition by the emperor Huizong (r. 1100–25), who painted a set of six cranes in different poses. The complex branch structure of the twisting bamboo and the intricate detail of the bird's plumage—with every filament of the feathers carefully delineated—reveal a level of naturalistic description that predates the more conventionalized images of cranes created by the Ming court painter Bian Wenjin (ca. 1354–1428)."
Stele_on_Ritual_Implements,"何紹基 隸書 禮器碑 軸 紙本This work is a direct homage to an early stone inscription, known as the “Stele on Ritual Implements” (Liqi bei), written in A.D. 156, that was considered by many Epigraphic School calligraphers to be the greatest ancient example of this script type. Here, the scholar-calligrapher He Shaoji transcribes a portion of this stele, enlarging the characters and spreading them over six scrolls to create an impressive work of art for a large, public setting. The “Stele on Ritual Implements” was one of He Shaoji’s favorite inscriptions, and when he wrote this at the age of seventy-one, he probably knew the text so well that he did not need to consult the original."
Couplet,"清 鄧石如 隷書 對聯 絹本This work, written just a year before Deng Shiru’s death, encapsulates the appeal of his mature clerical script, which is typified by squat characters written in unwavering lines. Pairs of hanging scrolls like these—known as couplets (duilian)—were often hung in reception halls for special occasions. The sentiment of the poem (translated and transcribed below) is perfect for a festive celebration.Right: The heart is a good field—plow it for a hundredgenerations, and it will never be depleted.Left: Goodness is a perfect treasure—use it for a lifetime,and some will still remain.心作良田百世耕之不盡善為至寶一生用則有餘"
"Epitaph_for_Wang_Jihuan_and_his_Wife,_Madame_Min","明 董其昌 行書汪繼環墓志銘 卷 紙本Dong Qichang composed and transcribed this epitaph for a couple—Wang Jihuan (Wang Chengxu, 1559–1611) and his wife, Madame Min (1558–1622)—at their son’s request. The Wangs were cultured merchants from Anhui Province who made their fortune primarily in the salt trade. As is typical of a formal epitaph, the text tells the life stories of the deceased and extols their virtues in highly stylized language. Commissioning such a text, particularly from a famous scholar and calligrapher like Dong Qichang, was a way for children to honor their parents. Dong uses semicursive script, which is also found in informal writing, but the airy regularity of the lines and the stable construction of his characters invest the work with a sense of gravitas."
Poem_on_Climbing_Mt._Qile,"明 黃輝 草書登栖樂山詩 卷 紙本Huang Hui, a close friend and colleague of Dong Qichang (1555–1636), is best known for his poetry, but his calligraphy was considered equal to Dong’s by many of their contemporaries. Whereas Dong followed the rules of the classical tradition, Huang struck out in search of an individualist voice. In this work, Huang transcribes two poems about his experience climbing Mt. Qile near his hometown in Sichuan Province. Relying on the movements of the wrist rather than the fingers, he created a vigorous, expressive style. The characters are squat and compact, which imparts a sense of blunt power to the writing."
Couplet,"清 鄧石如 隷書 對聯 絹本The blocky script type you see here is called clerical script, which evolved as a more efficient alternative to seal script. In clerical script, the complicated structures and twisting lines of seal script are simplified to more manageable forms, written with lines of varying thickness that allow the calligrapher to move the brush more quickly. These changes incidentally meant that calligraphers could inject more individuality into their writing. Though clerical script fell out of common use by the third century, it was revived in the eighteenth century, when scholars like Deng Shiru began to look to the distant past for inspiration.Poets exchange verses, seeking lasting celebration.Even as the flowers wither, ewers and wine goblets extend eternal harmony.吟壇贈答追長慶華謝壺觴繼永和"
On_Calligraphy,"明 張瑞圖 行書書評十二條屏 絹本In this set of twelve scrolls, Zhang Ruitu transcribes a commentary on twenty-five calligraphers composed by Yuan Ang (461–540), an artist and minister at the court of the Liang dynasty (r. 502–57), where both literary and art criticism first flourished in China. While some of the calligraphers discussed, like Wang Xizhi (ca. 303–ca. 361) and Wang Xianzhi (344–386), are towering figures in art history, many of them are unknown today. Zhang writes in a forceful style marked by sharp angles and characters that are taller than they are wide."
Inscription_on_Stone_Sails,"清 趙之謙 楷書 石颿銘 四條屏 紙本In a sense, the Epigraphic School culminated with Zhao Zhiqian. His standard script, which you see here, was inspired by stone inscriptions of the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534), but he wrote with a quivering brush that gives his calligraphy a quality of pulsating power. The transcribed text is part of Bao Zhao’s (ca. 412–466) poem “Inscription on Stone Sails.” “Stone Sails” refers to a mountain in Hunan Province, named for its many steep, pointed peaks that resemble the sails of a fleet of ships. The text reads:Filling the sky to its limits is a shadowy expanse[of clouds].Cloud banners have not risen; no wind rustles throughthe branches.Breakers splash like collapsing hills, as dark wavesthunder along.—Trans. by Shi-yee Liu"
Blossoming_Plum,"A poet, calligrapher, and painter as well as a student of astronomy, geography, and music, Tang Yifen was renowned for his paintings of plum blossoms. According to his inscription, these four paintings were originally part of a twelve-leaf album inspired by the Yangzhou eccentric and master plum painter Jin Nong (1687–1763)."
Landscape_and_Figure,"Wu writes in his inscription on this fan that the landscape was done in the style of Hua Yen (1682–ca 1765), but the loose impressionistic brushwork belongs to the style first popular in Shanghai. Wu worked in Peking, but the Shanghai style was no longer a local phenomenon by his generation. The era of reproductions and easy travel freed artists from the limitations of regional schools."
Spathyphyllum,"In Japan from 1902–1909, Chen saw an indigenous culture discarded in the pursuit of material advantages from the West. He was determined that China would not follow this course. Paintings like this one, with its simplified shapes and subdued color remain bound to traditional media and techniques. The plant he chose to paint however, is a fresh subject, suited to the art deco spirit that was emerging internationally. Chen Hengke died before he reached fifty, but the many artists who were his friends and students, among them Qi Baishi, advanced his ideals."
Paintings_after_old_masters,"Though he is relatively little known today, the Anhui painter Wu Long was famous enough during his own lifetime that the poet and local celebrity Wang Hongdu compared him to the celebrated Ming-dynasty artist Shen Zhou (1427–1509). This album reveals Wu to be a gifted stylist capable of working in a wide range of different manners, from the spare, linear mode favored by other Anhui masters to densely colored compositions of blue and green."
Creative_Copy_of_Xiang_Shengmo’s_“Reading_beneath_Autumn_Trees”,"In the nineteenth century, painters like Dai Xi expanded the notion of copying ancient masters to include more recent artists, such as Xiang Shengmo of the seventeenth century. Here, Dai has drastically reduced Xiang’s original painting (British Museum) to a few simple elements: a riverbank with a scholar and three intertwined trees. In this way, Dai focused on capturing the essence of Xiang’s work rather than creating an exact copy."
Couplet,"清朝 伊秉綬 行書 對聯 絹本During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), pairs of hanging scrolls known as couplets (duilian) became popular as gifts. They were intended for public display, often during seasonal holidays, weddings, and other auspicious occasions. The rules for couplets are strict: only two lines of poetry could be presented, one on each scroll, and there had to be many parallel structures between the two. Here, using lines from two poems of the Tang dynasty (617–906), Yi Bingshou has created an example of “gathered verses,” in which lines from older poems are joined into new combinations. The couplet reads:Right: Deep colors penetrate heaven, two thousand feetin height!Left: Beautiful flowers emerge from earth, and climb twoflights of stairs.The highly original style of Yi’s semicursive script was also the result of a thoughtful combination. Some of the character structures are taken from clerical script, while the fluidity of the writing is due to a semicursive approach. The extreme variation in the brushwork from thin and pointy to thick and blunt is a mixture of the two."
Couplet,"You may have your method;As for me, I love my hut.This pithy verse by Zhou Lianggong may be taken as a mission statement for the recluse: regardless of what society may wish from you, inner peace is to be found at home, behind a closed gate, in a life of self-cultivation. In his lengthy career of service to the Ming and Qing dynasty governments, Zhou enjoyed great heights of success and suffered terrible depths of persecution, so his understanding of the appeal of withdrawal was well-earned."
Gentlemen_gazing_at_a_waterfall,"The people who occupy premodern Chinese landscape paintings are often shown appreciating nature, as if teaching the viewer by example how to engage with the world around them. Here, two gentlemen sit in the shade of a bamboo grove absorbed in the sight and sound of a small waterfall plunging into a stream."
2003.3.1,"Fang became famous in the early 1990s for a series of paintings featuring bald-headed men whose expressions were difficult to read— some were either screaming or yawning, others staring blankly or maybe menacingly out at the viewer. This image, too, is ambiguous: the man in the center is clearly exerting himself, but it remains unclear whether he is swimming or being pulled under by the violent waves around him. Fang may be making a commentary on contemporary society and the struggle of the individual to stay afloat within it, but the ultimate meaning of this image remains defiantly unclear."
Landscapes_after_old_masters,"These landscapes offer an idiosyncratic tour through painting history. Dai Xi manipulates the textures and shapes associated with work by Huang Gongwang (1269–1354), Shen Zhou (1427–1509), Wu Li (1632–1718), and Yun Shouping (1633–1690), asking us to consider how we understand these four painters, both separately and together, across time."
Couplet,"清 趙之謙 篆書 對聯 紙本One of Zhao Zhiqian’s great accomplishments was the revival of seal script, an ancient script that served as China’s main form of writing from around 1200 B.C to 200 B.C. Seal script is onerous to write: it requires the calligrapher to move slowly and maintain a regular line width while making tortuous turns of the brush. This is why it was abandoned in favor of faster forms of writing and, in part, why it was so attractive to calligraphers like Zhao, who enjoyed the challenge posed by this old-fashioned way of writing. Zhao’s sinuous line is inspired by ancient seal script, but, here, his calligraphy is a creative interpretation that combines elements of other scripts, such as strokes that flare or taper toward the end.The text (translated and transcribed in standard script below) is a poem composed from two separate works by Gong Zizhen (1792–1841).Right: Do not rashly claim the prestige that Xie [An (320–385)] had in his time.Left: Just set your own fashion, and do not be a teacher of it.別有狂言謝時望但開風氣不為師"
Landscapes,"He Weipu takes traditional landscape compositions as a point of departure. Like the early Qing individualist painter Gong Xian (ca. 1619–89), He constructs landscape forms with dramatic contrasts of light and dark; but where Gong creates pensive abstractions, He moves in the direction of photography with its volumetric yet graphic chiaroscuro. Photography was introduced into China at mid-century, and by the 1880s photographic images were readily available in Shanghai in popular weekly magazines.He Weipu’s velvety ink textures are built with the traditional vocabulary of brushstrokes and layered ink wash, but in places these are arranged to imitate the crosshatching of Western draftsmanship.He Weipu was the grandson of the 19th century and calligrapher and official He Shaozhi (1799–1873)"
Mi_Fu_at_Stone_Worship,"Yu Ming, a close friend of Wu Changshi (1844–1927), worked in Shanghai, primarily as a figure painter. Here, Yu depicts a famous story about the Northern Song poet, politician, painter, and connoisseur Mi Fu (1052–1107), who was known as much for his outspokenness as for his refined tastes. The painting recalls Mi's appointment to the post of magistrate in the district of Wuwei (present-day Anhui). When Mi entered the official residence for the first time, he was struck by an imposing rock in the garden. He immediately called for his official robe and tablet of office, then bowed deeply to the stone, addressing it as ""Elder Brother Rock."""
Cat_and_Butterfly,"Zhu Xubai joined the Imperial Army in 1851, but finding that his sympathies lay with the Taiping, he deserted and became a monk, taking the name Xu Gu. Alienated and without roots, he traveled between Yangzhou, Suzhou and Shanghai selling his paintings. He had been trained in a portrait shop to paint the realistic ancestor images much in demand, but the majority of his paintings give little evidence of traditional training. His creativity lies in devising a light, fresh means of rendering the impression of things as they are seen.Xu Gu has invoked the 18th century Yangzhou Eccentric Hua Yen's (1682–1765) humorous animal subjects, though he has not attempted Hua's technical virtuosity. Active viewing is required to fuse the dotted outline suggesting the cat's fur and the impressionistic strokes of his landscape also seen in this exhibition"
Journey_in_Search_of_My_Parents,"In this album, Huang Xiangjian imaginatively recreates scenes from his perilous journey through southwest China in search of his parents, with whom he had lost contact following the Manchu conquest in the mid-1640s. In one of the most celebrated acts of filial piety in history, he set out in 1652 from his home in Suzhou and returned with them after one and a half years, covering more than 1,400 miles in the round-trip journey.Travel-related imagery had been a feature of Suzhou painting since the late fifteenth century. Huangcreated several works to document his grueling experience in both the handscroll and album formats. The paintings illustrate actual sites across the spectacular but treacherous terrains through which he struggled. On each leaf, he inscribes a short text about the topography, history, and customs of the depicted site. Huang’s dramatically exaggerated scenery may nonetheless be based on preliminary sketches recording his direct observations. His brush methods and compositional devices, though quite independent of established conventions, eloquently articulate the wonders and perils of nature.cat. no. 39"
Landscapes,"After earning his jinshi degree in the civil-service examinations in 1779, Yi Bingshou served as governor of Huizhou and Yangzhou. He is best known for his distinctive calligraphy in seal, clerical, and regular scripts, but he also dabbled in painting.In this album Yi carefully modulated his brushline and used the calligraphic effects of dry and wet ink to render landscapes in the styles of earlier masters. The style of his weighty strokes points in the direction taken later in the nineteenth century by Wu Dacheng (1835–1902) and He Weipu (1844–1925)."
Character_Image_of_Black_Character_Font,"From the mid-1980s, Wu began to play with the visual language of the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), coopting and tweaking the red, white, and black graphical style of the big-character posters that defined that era. Where those posters strove for maximum legibility, Wu undermines understanding at every turn. Four of the six images exhibited here are legible—“yes, this, crowd, yet” (是,此,丛,而)—while the characters in the other two images have been effaced or torn. But even the legible characters defy interpretation. By selecting words that function as grammatical particles, Wu removes the possibility of reading meaning into them. Works such as these made Wu one of the pioneers of language-based art in China in the 1980s."
"Lichened_Stone_and_Plants,_after_Ling_Yunhan_(active_second_half_of_the_14th_century),_Leaf_from_the_Ten_Bamboo_Studio_Collection_of_Calligraphy_and_Painting","The Ten Bamboo Studio Collection of Calligraphy and Painting is one of the earliest color-printed picture collections in China and the first to capture the subtle nuance of brushstrokes. It is named after the Ten Bamboo Studio of the scholar Hu Zhengyan in Nanjing. Hu compiled calligraphies and paintings by past and contemporary artists, then had them carved and printed by a skilled team in eight volumes with 186 pictures and 140 matching poems. These leaves are among the earliest and finest imprints of existing versions from the original blocks."
Mythos_of_Lost_Dynasties_Series—Negative_and_Positive_Characters,"Each of these three hanging scrolls is inscribed with the characters zheng 正 and fan 反. When juxtaposed, the words can mean ""correct” and “contrary,” “proper” and “improper,” “front” and “back,” “orthodox” and “unorthodox,” thus calling into question what is correct or incorrect in art or in social behavior. In all three scrolls the two characters are written one above another, starkly silhouetted in black ink against a white ground. Gu uses a variety of techniques to undermine their graphic and lexical force, including writing them backward, literally contradicting their semantic sense. The characters in the flanking scrolls are also partially obscured by dark forms that resemble standing figures. As is the case with many of Gu’s works created around the mid-1980s, conceptual interrogations of the written word are often tied to social critique."
Crying_Landscape,"In Crying Landscape, Yang deploys the antique “blue-and-green” painting style on a grand scale to depict iconic man-made structures that connote political, industrial, or military power. The triptychs were first displayed at the 2003 Venice Biennale, where they were hung from the ceiling and accompanied by a soundtrack of Johan Strauss II’s The Blue Danube waltz punctuated by the sound of the artist’s screams. Arranged in the same order here, the sequence showcases the Houses of Parliament, an oil refinery, the great dam at the mouth of the Yangzi Gorges, the Pentagon under terrorist attack, and a Las Vegas simulacrum of New York. Yang, who witnessed the enormous suffering brought about by Mao’s utopian vision of socialism, here undermines the promise of stability, prosperity, and security symbolized by these iconic buildings."
"Project_to_Extend_the_Great_Wall_of_China_by_10,000_Meters:_Project_for_Extraterrestrials_No._10","In this ambitious pyrotechnic display, the artist has appropriated the Great Wall as a piece of Land Art, revitalizing one of China’s most enduring cultural icons by tapping into its perceived cosmic energy. For this work, Cai and a team of volunteers laid a ten-kilometer fuse across the barren ridges of the Gobi Desert, starting at the westernmost end of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) wall at Jiayuguan, Gansu Province. Small charges were placed along the line at three-meter intervals, while larger charges were set at every kilometer. The fuse was ignited at dusk on February 27, 1993. The initial explosion took fifteen minutes to travel the entire length of the line and was seen by forty thousand residents and tourists. For Cai, this collective effort also subverted the Great Wall’s “original practice and ideological function.”"
Insects_and_Flowers,"Ju Lian, unlike his older cousin Ju Chao, was gregarious and indulgent. When Ju Lian departed from the renowned garden villa of the official Chang Jingxiu, he was given several young concubines as a gift. For them Ju built his villa ""Garden of the Ten Fragrances"" in Fanyu. He kept it filled with visiting notables and painters, and planted the gardens in the effusive style of Chang's villa.Ju Lian's appreciation of things pretty and amusing is evident in his paintings of meticulously observed flora and fauna. As the teacher of Gao Jianfu (who in turn taught his own brother Gao Qifeng) and Chen Shufen, Ju Lian is the progenitor of the ""Lingnan School"" in the Guandong region, characterized by realistic images, high color and a wide range of subjects."
"Portrait_of_Bi_Shichang,_from_the_set_Five_Old_Men_of_Suiyang","This portrait is one of a set that commemorates a gathering of five retired gentlemen at Suiyang, Henan Province. The sensitive delineation of features in contrast to the thick shaded brush lines of the garment reflects Tang dynasty conventions of official portraiture and a conservatism appropriate to the subject. Equally formal is the inscription written in regular script-a style also used for steles and official documents.Two portraits from this set of five are at the Freer Gallery, Washington, D.C., and two are in the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut."
"Mythos_of_Lost_Dynasties_Series—Tranquility_Comes_from_Meditation_(Primitive_World,_Composition_of_Words,_and_Synthesized_Words)","A leading figure in the New Wave experimental art movement of the 1980s, Gu sought to liberate his painting and calligraphy from traditional technical and aesthetic strictures. Among his earliest works are these three scrolls, part of an original pentad that feature characters hovering over or within surreal “splashed ink” landscapes. The central scroll, with its single invented ideograph suspended over a landscape, established the pattern for most of Gu’s later works in the Mythos of Lost Dynasties series. The full ideograph is unreadable, but the three cursive-script components (易, 申, 示) may be interpreted as the character for “unobstructed” (chang畅 畅) and that for “spirit” (shen 神). While Gu’s overriding purpose may have been to subvert the semantic function of calligraphy, his creation of a “new” symbol embodying the notion of an unfettered spirit is a powerful emblem of his wish to escape cultural stereotypes."
Map_of_the_Grand_Canal_from_Beijing_to_the_Yangzi_River,"Managing China's complex network of rivers, canals, and irrigation systems has been one of the abiding concerns of its rulers. From the fourteenth century, the Grand Canal served as the major artery for transporting grain from the wealthy agricultural regions south of the Yangzi River to the capital city of Beijing in the north. Of equal importance was the constant threat of flooding from the Yellow River and other river systems that traversed the canal. Under the Manchu Qing dynasty (1644–1911), both the Kangxi (r. 1662–1722) and Qianlong (r. 1736–95) emperors personally inspected the hydraulic management measures in this region on their periodic tours of the empire.This map follows the course of the Grand Canal from the vicinity of Beijing southward to the Yangzi River. Artistically, it stands halfway between modern cartographic records and the more pictorial approach to mapmaking that was commonly used prior to the twentieth century in China. While most elements are schematically rendered, images of the Forbidden City, the Yangzi River, and certain mountains and topographic features are treated in pictorial terms. All of the rivers, canals, dams, sluice gates, dikes, and catchment basins as well as the walled cities and important towns situated near the canal are depicted and labeled. The linchpin of the entire hydraulic system was the confluence of the Yellow and Huai Rivers with the Grand Canal. Based on documented changes to the configuration of the Huang-Huai confluence and other areas, the content of the map can be dated to the period from 1737 to 1761."
Returning_Fisherman_in_Misty_Rain,"A native of Nanjing, Zhang Feng was known for his poetry, painting, and seal carving. Without formal training, he created a strongly linear style in his landscapes that suggests the influence of Anhui School painters active in Nanjing. Here, linear forms modeled with touches of light ink wash generate a rhythmic momentum across the composition. The pervasive mist endows the sensitively rendered landscape elements with an inviting lyricism. His inscription reads:Dark clouds over the cliffs linger into daytime;Light mist mixed with drizzles obscures the green moss.In a straw cape and bamboo hat, a man holds a long rodby the river,While white egrets fly back and forth searching for fish.An old friend of the artist added an inscription in the upper left corner in 1683.cat. no. 47"
Landscapes,"A native of Anhui, Xiao Yuncong lived in Nanjing for varying periods of time. He painted this album near Nanjing in the ninth lunar month of 1645, shortly after the city’s fall to Manchu forces. Although only the first leaf is identified as a depiction of Nanjing’s famous Mount Qixia, the other pictures could also be evocations of local sites in different seasons.These twelve landscapes juxtapose the distinct local styles of Anhui and Nanjing, sometimes a jarring blend in a single painting. Xiao’s Anhui landscapes feature massive mountains reduced to geometric formations. Here, that style’s inherent coolness and abstraction is tempered by a lush blue and green palette, naturalistic landscape elements, and signs of human habitation—all traits that reflect the Nanjing painters’ interest in local topography and genre details.cat. no. 18"
Landscapes_of_the_Four_Seasons,"A professional painter with a successful career in Hangzhou, Lan Ying was acquainted with several members of the educated elite and acquired enough of their aesthetics to have devoted most of his creative energy to painting in scholarly idioms. In this spectacular set of seasonal landscapes, each scroll evokes the style of a different ancient master.The accuracy of Lan’s interpretations is sometimes hard to discern. More compelling and consistent are his own technical virtuosity and predilection for dramatic compositional effects. Foreground trees are always superb manifestations of his painterly craft. Comfortably shifting between the descriptive and the expressive modes, the diverse trees with their vivaciously gestural bodies and diverse foliage patterns provide sustained visual excitement as one progresses through the seasons.Lan Ying has inscribed each painting with a title and his source of inspiration (from right to left):“Spring Dawn on the Peach Blossom Spring,” [after] a paintingby Zhao Mengfu [1254–1322]“Elegant Dwellings of the Immortals,” after Jing Hao[active ca. 870–ca. 930]“Pure Shades in a Misty Vale,” after Juran’s [active ca. 960–85]“Xiao Yi Seizing the Lanting Manuscript through Trickery”“Gurgling Spring in a Wooded Vale,” after Huang Gongwang[1269–1354]“Layered Peaks with Towering Trees,” after Yan Wengui[active ca. 970–1030]; mid-summer, the gengyin year [1650]“Fisherman’s Flute by the Riverbank,” after Guo Xi[ca. 1000–ca. 1090]“Pure Streams in High Summer,” in the manner of Wu Zhen[1280–1354]“Boating Together down an Autumn Stream,” after Wang Meng[1308–1385]“Reminiscing the Ancient Past on an Autumn Mountain,”after Fan Kuan [ca. 960–ca. 1030]“Hoary Temple in Deep Green Mountains,” after Li Cheng[919–967]; mid-summer, the gengyin year [1650]“Riverbank Trees against Distant Peaks,” after Ni Zan[1306–1374]“Drifting Snow over Chilly Mountains,” after Wang Wei [701–761]cat. no. 12"
Selected_Scriptures,"Selected Scriptures is a series of thirty-seven prints encompassing maps, martial strategy, sacred cave temples, and the human body. Conceived to imitate pages from a traditional woodblock-printed book, the work challenges our notions of common knowledge. The artist has sought to compile a new “encyclopedia” to put forward his own understanding of the ever-changing world, reshuffling various aspects of culture to effectively dissolve boundaries and meanings, just like a computer virus. Hong’s images resemble ancient classics, but are rife with intentional text errors, misnomers, and cartographic misrepresentations that offer a humorous commentary on the diverse and subjective ways in which the world is visualized and understood.世界行政新图 新图In New Political World (1995) Hong has rearranged both the locations and shapes of countries and cities.世界防御设置要图In World Defense Layout Map (1995) Hong correctly identifies the continents but fills these landmasses with weaponry, armed figures, and victims of torture and rape.最新实用世界地图In Latest Practical World Map (1995) continents, oceans, and cities are given names that describe temporary and psychological states.世界测绘新图In New World Survey Map (1995) countries are represented according to their international status and influence.世界地域新览In New World Geomorphic Map (1996) the continents have been enlarged relative to the oceans.世界地形图In Physical World (1999) Hong transposes sea and land."
Views_of_Nanjing_for_Zhou_Lianggong,"When the scholar-official Zhou Lianggong was falsely imprisoned for bribery in Beijing in 1660, his friend Hu Yukun traveled north to visit him as he awaited judicial review. After returning home, Hu painted this intimate album of famous sites of Nanjing, the two men’s native city, in an effort to console Zhou with images of his beloved home. The next year, Zhou was released and returned home to Nanjing, where he resumed his position as the doyen of the city’s flourishing arts scene."
Viewing_a_waterfall_from_a_mountain_pavilion,"Li Yin was a professional painter from Yangzhou, a commercial city located on the Grand Canal just north of the Yangzi River in Jiangsu Province. During the late seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries, Yangzhou’s prosperity supported a number of artists. Li, together with his better-known contemporary Yuan Jiang (act. 1680–1730), worked in a studio of painters that specialized in intricately described visions of palatial architecture set within sumptuous blue-and-green landscapes. In reviving the monumental landscape style of the Tang and Song dynasties, Li Yin and Yuan Jiang also catered to a taste for large-scale hanging scrolls and multipanel screen paintings to decorate the ostentatious mansions of Yangzhou’s mercantile elite."
The_Daoist_Immortal_Han_Xiangzi,"This painting by the Ming court artist Liu Jun depicts the Daoist immortal Han Xiangzi miraculously treading the surface of a turbulent sea. Unperturbed by the roiling waves beneath his feet or the wind that pulls at his garments, Han casually puts a bamboo flute to his lips to play a tune. His eccentrically rustic clothes mark him as a transcendent being: he wears a rustic cape of sawtoothed leaves and curly vegetal tendrils. Over his pants hangs a skirt of reeds. Over his shoulder hangs a satchel lined with animal fur, and his belt holds two dried gourds—the traditional vessel of magical Daoist elixirs.The waves at the immortal’s feet are described with a striking geometric pattern of modulated lines interspersed with corresponding sections of reserved silk. Bold patches of blank silk have been left in reserve across the painting’s middle to indicate numinous mist that accompanies the immortal on his magical journey. Along the painting’s top edge are quickly drawn lines of monochrome ink and a large patch of ink wash, a terse indication of a towering mountain landscape that lies beyond the seething ocean.Liu Jun employed a range of different brush modes in depicting Han Xiangzi, showcasing the technical virtuosity that was expected of a Ming court artist. The immortal’s face is depicted through a combination of gently graded washes of pigment with confidently drawn lines of ink and cinnabar. The hair and beard consist of two different weights of lines combined with a wash to impart a sense of hairy tactility. The large relative scale of the figure, combined with the delicate brushwork of the sensitively rendered face, creates a naturalistic effect similar to portraiture. By contrast, the bravura brushwork of the robes is self-consciously performative, meant to be read as a display of the painter’s daring technical virtuosity. The bold painterly quality of the robes’ contours is intended to contrast with the naturalism of the face, heightening the illusion of the likeness.Little is known about the life of Liu Jun, but his surviving paintings, along with fragmentary textual evidence, demonstrate that he was a gifted painter of figures, landscapes, and architecture who served the Ming court in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Daoist immortals most commonly appear in Chinese mythology as a group of eight—a ragtag band of merry, numinous eccentrics, each featuring his own special attribute—and this painting almost certainly originally belonged to a set of eight that was meant to be displayed together."
Palace_banquet,"This large painting is one of the earliest surviving examples of the “ruled-line” (jiehua) genre of architectural renderings. It offers an intimate view of the women’s quarters of a palace where elegant rooms face onto private courtyards graced with trees and blossoming lotus, an indication of the summer season. Activity centers around a second-story terrace where women at a banqueting table point skyward or concentrate on threading needles. On the seventh day of the seventh month, women traditionally decorated their homes, set out fruits, and competed in threading needles as part of the festivities celebrating the one night each year when the Herd Boy and the Weaving Maid, legendary lovers immortalized as constellations, are allowed to meet. Behind the banquet, a woman knocks at a gate, beyond which, to the left, another woman claps her hands beside a bed to awaken its occupant. A third woman, to the right, gazes out beneath two trees that have grown intertwined—a symbol, perhaps, of the fateful union about to occur. At the upper right, two women prepare to open the gate to a visitor.The painting alludes to the love affair between the Tang emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–56) and his consort, Yang Guifei, who famously slept all day to arise refreshed at night. In 755, a rebellion broke out as a consequence of the emperor’s inattention to rulership. Xuanzong was forced to flee, and the palace guards blamed Yang Guifei for the insurrection. They forced the emperor to execute her before escorting him to safety. Bai Juyi’s (772–846) epic poem, The Song of Everlasting Sorrow, describes the tragic story, beginning with the fateful tryst alluded to by the painting. Both poem and painting may be read as admonitions against neglecting state affairs."
Scenery_of_the_Yellow_Mountains_(Huangshan),"A monk from Huai'an, Jiangsu Province, Xuezhuang spent many years wandering from temple to temple before settling in 1689 in the remote peaks of Mount Huang, in southern Anhui Province. Although he lived in seclusion, his reputation for high-minded eremitism attracted travelers who sought him out to discuss Chan (Zen in Japanese) Buddhism and to admire his music, poetry, and paintings.This album of highly personal, topographic images, executed in delicate, dry brushwork, emphasizes how natural rock formations often resemble human or animal figures. The paintings are further embellished with poetry and prose notations by the artist, in which he identifies peaks that had either Buddhist or personal associations. Not only were such paintings products of scholarly practice but they could also function as souvenirs for those who made the arduous climb to Mount Huang or as a visual evocation of the mountain for those unable to travel.Beginning in the late sixteenth century, the area around Mount Huang grew prosperous thanks to the wealth of Anhui merchant networks and to such indigenous products as ink, paper, and woodblockprinted books. As local artists celebrated the scenic wonders of their home region, Mount Huang became a sightseeing destination. By Xuezhuang's time, the mountain's picturesque scenery, hot springs, Buddhist temples, and hostels attracted a steady stream of tourists and pilgrims."
Landscapes,"Xiao Yuncong was born into a gentry family in the town of Wuhu, Anhui Province, but for most of his career he resided in Nanjing, only fifty-five miles downriver. Between 1636 and 1642 Xiao and his two younger brothers prepared for the provincial-level civil-service examinations in Nanjing, where they also became political activists, joining the Fushe “Revival Society,” which sought to revive antique moral standards as a remedy for government factionalism and corruption. The fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644 ended Xiao’s government ambitions. Unwilling to serve under the Manchus, Xiao supported himself as a painter.The present album, executed when Xiao was seventy-two, exemplifies his painterly abilities at their peak. Xiao expertly applied delicate colored washes and monochrome texturing to model landscape forms and suggest the veiling effects of atmosphere. Although Xiao’s images allude to antique models of the Song and Yuan dynasties, these gemlike miniatures recall nothing so much as the lyrical representations of landscape created by the contemporary professional masters of Nanjing.Artist's inscription:In his inscription, Xiao rejects the emphasis on abstract expressive brushwork championed by Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) scholar-artists in favor of the “old methods,” by which he presumably means the more descriptive techniques of the Song dynasty (960–1279) masters.When the ancients made paintings, they were not afraid of being extremely meticulous. I once saw Mojie’s [Wang Wei, 699–759] Wangchuan Villa; it was so intricately done that it looked as if it had been engraved. From Yuan times on, artists have emphasized [the expressive qualities of] spirit resonance and plain sparseness, and the archaic methods were gradually eclipsed. The brushwork of these eight small scenes is slight and scattered. If it had been more coherent, then [these paintings] would not lack the impact of “a thousand miles [of scenery] in a few inches [of paper].”Cangya, fellowship leader and colleague, has a profound grasp of the Six Methods [of painting] and will certainly understand these words.In the fifth lunar month, the summer of the wushen year [June 9–July 8, 1668], XiaoYuncong"
Waiting_for_the_Ferry,"In this stark scene of barren trees and snow-covered, distant mountains, the artist has combined the ""one-corner"" compositional formula of the Song Imperial Painting Academy with the Fan Kuan (active ca. (990–1030) idiom of ""small ax-cut"" stippled rocks and stocky trees with bare, stubby branches to evoke a mood of chilly quietude. The scene focuses on two travelers awaiting the arrival of a ferryman in his small boat. The angular foreground boulders and spiky trees contrast with the gray-and-white expanse of water, sky, and snowshrouded mountains, set off by a flock of circling birds—emphasizing the sense of hushed stillness."
Man_Sleeping_on_a_Bamboo_Couch,"The three-panel screen painting within this painting creates a metaphorical, as well as illusionistic, space within an intimate composition. The sleeping scholar, his contented face turned toward the viewer, seems to be dreaming peacefully. The artist cannot depict the gentleman's dream, but the mesmerizing pattern of waves covering the screen that encloses the man is highly suggestive of his serene state of mind."
Palaces_among_Autumn_Mountains,"During the Yuan dynasty, the archaic blue-and-green landscape style was revived by scholar-artists in the south, who sought new modes of self-expression through a conscious return to models of the past. The rich mineral pigments that characterize this style also made it a favorite of professional and court painters, who never entirely stopped producing decorative works in this manner.This fan painting and its mate, Village and Temples in Jiangnan, typify late fourteenth- and early fifteenth-century interpretations of this decorative style. The prominent use of “hemp-fiber wrinkles” to texture rock surfaces reflects the late Yuan preference for the brush idiom of Dong Yuan (active 930s–960s) and Juran (active 960–95); the complex composition and confident rendering of three-dimensional forms in space closely parallel the landscape murals (dated 1358) at the Yonglegong temple."
Plate_depicting_a_lady_with_parasol,"The Dutch East India Company, which dominated the export of Chinese porcelains to Europe in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, commissioned the Dutch artist Cornelis Pronk (1691–1759) to supply designs that could be copied on porcelain intended for export. This design of a lady with a parasol was one of Pronk’s most popular compositions, and was employed by Japanese porcelain painters as well."
Hexagonal_teapot,"This teapot is a rare example of a pewter work that reflects literati taste during the late Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Its bold but elegant incised décor freely combines such scholarly motifs as images of flora and fauna, still lifes, poems, and ancient bronze inscriptions. Although it is a functional piece, it reflects the interaction of popular culture and elite antiquarianism in the late nineteenth century. The seal marks on its base and lid indicate that it was from the famous pewter workshop of Chen Wanfeng in Jiaxing, a wealthy city in the Yangzi delta region."
Lone_fisherman_on_a_boat,"The figure of the solitary boatman angling on a river was one of the most potent symbols of reclusion in premodern China. Beneath towering trees and backed by misty mountains, the gentleman relinquishes the cares of the dusty world and becomes one with the river and its ceaseless flow. Painted in broad, wet washes by Mao Qiling, a prominent scholar of the early Qing period (1662–1722), this image captures the theme of the fisherman-hermit and the joys of the river."
Landscape,"Bada Shanren rarely painted landscapes until he was nearly seventy years old, but as this album attests, he became a great master in this genre during the last decade of his life. These remarkably varied compositions reveal extraordinary sensitivity to the graphic function of negative space. Rocks are often modeled in faceted planes, while the expressive rendering of intersecting trees reveal the artist’s calligraphic sophistication.Bada’s primary inspiration for his landscapes was the late Ming master Dong Qichang (1555–1636). But this album also attests to his profound understanding of earlier masters and his bold departures from them. In his inscription on the last leaf, he not only sums up his artistic heritage but also echoes a Yuan master’s anguish over the demise of his native dynasty:Rocks textured in Guo’s [Guo Xi, ca. 1000–ca. 1090] method are topped with small clouds; Old Dong’s [Dong Yuan, active 930s–60s] hemp-fiber-like brushlines often model trees as well. I can imagine how his contemporaries interpreted his paintings: Yifeng [Huang Gongwang, 1269–1354] was still depicting the landscape of the Song empire.cat. no. 62"
Paintings_on_Miscellaneous_Subjects,"A native from Zhuji, in northern Zhejiang, Chen Zi survived extreme hardship in childhood during the early years of the Manchu conquest. As a professional artist, however, his works reflect little anguish over the dynastic change.In both painting and calligraphy, Chen Zi followed the style of his illustrious father, the highly influential artist Chen Hongshou (1599–1652). Although the son tended to reduce the father’s archaic mannerisms into hardened conventions, he was no less versatile or experimental. This album, which covers the genres of landscape, human figure, flower-and-bird, and animal painting, demonstrates the range of his talents. The landscapes are intended to exemplify the contrasting ""dry” and “wet” modes. Finely outlined flowers are juxtaposed with leaves rendered in graded ink washes in the “boneless” manner. The gaunt monk distracted by a strange animal may allude to a folk- or Buddhist tale.cat. no. 71"
"Paying_homage_to_Xiwangmu,_the_Queen_Mother_of_the_West","The auspicious subject of this fan painting is the birthday anniversary of Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of the West. Standing atop an ornately furnished terrace, the three Daoist immortals Lü Dongbin, Han Zhongli, and Zhang Guolao are depicted reverently paying their respects to the queen of the Daoist pantheon. The figures, drawn with a minimum of calligraphic flourish, seem to be the work of a professional painter of the fifteenth century."
Daoist_immortals_in_a_landscape,"This painting invites the viewer to follow a mountain path across a stone arch and into a magical realm where herb gatherers dressed in garments of leaves and grass mingle with robed gentlemen engaged in scholarly pleasures: viewing paintings, playing weiqi (go, in Japanese), strumming a zither, composing poetry, engaging in ""pure conversation,"" and contemplating the scenery. The scroll ends with an imposing terrace for viewing the sky and a cave-an entrance to a Daoist grotto-heaven. Based on the two-character signature at the left edge of the scroll, the painting has been identified as the work of Shen Xiyuan, a late fourteenth-century practitioner of the Southern Song academic tradition of Ma Yuan (active ca. 1190–1225). But many of the figural and landscape details reflect the styles of such mid-sixteenth-century artists as Zhou Chen and Qiu Ying, suggesting that a more appropriate date for the scroll would be the later sixteenth or early seventeenth century."
New_Classic_of_Mountains_and_Seas_I,"In 2006, Qiu Anxiong completed his ambitious three-channel video New Classic of Mountains and Seas (I). Inspired by the ancient Chinese cosmography Classic of Mountains and Seas (Shanhai jing山海經), Qiu told a dystopic story of a land overrun by strange creatures, many of which had menacing overtones of technology run amok. To create the visual language of his animations, Qiu developed a technique of painting with dilute acrylic that evokes traditional Chinese ink painting. He uses these paintings—which he continuously alters, as the basis for his digitally manipulated animations. Originals such as these are the artifacts of this process."
Eighteen_Songs_of_a_Nomad_Flute:_The_Story_of_Lady_Wenji,"Represented here are scenes from the life of Lady Wenji (Cai Yan), who was abducted by a horde of marauding barbarians about A.D. 195 and spent twelve years among the Xiongnu, a Mongol tribe, as wife of their chieftain. She bore him two children before she was finally ransomed and returned to China. The Southern Song emperor Gaozong (r. 1127–62) probably ordered the story illustrated as a reminder of the capture of his kinfolk by the Jurchen Jin.In this scroll, the costumes of the nomad invaders are those of the Khitan people, who established the Liao dynasty (907–1125) in northeastern China. To the early Southern Song viewer, Eighteen Songs, which presents a historical drama in contemporary details, did not represent a mere historical romance but a true, pervasive national trauma. The illustrations to the third, fifth, thirteenth, and eighteenth songs in the Metropolitan's scroll—the oldest of five known versions that illustrate all eighteen of the songs—are almost exact copies of four album leaves in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The Boston fragments appear to be all that is left of the original twelfth-century scroll. The texts of the songs, composed by Liu Shang (act. ca. 773), are inscribed in the calligraphic style of Emperor Gaozong"

Scholars_of_the_Liuli_Hall,"Scholars of the Liuli Hall commemorates a famous gathering hosted by the poet Wang Changling (act. ca. 713-41) at his official residence in Jiangning (modern Nanjing, Jiangsu Province). An earlier, cut-down version of the same composition, entitled simply Literary Gathering (Palace Museum, Beijing), is attributed to Han Huang (723-787). The costumes and the style in which the figures are drawn, however, relate these works to Zhou Wenju, the great Southern Tang (937-75) court painter who used a ""tremulous brush line"" (zhanbi) to draw drapery.In the Metropolitan's scroll, Zhou's tenth-century style has been transformed by a thirteenth-century artist. The sensitively drawn faces are late Song in style; while more schematic than Tang (618-907) examples, they are more solidly and three-dimensionally conceived than those of the late Ming (16th-17th century). In describing the figures' robes, Zhou Wenju's ""tremulous brush line"" has become a virtuoso performance: elegant fluttering lines, at once playful and confident, are well integrated, and the hooks and curves representing creases and pockets show an extravagant realism matched only by the best late Southern Song Academy figure painters."
Eight_Kinds_of_Jin_and_Tang_Writings_in_Small_Standard_Script,"This set of rubbings replicates a canon of standard script writings attributed to the Jin dynasty master Wang Xizhi (ca. 303–ca. 361) as well as two of his greatest Tang dynasty followers: Yu Shinan (558–638) and Chu Suiliang (596–658). These writings, a fundamental source for later students of standard script, were first preserved in carved stone during the Tang dynasty, but rubbings continued to be made from this set until modern times."
Children_playing_in_the_palace_garden,"Twenty-two boys play games, ride hobbyhorses (a toy that may have been invented in China), and enjoy a large masonry slide in the corner of an imperial garden. Children at play was a popular subject among artists of the earlier Song Imperial Painting Academy. Judging from the costumes and representational techniques, this painting was most likely executed in the first years of the Ming dynasty, when the imperial court revived the styles and subjects of the academy."
Fishing_on_a_snowy_river,"Since Southern Song painting concentrates more on smaller formats such as handscrolls, fans, and album leaves, hanging scrolls from the period are comparatively scarce. Fishing on a Snowy River evokes a monumental landscape scene in the Northern Song tradition of Fan Kuan (active ca. 990–1030), albeit through the simplified motifs and brush formulas of Fan’s Southern Song followers Li Tang (ca. 1070s–ca. 1150s) and Liang Kai (active first half of the 13th century). The intimate focus and the interest in genre details in the foreground are typical of the thirteenth century."
Towing_a_Boat_in_a_Rainstorm,"In this painting, the modulated brush lines and vivid use of ink washes to model forms and evoke a moisture-laden atmosphere betray none of the hallmarks of the Southern Song academic style as defined by Ma Yuan (active ca. 1190–1225) and Xia Gui (active ca. 1195–1230). Recalling the late eleventh-century style of Guo Xi and other Northern Song masters, the painting can reasonably be dated to the early Southern Song era."
Plate,"The scene on this plate is copied from a design by Abraham Bloemaert (1564–1651) included in his drawing book and first engraved by his son Cornelis II (ca. 1603–ca. 1680). The scene as shown on this and other examples is, however, taken from a reverse copy, perhaps that published by the unidentified Casp."
Chan_master_riding_a_mule,"Painted in a few swift brushstrokes and deftly applied ink washes, Chan Master Riding a Mule exemplifies the freely expressive manner of Chan (Zen, in Japanese) Buddhist painting, which relies less on descriptive detail than on the capturing of spiritual concentration within the artist to achieve a vivid depiction. Inscribed by the noted Chan master Wuzhun, to whom it traditionally has been attributed, the painting is probably the work of a contemporary Chan artist following the sketchy brush style of Liang Kai (active first half of the thirteenth century).Wuzhun, well known for his wisdom as well as for his eccentric behavior, inscribed this painting while he was living at the Qingshansi, a Chan temple near Hangzhou, where he settled after he was rewarded by Emperor Lizong (r. 1225–1264) following an imperial audience. The rider's facial features-prominent forehead, mustache, and wispy beard-are not unlike those of Wuzhun himself, whose formal portrait, with an inscription by him dated 1238, is now in the Tofuku-ji temple in Kyoto. His laconic inscription may also be a self-deprecatory reference to himself:As rain darkens the mountain,One mistakes a mule for a horse."
Palampore,"An impossible abundance of differently shaped blooms and fantastically patterned insects animates this Tree of Life. Embodying the expansion of global networks, this magnificent textile was executed by Chinese artists using Indian design conventions to appeal to European and American audiences. In size, format, tree shape, and figurative details, its design emulates painted and dyed chintz palampores created in India. This version, in contrast, features needlework, a skillset at which Chinese textile artists excelled. Like so many Indian dyed chintzes, this embroidered palampore was likely created for export to Britain, where it would have been admired as a bed covering."
Stele_for_Shi_Chen,"For nearly eighteen hundred years, the stone stele from which this rubbing was taken has stood in the Temple of Confucius, adjacent to the sage's birthplace in Qufu, Shandong Province. The stele bears engraved texts concerning rituals conducted at the temple in Confucius's memory. When the official Shi Chen arrived in Qufu in A.D. 168, he personally financed an elaborate ritual that included sacrificial offerings. He then submitted a memorial to Emperor Ling (r. 168–69) requesting funds to pay for the rituals each year in the spring and autumn.The calligraphy on the stele is an example of Han-dynasty clerical script. Originally developed by scribes and bureaucrats for everyday writing, this script type came to be widely used for stone inscriptions requiring strict, orderly forms of writing. In clerical script, blocky characters fit into an imaginary grid, and strokes tend to be of even thickness. Some horizontal strokes end in sharply defined, angular tips, while curved and downward-flaring strokes display complex shapes. The spacious layout of the text and even spacing of the strokes create a sense of dignity appropriate to the stele's placement within the temple precinct."
Puppies_Playing_beside_a_Palm_Tree_and_Garden_Rock,"The animals, plants, and craggy Taihu rock in this lighthearted garden scene are realistically described in a manner characteristic of the Southern Song Painting Academy. However, the slightly stiff and flat drawing as well as the relative coarseness of the silk indicate a later date, perhaps early Ming, when the reconstructed Imperial Painting Academy took the Song Academy style as its mode."
Lotus_at_Night,"Huang Yongyu absorbed the diverse styles he encountered while working for a newspaper in Hong Kong. He first earned a reputation as a woodblock artist. After the 1960s he concentrated on painting, using a wide variety of materials.Lotus at Night combines the painterly values of abstract expressionism with Chinese elements of gestural art and the reduction of an image to felt essentials. Huang's broad experimentation, like that of the generation that is succeeding him in China, is a natural response to a vast array of new choices."
Boating_by_a_Willow_Bank,"Evoking the scenery of Hangzhou's West Lake, this painting shows a gentleman being paddled across a placid inlet between a profusion of water lilies and a shore lined with willows. The composition recalls that of Li Jie's Fisherman's Lodge at Xisai of about 1170. As the boat glides through the silvery moonlight, stillness reigns on the cool, scented water. The simplicity of the painting recalls the spare imagery of a Tang-dynasty (618–907) quatrain:Willows still by a lotus bank,A boat drifts slowly by.Ahead, tall grass, blue distant hills,White moon in golden sky."
Chanting_on_Donkey-back,"The poem Lin inscribed on this fan reads:As one travels year after year, youth is spent.One is homesick with each backward glance at the setting sun.Sometimes at leisure, one can chant a poem.Why not take a ride when the willow blooms?[Trans. from Ellsworth et al, Later Chinese Painting]"
Landscapes_Depicting_Poems_of_Huang_Yanlü,"This album presents Shitao’s interpretations and transcriptions of travel poems by his patron-friendHuang Yanlü (Huang You, 1661–ca. 1725), a wealthy merchant of considerable cultural sophistication. The places mentioned in the poems include famous sites in Guizhou, Hunan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces.The album exemplifies Shitao’s extraordinary originality and versatility. Done in his old age, thelandscapes demonstrate the entire spectrum of his stylistic sources and innovations through decades of experimentation. Whether sketched in monochromes or meticulously finished in refined colors, they represent the perfect union of fresh observation and imaginationwith art-historical awareness.cat. no. 75"
Portrait_of_husband_and_wife,"A married couple sits on a low, backless couch in an elegant and opulent garden setting. Around them is a virtual anthology of auspicious images: the arching pine that frames the image evokes long life; the red-crowned crane longevity and marital fidelity; the bamboo hardiness; the plum blossom new life; and so on. This double portrait was probably commissioned for a special occasion such as a milestone birthday. After the death of the sitters, descendants may have venerated it in the family shrine."
Moonlit_terrace,"Chinese landscape paintings often depict night scenes, but the signals of darkness can be subtle. In this painting, a gentleman looks out from a low terrace onto a small stream that runs through his garden. Follow his gaze to three red candles at the left of the composition. These, along with the barely visible circle in the sky at upper right, reveal that our protagonist has come to revel in the cool evening breeze and the glimmer of moonlight on the water."
The_Immortal_Lü_Dongbin_Appearing_over_the_Yueyang_Pavilion,"This fan depicts the Daoist immortal Lü Dongbin hovering above the Yüeh-yang Lou, a famous pavilion on the east shore of Lake Dongting, in Hunan Province. During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the cult of Lü Dongbin flourished under the influence of the Quanzhen (""Perfect Realization"") sect of Daoism. The center of the cult was the Yongle Gong (Temple of Eternal Joy) in Shanxi Province. The painting style of the figures and the architecture and landscape details of this fan relate closely to murals in Yongle Gong that date to the latter half of the Yüan period (1279–1368). Therefore, the cyclical date dingsi inscribed on the wall outside the pavilion in this picture probably corresponds to the year 1377."
Two_Horses,"Executed at the height of the artist's career, Two Horses is a study in complements: dark and light horses; earthen shoreline and rocky outcrop; and contrasting species of trees. Charged with distinguishing between truth and falsehood, good and evil, Qian's imagery seems to reflect the powerful contending forces with which he had to deal during his precariously balanced career. His distinctive use of shading to model forms reveals the growing impact of European engravings and painting techniques on Chinese artists of this period.A noted calligrapher who also specialized in the painting of horses, Qian Feng is best known for twice risking his life by bringing charges against unscrupulous officials linked to the Qianlong emperor's favorite, the notoriously corrupt Heshen (1758–1799). Since the connoisseurship of fine horses was a metaphor for the ability to judge and select men for government service, Qian's artistic specialization was particularly appropriate in light of his official duties, which required him to evaluate the performance of his peers in the bureaucracy."
Horse_and_Willow_Tree,"Since the Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 220), fine horses have symbolized military power and imperial authority in China. For this reason, powerful steeds were a popular subject at the early Ming court. Frequently such paintings show sleek animals grazing, often tethered to willow trees. Perhaps such images were intended to connote an empire at peace, when warhorses were not required to subdue insurrection or combat foreign invaders"
"Old_Tree,_Bamboo,_and_Birds",Unsuspecting swallows weave among the bamboo while a preying hawk eyes them from the branch of an old tree. The unsentimental lesson to be learned from nature was that the strong prey upon the weak. The petty bureaucrat who abuses his authority is in turn the victim of the more powerful official.
Homage_to_a_Strange_Rock,"Rocks in extraordinary shapes—appreciated as miniature mountains—have been treasured by Chinese people since the Tang dynasty (618–907) and have inspired numerous pictorial and literary compositions. The rock in this painting, with its twisted body and multiple perforations, embodies the vitality of nature outlasting the ravages of time.It is no wonder that the owner of this painting traveled around to share it with friends and invite their comments, as the dozens of enthusiastic inscriptions around the image demonstrate. Each inscription reveals a different social encounter and a unique personality. Some also provide a glimpse into the urban gardens where the meetings took place."
Mythical_landscape_with_immortals,"This imposing set of ten silk tapestries depicts a mountainscape of magic and wonder. In the center, assembled scholars gaze up at a group of cloud-borne female immortals as they descend to the earthly realm. Waves surge with numinous intensity as auspicious cranes circle and mystical deer prance through the hills. The blue-green color palette reinforces the sense of a world inhabited by mystical forces. These colorful tapestries were created using the kesi technique, in which the picture is created by laboriously weaving in individual threads of different-colored silk, though their makers painted many of the details after weaving to speed up the process."
Basin_with_turtles_and_fish,"The design of this vessel reflects the fourteenth-century antiquarian taste. This type of water basin can be traced back to the Shang dynasty (ca. 1600–1046 B.C.), but the vessel’s design is based on a woodblock illustration in the 12th-century Xuanhe Bogutu, a catalogue of Song-dynasty imperial collection. The design of turtles and fish allude to the legend of a turtle that emerged from the Luo River bearing a divine book on its carapace. The vessel most likely functioned as a decorative piece in a scholar’s study meant to demonstrate the owner’s appreciation for antiquity."
Ten_Thousand_Miles_along_the_Yellow_River,"Given the constant threat of flooding from the Yellow River, the study and management of that river system was one of the highest priorities of the Qing court. This monumental map graphically illustrates the complexity of controlling the Yellow River's channel and its potential impact on the numerous towns and cities in its drainage area. Painted around the time that the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662–1722) engaged a team of Jesuit missionaries to conduct a comprehensive survey of his empire, the map reflects the highest level of indigenous mapmaking before the introduction of European techniques. Indeed, the map's appeal lies not in its cartographic accuracy but in its pictorial treatment of terrain features. To unroll the scrolls is to vicariously experience the drama of voyaging up the Yellow River from the East China Sea to the rapids of the Dragon Gate.The map merges panoramic landscape painting and cartography: waterways are rendered in a planometric fashion (that is, they lie flat on the picture surface); mountains are depicted frontally; and architecture, notably walled towns and cities, are shown as isometric projections. There is no consistent use of foreshortening, perspective, atmospheric distortion, or diminution of scale to suggest spatial recession. One may speak of the bottom or top of the composition, but there is no measurable distinction between the foreground and the far distance. Nevertheless, the map is visually coherent, and its seemingly unbounded view of vast expanses enables the viewer to grasp far more than the eye could see in reality."
The_Immortal_Lü_Dongbin_Appearing_over_the_Yueyang_Pavilion,"This album leaf appears to depict a scene in which the puckish Daoist immortal Lü Dongbin dazzles the local population of Yueyang by hovering over its famous pavilion on a magical cloud. In this artist’s rendition, the tower is almost a world unto itself, with broad galleries, soaring eaves, and a vast viewing platform. The magical landscape from which Lü has emerged is represented by a lone mountain, described economically with a broad, graded wash of dilute ink."
"Plum,_Bamboo_and_Rock","Blooming earlier than all other trees, the flowering plum (Prunus mume) is welcomed as the harbinger of spring and during the Southern Song period (1127–1279) became the object of intense admiration. By the mid-fourteenth century, as Mongol control disintegrated and society grew increasingly chaotic, the flowering plum became a powerful symbol of purity and endurance in the face of adversity.In a poem accompanying the painting, this unidentified scholar-painter recalls the poet Su Shi (1037–1101), who was banished from the capital in 1095 but found happiness in Plum Blossom Village, at the foot of Mount Luofu. By the second half of the fourteenth century, the kind of contentment discovered by Su Shi, like the path to the idyllic Plum Blossom Village, had become increasingly difficult to find. The poem reads:The flowing water of the stream glides by;Colorful birds chatter beneath the flowers.Of late I have taken an interest in [Mount] Luofu;But the path to the village grows dim in the twilight."
Nine_Songs,"In this handscroll, the poems’ deities are presented here in a single continuous landscape composition, each marked with an identifying inscription. The Nine Songs actually consists of eleven poems, each dedicated to a different divinity; ten are depicted here, followed by a portrait of the exiled minister Qu Yuan, who is traditionally considered the author of the poems."
Buddhist_Temples_amid_Autumn_Mountains,"Travelers wind their way through a riverine landscape dotted with rustic villages and Buddhist temples. As is the case with many Chinese paintings, the date of this one is difficult to determine. It boasts an impressive suite of colophons by fourteenth-century writers, including two renowned scholar-painters, Ni Zan and Lu Guang. Though the painting itself bears a signature of the tenth- to eleventh-century painter Yan Wengui, based on style it appears to be a copy from the fourteenth or fifteenth century, during or shortly after the time of Ni and Lu. Therefore, it is possible that these colophons were originally made for an earlier painting but later mounted to this work to enhance its value."
Teabowl,"The Dutch East India Company, which dominated the export of Chinese porcelains to Europe in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, commissioned the Dutch artist Cornelis Pronk (1691–1759) to supply designs that could be copied on porcelain intended for export. The drawings were sent to China and Japan from Batavia in 1736. This design of a lady with a parasol was one of Pronk’s most popular compositions, and was employed by Japanese porcelain painters as well."
Saucer,"The Dutch East India Company, which dominated the export of Chinese porcelains to Europe in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, commissioned the Dutch artist Cornelis Pronk (1691–1759) to supply designs that could be copied on porcelain intended for export. The drawings were sent to China and Japan from Batavia in 1736. This design of a lady with a parasol was one of Pronk’s most popular compositions, and was employed by Japanese porcelain painters as well."
Wangchuan_Villa,"The eighth-century poet and painter Wang Wei was so taken with the beauty of his country estate that he decided to celebrate it with a cycle of twenty poems extolling various sites on the property and a painted handscroll that depicted the grounds. The poems have been part of the core curriculum for students of Chinese literature for a millennium, and although the original painting was lost long ago, its composition has survived in the form of rubbings and painted copies. This example merges the naive architectural forms of the original composition with the elegant painterly sensibility of the sixteenth-century followers of Wen Zhengming (1470–1559)."
Ink_Garden_of_the_Cheng_Family,Ink Garden of the Cheng Family is a catalogue of decorative designs for inkstones and ink cakes. Some of the designs were made by well-known artists of the time. This image was printed with a single block. Either multiple colors were brushed onto it at once or the block was reused repeatedly to apply one color at a time.
"The_Great_Fountain,_Main_Facade","This view of the “European Palaces” in the Garden of Perfect Brightness (Yuanming Yuan), an imperial estate on the outskirts of Beijing, shows the main fountain, decorated with a stag faced by hounds, as well as two pyramidal fountains and meticulously shaped trees. The complex of buildings and gardens was conceived in 1747 by the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–96), who ordered two missionaries, Giuseppe Castiglione and Michel Benoist, to design it in the European style. This engraving forms part of a set of mounted prints illustrating the “European Palaces” commissioned by the emperor and produced by Chinese engravers."
Dish,The design is considered to be the first version of Pronk's second of four designs commissioned by the Dutch East India Company.
Great_Ease_(Da_zi_zai),"This rectangular seal is made from translucent yellow-green soapstone with irregular markings in varying shades of gray. The bottom shows red stains from making impressions with red seal paste; the top is also tinted red, probably from contact with the stained interior of its storage box. The legend of the seal, “Great Ease” (Da zizai 大自在) , is carved in relief with evenly spaced lines of consistent width that are characteristic of seal script calligraphy. Each of the seal’s four sides is incised with a grid of four columns and 19 lines, which the artist has filled with a carved standard-script transcription of the Heart Sutra."
"Blossoming_Plum,_Rock,_and_Birds,_after_Chen_Hongshou","This is among the largest of Xie's several traced copies of a composition by Chen Hongshou (1599–1652). He even copied Chen's inscription, which reads: ""Shou painted this at Xiqiao [in Zhuji, Zhejiang province, Chen's hometown]."""
Jinshan_and_the_Yangzi_River,"This monumental painting presents a bird’s-eye view of Jinshan, an island near Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, in the lower reaches of the Yangzi River. The artist presents the complexly layered architecture of the Buddhist monastery—crowned at the top by a multistoried pagoda and occupying much of the small island—in intricate detail, but the true subject of the painting is mighty Yangzi, which flows eastward into the mist in the upper register."
Hundred_Layers_of_Ink,"For a decade between 1989 and 1999, Yang Jiechang worked on the series Hundred Layers of Ink, to which this painting belongs. It is the result of focused repetition: Yang applied ink to the same piece of paper, day after day, until the rectangle at its center was completely saturated. As the paper reaches saturation, the ink takes on a shimmery, luminescent quality, and the paper itself shifts from a two-dimensional surface to a three-dimensional object, merging figure and ground, coming close to sculpture. Though these are the same materials used by literati to make traditional paintings, Yang has reinvented them here, removing entirely the artist’s gesture as an index of meaning."
Plum_blossoms,"This ambitious handscroll is the surviving masterpiece of Lu Fu, a specialist in plum-blossom painting who lived and worked in Suzhou during the early sixteenth century. Delicate flowers cascade across a surface more than twenty feet in length, offering an up-close view of a horizontal slice of a plum tree in full bloom. With great precision, the artist reserved unpainted paper for the blossoms against a background of icy blue. The scroll is also a remarkably complete artifact of friendship among elite Suzhou society. Commissioned by a man named Zhang Ling to commemorate an afternoon spent with the famed scholar Shen Zhou (1427–1509), the scroll is inscribed by several of the most celebrated men of sixteenth-century Suzhou, including Shen, Tang Yin (1470–1524), and Wen Zhengming (1470–1559)."
Fisherman_and_family,"Images of family life are relatively rare in premodern Chinese painting. This glimpse into the simple existence of a fisherman and his family aboard their small skiff was no doubt romanticized by the painter, whose style suggests a sophisticated artist working in the urban environs of Hangzhou rather than someone painting from observation along a countryside waterway. This painting presents the fisherman and his family as sincere and hardworking, their lives untouched by the vicissitudes of officialdom."
Visiting_Red_Cliff,"Premodern poems have remained important subjects for painters into the modern and contemporary periods. Art historian and artist Xu Bangda painted this homage to Su Shi’s poems on Red Cliff in 1941, in the midst of World War II."
Fragrance_Permeating_Three_Paths,"Miu Guying specialized in chrysanthemums. In his inscription on this very finely drawn fan, he traces the history of line drawing from Li Gonglin's (1049–1106) figure drawing and landscapes through Shen Zhou (1427–1509) and Tang Yin (1470–1523), who used the technique for chrysanthemums.The Song roots of Miu's descriptive drawing and his scrupulous fidelity to the forms and structure of his subject call attention to China's own realist tradition, which remained alive as an ideal, alongside China's fascination with Western realism."
Scholars_in_the_Orchid_Pavilion_Gathering,"In an unconventional move, Wu Wei employed the album format to create a close-up portrayal of individual participants in the famous Orchid Pavilion Gathering. Each painting features a single scholar sitting by a stream, on which float lotus leaves carrying wine cups. The swaying plants and the lively contour lines of the drapery capture the gentle stirring in the air. The men’s varied postures and activities reveal their temperaments and moods. Two appear absorbed, one contemplating the flowing water and the other an unfurled scroll. Another scholar is caught at a moment of distraction: ready to write with a brush lifted high in his right hand, he seems to have turned suddenly to gaze to his left. Most provocatively, a smiling man leans back on his arms, exposing his bared chest and protruding belly in total disregard of social decorum, a pose that epitomizes the free spirit of the event."
Dish_with_peonies,The deep carving of the peonies and leaves in this small dish is typical of Chinese lacquerware produced in the first half of the fourteenth century. A similar example dated before 1333 was recovered during the 1976–84 excavation of a famous shipwreck off the Sinan Islands near the southwestern coast of Korea.
Su_Wu_Tending_Sheep_as_Lady_Wang_Zhaojun_Passes_By,"This extraordinary composition combines into a continuous narrative the stories of two historical figures separated by time and geography. They have in common a long exile in the Mongolian wilderness, the site of conflict between the nomadic Xiongnu people and Han China (206 B.C.–A.D. 220). Su Wu (ca. 140–ca. 60 B.C.), pictured with grazing goats in the lower right, went to the Xiongnu as an imperial envoy in 100 B.C. Upon refusing to shift his allegiance, he was banished to Lake Baikal in modern Siberia to herd rams. Holding his emissary staff, he gazes across a frigid river at a female rider surrounded by nomadic horsemen. She is Wang Zhaojun (ca. 52–ca. 15 B.C.), chosen (through trickery) to be married off to the Xiongnu chieftain to cement a political alliance in 33 B.C. Su Wu eventually returned home, after nineteen years, but Zhaojun died in the foreign land."
Chrysanthemum,"Xügu's fresh, unstudied brushwork imparts vitality to this unkempt cluster of blossoms that neither grows in a recognizable manner nor appears to be gathered into any arrangement beyong the demands of pictorial design."
Turquoise_Grapes_and_Insects,"Ma Jin studied painting with Jin Cheng in Peking and specialized in the fine brush style of horse painting introduced by Lan Shining (Guiseppe Castiglione, 1688–1766). He was a man of many talents, including flower and bird painting, and excelled in the making of kites.In his inscription he explains that this work was a joint effort, others adding the mantis, the mosquito and the grapes to the painting."
Album_of_Seal_Carvings_by_Fu_Baoshi,"The art of seal carving has a history of more than two thousand years in China, and finely carved examples bearing personal names, official titles, or poetic phrases have long been collected and admired as a special form of calligraphy. Fu Baoshi began taking commissions for seal carvings while still in high school to help his family after his father’s death, and he continued to carve seals for himself and others throughout his life. His design sensibility is shown in the imaginative interplays between figure and ground that are inherent to seal carving.The creation of albums of seal impressions also has a long history. Within this genre, collections of seal impressions belonging to individual artists have served as catalogues of their carving skills as well as a reference for comparison with examples on extant works of art."
Lotus,"Like many other scholars of his time, Wu Xizai was actively engaged in reconstructing the past to fit discoveries made through study of authentic bronze and stone inscriptions. Appreciation for carved script styles deepened as the historical value of Han and Six Dynasties stones called into question later brush written model books. Wu Xizai brought an aesthetic preference for firm, sustained brushwork into his seal carving and painting. His elegant seal cutting style, seen in the two cinnabar-ink impressions that follow his inscription on this painting, was greatly admired by Wu Changshi (1844–1927)."
Plum_Blossoms,"Wang Yaoqing, a Peking Opera performer and teacher was given a title and frequently performed at Court. Several of the foremost players of female roles were his students. A talented painter like many Peking Opera performers, Wang Yaoqing particularly enjoyed painting traditional literati subjects, such as this plum branch. In the early decades of the century, many friendships were shared by painters and Peking Opera Performers."
Bamboo,"Wu Hufan was the grandson of Wu Dacheng, whose painting opens this exhibition. Wu Hufan drew on his family's extensive collection of paintings, calligraphy and seal carving for study of the orthodox masters—the Four Wangs of Qing, Dong Qichang (17th century), and earlier Song and Yuan painters. He was one of the most respected connoisseurs in 20th century China.His subject in this fan is a literati favorite, bamboo: its value as a symbol is that it bends without breaking while artistically, it reflects every movement of the painter's brush in its demand for calligraphic line."
Settling_Accounts_with_a_Traitor,"The Modern Woodcut Movement is an important but understudied chapter in the history of twentieth-century Chinese art. The movement was initiated by Lu Xun (1881–1936), the father of modern Chinese literature and an incisive cultural critic, who saw woodcut as the ideal medium for rousing what he saw as a complacent China from its slumber to face up to the challenges of the modern world. Easily produced from inexpensive materials and with relatively limited training, woodcut was seen as a counterpoint to the precious erudition of literati landscape painting. The medium was used extensively during the 1930s and ‘40s—by both Communist and Nationalist leaders—to disseminate political messages in a graphically impactful, legible form. Some of the most iconic vignettes from the War of Resistance (against Japan, 1937–45) and the Chinese Civil War (1945–49) were produced in this medium. The current set of prints were produced in the Communist milieu—at Yan’an, the mountain stronghold in northern Shaanxi Province that served as the capital of the Communist government during the 1940s."
Chen_Zi’ang_Testing_a_Zither,"The poet Chen Zi'ang (659–700) traveled to the capital of the Tang dynasty to pursue his career but was frustrated by his inability to gain recognition for his talents. One day in the marketplace, he came upon someone selling an ancient zither for an incredibly high price. After testing it, Chen paid 1,000 ingots of silver to purchase it. Turning to the many curious onlookers, he remarked, ""I am a good zither player. Come to my place tomorrow, and I will play for you."" The next day, a large crowd gathered at Chen's residence to hear him perform. In front of this audience, Chen suddenly smashed the zither and said, ""Entertaining people is the work of slaves. How can I do that?"" He then took out his poems and passed them around. Everyone was astonished by Chen's behavior, and his brilliance immediately became widely known.This handscroll is a masterful demonstration of Huang Shen's skill at rendering a broad range of figure types and social classes in a dashing, spontaneous manner. Huang's status as a professional painter must have made this story particularly appealing to him."
Lotus,"This colorful lotus fan was painted by Zhuang Yaofu as a gift. An elegant silhouette, a strikingly foreshortened curling leaf and delicate line mark the accomplished brush style of this woman painter."
A_Diplomatic_Mission_to_the_Jin,"After the Jurchen Jin conquered northern China in 1127, the Chinese court fled from Kaifeng to the southern city of Hangzhou. To maintain peace on the northern border of their shrunken empire, the Chinese paid annual tributes amounting to 200,000 taels of silver and 200,000 bolts of silk.Although there is no inscription to confirm it, the theme of this scroll may be the Song envoys meeting those of the Jin. Painters under the Jin continued the styles of the Northern Song, albeit with modifications. In contrast to the dramatic scale of the massive peaks in Northern Song painting, the forms here stress surface abstraction; the mountains are softened with green wash and the valleys are laced with mist."
The_Sixteen_Luohans,"Best known for his paintings rendered in brilliant mineral colors, Qiu Ying sometimes worked in ink alone to demonstrate his skill as a draftsman. In this dynamic procession of luohans and their attendants, the figures are enlivened through exquisitely controlled, undulating and folded brush lines and luminous graded washes. Qiu's enthusiasm for detail is evident in the remarkable individualization of the holy men's eccentric features and the delicate textile designs of their robes. Although the artist's inscription credits the monk-artist Guanxiu (832–912) as the source of his inspiration, the ninth-century master's grotesque luohans have here been replaced by elegant Sinicized ascetics.Reflecting the blending of Buddhism and Confucianism in later Chinese culture, this procession of luohans is shown ceremoniously escorting a Chinese scholar—identifiable by his tall cap and full robes—and his retinue out of the clouds."
"Set_of_Fan_Paintings
Mist_and_Clouds_at_Mount_Taihua",This undated painting comes from a set of twelve fan paintings now in the Cleveland Museum of Art. The remaining works from this set are on display in the last gallery of the exhibition.
"Narcissus_and_Rock,_after_Chen_Hongshou","In making his copy, Xie also transcribed Chen Hongshou's inscription: ""[I,] Hongshou, painted this for my friend, Jimeng, while staying at his home."""
"Blossoming_Plum_and_Large_Rock,_after_Chen_Hongshou","The simplified, angular lines of this tracing indicate that Xie was more interested in working out the compositional layout of his model than in making a precise replica."
Flowers,"This decorative work of the Piling school of flower painting compares closely to signed works by the late-fourteenth-century painter Lü Jingfu. Originally one of a matching pair of panels, the painting shows butterflies and a praying mantis flying amid a late-spring bouquet of poppies, asters, Chinese pinks, and chrysanthemums; a salamander in the center foreground is flanked by an orchid on the left and a cabbage on the right. The flowers and insects are flawlessly executed in fine precise brushwork and colored in delicate hues of pink, white, green, and purple, with malachite green and powder-white highlights.Similar motifs are found on blue-and-white ceramics and other decorative arts of the period where floral elements appear with frogs, salamanders, praying mantises, and cicadas. The salamander, when shown with a praying mantis devouring a cicada, symbolizes cyclical predation in nature and echoes a famous passage from the Zhuangzi: ""Creatures are so enmeshed in nature, one species always preying on another."" The popularity of such motifs in fourteenth-century art seems to reflect the political climate of the time, when China, ruled by the Mongols, was beset by repression and injustice."
Grand_View_of_Mountains_and_Rivers,"Dai Jin was the most talented and versatile landscape painter of the early fifteenth century. His gifts were recognized by multiple Ming emperors, who invited him to serve as official painter at the imperial court. In this ambitious handscroll, appropriately titled Grand View of Mountains and Rivers, Dai revels in his mastery of multiple styles. Some of these are identifiable, such as the layered horizontal dots of the Mi family style near the beginning and the angular axe-cut textured strokes of Xia Gui near the end, but others are more composite. Though Dai often painted in the manner of earlier masters, this is a rare work that combines multiple brush modes into a single, grandly conceived composition."
Divinities_of_the_Planets_and_Constellations,"The subject and imagery of this painting are derived from a composition attributed to the Tang dynasty (618–907) artist Liang Lingzan that is now in the collection of the Osaka Municipal Museum of Art. The painting depicts the deities of the Five Planets, which correspond to the five primary elements—wood (Jupiter), fire (Mars), earth (Saturn), metal (Venus), and water (Mercury)—and the twenty-eight constellations of the Chinese zodiac.Qiu Ying, a fine artist in his own right, was also famous as a skilled copyist of earlier paintings. Such copies were highly valued by collectors and other artists who might not have access to the originals. This painting bears the signature and seals of Qiu Ying but may itself be a later copy."
Grooms_and_Foreign_Horses,"Jin Nong, a noted scholar, connoisseur, and calligrapher, took up painting around the age of fifty after his failure, in 1736, to be recruited as an official. Jin's paintings of horses, dated examples of which all come from 1760–61, are a poignant expression of his frustrated political ambitions, as he makes clear in his accompanying poems, which draw upon the well-established metaphor that an aptitude for recognizing fine horses was akin to an ability to judge and select men for government service.In this powerfully eccentric painting, Jin's intentionally awkward and self-consciously archaic revival of a composition and theme associated with Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322), a Chinese scholar whose service under the Mongols led to a number of positive reforms, makes clear Jin's aspiration to perform a similar function under the Manchu Qing dynasty. Inscribed with a poem that bemoans the absence of a worthy judge of horses, the painting is a thinly veiled lament that expresses the artist's feelings of being misunderstood and unappreciated:I happened to see a painting of foreign horses by a man of the Yuan dynasty. I made a copy of it while a guest and inscribed a poem:Bathed three times in the Dragon Pool, yearly they galloped out,With futile ambition they rushed to respond to their lord's will.Now led to the red gates of the wealthy, where a high price is asked,What man, with a single look, could make them worth a thousand tales?"
Riverbank,"During the chaotic years following the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907, centralized rule was shattered and China splintered into a number of short-lived kingdoms. Among the most important of these was the Southern Tang dynasty (937–75), which governed much of the lower Yangzi River delta from its capital at Nanjing. It was there that a distinctive “southern” style of landscape painting developed under the court official and artist Dong Yuan.Riverbank epitomizes Dong Yuan’s new style, with its absence of contour lines and use of subtle ink washes and soft-rubbed texture strokes to describe the distinctive rounded hills and earthen slopes of southeastern China. The depiction of a scholar-hermit living in elegant reclusion likewise established a lasting thematic ideal. Darkened with age, the scroll, the tallest of all surviving early Chinese landscape paintings, marks the majestic inception of the monumental landscape tradition.The scroll was split in two along its vertical seam during the fourteenth century. The left-hand side of the composition, with its tall foreground trees backed by an impenetrable screen of thrusting and twisting mountain forms, inspired a major revival of the Dong Yuan style among scholar-artists of the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368)."
Heart_Sutra,"A self-taught calligrapher and seal-carver, Fung made this pair of hanging scrolls as a meditation on the content of the widely known Buddhist text the Heart Sutra. In both scrolls, Fung has transcribed the same text, but in each case he has taken advantage of the special qualities of paper and ink to intensify the scripture’s message, that form and emptiness are one and the same. On one scroll Fung wrote the text in pale ink. On the other, he first wrote the text in water. This text only became visible when he applied a layer of dark ink over it, resulting in ghostlike traces where the water-saturated paper only partially absorbed the ink."
Marvelous_Verses_without_Sounds,"This ethereal album is an example of the “three perfections” (sanjue 三絕), the combination of painting, poetry, and calligraphy into a cohesive work of art. For scholarly artists like Xiao Yuncong, a successful expression of the three perfections was considered the greatest achievement, a creative act that revealed the depth of the artist’s learning and refinement. Xiao lived through the fall of the Ming dynasty, and his melancholy poems inscribed here express his desire for reclusion from a world that he saw as irrevocably damaged. The artist’s weighty poetry contrasts with his gossamer-light application of silvery ink and his surprising, sometimes humorous compositions, such as the man washing his feet in a stream."
Couplet_by_Han_Yu,"This writing is related to the regular script style of Emperor Gaozong (r. 1127–62) but is quite different from that of Emperor Lizong (r. 1224–64). The closest stylistic comparison is a transcription of the Diamond Sutra by the Song courtier Zhang Jizhi (1186–1266) written in the same large regular script and dated 1246. While no extant work by Guangzong is known, this writing may prove to be by his hand. The couplet is taken from the poem New Bamboo by the great Tang writer Han Yu (768–824):[The bamboo's] lofty appearance defies the austerity of autumn,Its chaste color surpasses the lush beauty of spring.(Wen C.

Landscape_in_the_Style_of_Zhao_Boju_(Fang_Zhao_Boju_shanshui),"This painting is Wang Hui’s second earliest extant work. Done barely two years into his apprenticeship under the preeminent master Wang Shimin (1592–1680), it shows an approach that differs entirely from that of his earliest known work of 1650 and reflects his exposure to the region’s great collections of ancient masters.According to Wang’s inscription, the painting follows the style of Zhao Boju (died ca. 1162), a Southern Song academy painter known for his landscapes in the blue-and-green style. The calligraphic contour lines and texture dots of Wang’s interpretation, however, owe more to Wang Shimin than to the twelfth-century master.One year before his death Wang added a second inscription:This painting was done in my youth; suddenly, more than sixty years have gone by. Seeing it now I am ashamed of my first steps."
Dragon_and_Landscape,"This scroll presents a view of undulating billows and a rocky shoreline where several gnarled trees cling to a bare cliff. To the left of the trees two dragons appear amid the clouds and inky darkness. The dragons' writhing bodies and hooked claws contrast with the angular planes of the rock faces and echo the twisted trunks and clinging roots of the trees. One dragon seems to emerge from the rock itself, while the other is depicted playfully, stretched belly up across a rocky incline.This short, abruptly cropped composition was originally part of a much longer handscroll, other fragments of which are now in Japan and in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Compared with Chen Rong's Nine Dragons handscroll of 1244, also in Boston, the brushwork of this scroll is much coarser, suggesting that it was painted by a later follower."

Frogs_Under_Banana_Tree,This virtuoso woodblock reproduction of a painting by Qi Baishi was made by the Rong Bao Zhai studio in Beijing. To reproduce Qi's powerful composition—a lush banana tree towering over playful frogs—the printers used multiple woodblocks and carefully controlled their inking to capture the full range of wet to dry brushwork and the subtle shifts in ink tonality found in the original.
Returning_Home_in_a_Driving_Rain,"This composition, formerly attributed to Xia Gui, depicts two farmers struggling to return home in a summer downpour. Although the drawing of the angry cliff face and dancing tree leaves is extremely skillful, the effect is somewhat theatrical. The round brushwork, while deriving from Xia Gui, is from a different hand, probably that of a close follower."
Viewing_the_Moon_under_a_Pine_Tree,"This painting, formerly attributed to the leading court artist Ma Yuan, repeats the motifs and brushwork for which Ma was famous. A scholar seated beneath a great pine tree holds a zither in his lap, while a young attendant dozes nearby. Although the work lacks the psychic energy of Ma Yuan's paintings, the relaxed yet forceful round brushwork suggests the hand of an early and close follower of the master."
Winter_landscape,"Little is known about the Nanjing artist Jiang Song except that he descended from a family of imperial physicians and officials but chose to support himself as a professional painter. Concentrating on a limited repertoire of images—lone fishermen, scholars living in reclusion, and mountain travelers—all of which appear in this work, Jiang's paintings are noteworthy for their dramatically abstracted landscape forms, dashing brushwork, subtly graded washes, and bold contrasts in ink tone in the manner of Shi Zhong (1438–ca. 1517), another Nanjing painter known for his bravura snowscapes. This unsigned painting is attributed to Jiang Song on the basis of its similarity to a set of four short paintings now in the East Asian Art Museum, Berlin."
Chicken_cup,"This type of small, bowl-shaped vessel from the imperial kiln of the mid-Ming dynasty has been cherished as the pinnacle of fine Chinese porcelain. The decoration was achieved through a complicated process. First, the design was drawn in cobalt blue on the unfired vessel. After glazing and high-temperature firing, the images were filled in with overglaze enamel pigments and then it was fired at a lower temperature to bring out the vibrant colors. Known as “chicken cups” for their imagery, these vessels convey a core Chinese value: nurturing the young is essential for the continuation of the family line."
Birds_Amidst_Blossoming_Plum_and_Bamboo,"Identified by the white patch on their heads as ""whitehaired oldsters"" (baitou weng), the birds in this painting are auspicious symbols of longevity. Combined with the plum and bamboo—symbols of moral virtue and renewal—the painting would have made a fitting gift for a birthday or anniversary celebration."
The_Eighteen_Luohans,"In the seventeenth century, Ding Yunpeng became famous for his fantastical depictions of luohans. This scroll bears a signature by Ding, but the figures’ facial shapes and the fluttering, gossamer-light brushwork suggest that it is a nineteenth-century copy. At the far left side of the scroll near the top, the artist finished the composition with an exquisitely-drawn dragon descending on clouds, about to be tamed by the seated luohan who opens his mouth to call the beast to heel."
"Orchids_in_Rain,_after_Wen_Zhengming,_Leaf_from_the_Ten_Bamboo_Studio_Collection_of_Calligraphy_and_Painting,_vol._2","The model for this print, according to the inscription, was a painting by Wen Zhengming (1470–1559), a leading artist active in Suzhou. Printed from a worn eighteenth-century block, it shows broken lines and blurred contours."
Struggle_on_the_Front_Line,"Created during the Cultural Revolution, this print from the politically charged series The Furnace Fire Is Even Redder illustrates the production of iron and steel in the Angang model factory in Liaoning Province, in northeast China. The Angang Constitution, enacted in 1960 for the corporation’s management, embodied the Communist ideology regarding shared labor among all personnel. Here, a manager and a manual laborer work together at the furnace.Typical of Cultural Revolution graphic art in the 1970s, heroic figures are placed at the center of a large, dramatic composition. The predominant red color is symbolic of Communist zeal and also represents a realistic rendering of the workplace."
Ode_on_Returning_Home,"Qian Xuan was a celebrated Song loyalist who, following the Mongol conquest, supported himself through painting. Toward the end of his life, however, he complained that his works were being forged. Here, both the calligraphy and painting are modeled closely on Qian's style, suggesting that the work is a faithful copy.Qian's composition was inspired by Tao Qian's (365–427) poem ""Returning Home,"" written in 405 after Tao resigned from public office. In it, Tao expresses his preference for poverty over the compromises and constraints of official life, establishing forever the ideal of the home and garden as a personal retreat. Clearly, Qian saw Tao's poem as a reflection of his own life in reclusion. Using the archaic ""blue-and-green"" style in a new, purposefully naive manner, he created a dreamlike environment that exists outside the realm of temporal troubles. His poem, written to the left of the picture, is both an appreciation of Tao and an expression of his state of mind:In front of his gate he plants five willows,By the eastern fence, he picked chrysanthemums.In his long chant is a lingering purity,There is never enough wine to sustain him.To live in this world it is necessary to become deeply drunk,To take office would only bring shame.In a moment of inspiration he composes ""Returning Home""The poem of one thousand years."
Nomads_hunting_with_falcons,"Chen Zhuzhong specialized in depicting nomadic horsemen and their lives on the steppes. This exquisite fan painting, in which the hairstyles, costumes, and saddle trappings of the Khitan people are faithfully rendered, may be dated stylistically to Chen's period of activity or somewhat later. The horseman galloping away in pursuit of his quarry recalls a similar figure in Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute."
River_Village_in_Autumn_Dawn,"Zhao Lingrang (also known as Zhao Danian), a scion of the Song imperial family, was forbidden by dynastic statutes to travel any distance from the capital; he therefore painted mostly intimate, local, suburban scenery. As a collector, Zhao learned painting by studying ancient masterworks rather than the often wild nature of northern China, as did his great contemporaries such as Guo Xi (ca. 1000–ca. 1090). Turning his limitations into a virtue, Zhao strove to capture the mood of single lyrical moments with all their particular qualities, thereby presaging the more intimate ""mind landscapes"" of the Southern Song and Yuan periods."
"Lotus_Flowers,_Leaf_from_the_Mustard_Seed_Garden_Painting_Manual,_part_3","Parts 2 and 3 of the Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual were compiled in 1701 by Wang Gai and his brothers (or nephews) Wang Shi and Wang Nie. These visually appealing sections reproduce colorful, animated images of flowers, plants, birds, and insects. Closely imitating real paintings, these prints often combine pictorial imagery with the calligraphy and seals of the artists who made the designs. The precise contours and chromatic variations attest to the superb craftsmanship of the carver and the printer."
Three_scenes_from_festivals_of_the_twelve_months,"These two paintings almost certainly once belonged to a set of hanging scrolls or a multipanel screen. While the complete suite may or may not have illustrated a continuous narrative, this pair clearly relates to legendary immortals honored in seasonal festivals.The painting on the left depicts the Qixi Festival that celebrates the rendezvous of a cowherd and a weaver maiden on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. Having been banished to opposite sides of the Milky Way, they reunite on a sky bridge formed by a flock of magpies, as seen in the scroll’s top register. The couple holding hands in a lavish garden setting in the foreground may refer to the Tang emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–56) and his lover Yang Guifei (719–756), who famously pledged their eternal love on this night.The painting on the right illustrates the physical and spiritual ascension of the lunar goddess Chang’e from her earthly home to the moon, which is celebrated at the Mid-Autumn Festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month. A blue circular portal in the upper register reveals the newly arrived goddess in a red robe enjoying music in celestial company. The white rabbit in front, working a mortar and pestle to make an elixir, is a mythical denizen of the moon."
Two_Birds_on_a_Wintry_Tree,"Two magpies, their feathers fluffed up against the cold, represent a warm reminder of the inevitability of spring. Such pictures of paired birds were often given as birthday gifts to elderly couples. The white heads of the birds and their long tail feathers are symbols of longevity, as is the ancient tree upon which they perch, for despite being covered with snow, the tree has already sprouted new growth—a sign of its enduring vigor."
Woman_in_a_garden,"During his tragically short life, Ren Xiong produced some of the most striking and innovative paintings of the nineteenth century. In this image of a dignified woman sitting in a garden, the contrast between the broad strokes used for the setting and the meticulous treatment of the face creates an eerie effect, imparting an unsettling vitality to the figure. Ren’s paintings often reveal an interest in patterning, such as the swirls on the mat that covers the rock. Few paintings by the artist survive, but he was much admired and emulated; this might be by a follower of the next generation."
Meeting_between_Yaoshan_and_Li_Ao,"This painting was inscribed by the Chan (Zen) Buddhist priest Yanxi Guangwen between 1254 and 1256, while he was abbot of Lingyin temple in Hangzhou. The work is an important example of early Chan Buddhist ""apparition"" painting, so called for its pale, sensitive brushwork.Depicted here is a famous encounter between the Confucian scholar Li Ao (active ca. 840) and the Chan master Yaoshan. Having heard of the master's reputation, the scholar went to see him but was disappointed and remarked: ""Seeing your face is not as good as hearing your name."" The master replied: ""Would you distrust your eye and value your ear?"" Then, pointing up and down, the master indicated that the ultimate reality is in what can be seen, such as ""clouds in the sky and water in a vase.""Yanxi Guangwen's inscription on the painting reads:All moments of enlightenment come in a flash,Why distrust your eye and value your ear?Just as between the water and the clouds,Do not say there is nothing there.Just as the Chan master used riddles to sharpen the student's perception in spite of distracting hearsay, the Chan painter used a simple and spontaneous, albeit elusive, brush style to capture his fleeting vision of truth."
Lady_in_a_bamboo_grove,"Qiu Ying was a professional painter who lived and worked in Suzhou during the city’s flourishing sixteenth century. At the time, social divisions between educated elites and professional painters could sometimes be difficult to cross, but Qiu Ying managed to mix with the circle of Wen Zhengming despite the fact that he did not share their extensive literary training. This painting of a woman in a bamboo grove typifies Qiu’s ability to paint with polished, meticulous brushwork while still maintaining the atmosphere of understated elegance that appealed to his scholarly friends."
Fish_at_play,"During the reign (1101–25) of Emperor Huizong, the cultivation of rare aquarium fish came into vogue, and playful, splashing fish in plant-filled waters became a popular subject. In the Xuanhe huapu (preface dated 1120), the catalogue of Huizong’s painting collection, the author of the essay ""Fishes and Dragons” decries still-life representations of fish as “objects on a kitchen table” but praises pictures of fish that “play in the wide expanse and dive in the deep.” In Fish at Play, where six slim, nimble fish flip and weave through the grasses, the painter’s genius for suggesting life and movement by the graceful deployment of elegant, curving lines is fully in evidence. Flawlessly executed, the image is at once a metaphor for and a re-creation of natural life at its freest and most spontaneous."
Palace_ladies_bathing_children,"Depictions of the daily life of court ladies became a special genre of painting under the influence of the eighth-century painter Zhou Fang and his tenth-century follower Zhou Wenju. Painting in a richly detailed manner in which even the fabric patterns are meticulously described, these two artists had an important influence on the figure style practiced by the Song Painting Academy. This painting closely follows Tang dynasty (618–907) prototypes: the tight group of figures arrayed in an oval and set against a blank background is a typical Tang style composition; the hesitant brushwork, however, suggests that it is a later copy, probably done in the Northern Song period."
Windswept_lakeshore,"The Southern Song artist, eschewing the Northern Song monumental landscape traditions of ""a hundred peaks and ten thousand trees,"" viewed nature through the microcosm of a single pair of trees and one or two rocks suspended in an infinite void. In this scene of unbounded space, vigorous wet-ink lines and dots against broad flat sweeps of ink wash define forms with startling boldness."
Dragon_Boat_Regatta_on_Jinming_Lake,"Dragon boat races are traditionally held on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month to commemorate the death of the virtuous minister Qu Yuan (343–277 B.C.), who drowned himself to refute slander. Depicted here is a race sponsored by Emperor Huizong (r. 1101–25) on the third day of the third month, on Jinming (""Golden Bright"") Lake, which was located in an imperial park at the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng.The picture is a remarkable example of jiehua, or ""ruled-line,"" painting, the intricate style of depicting architecture perfected by Wang Zhenpeng. According to the inscription, Wang executed this painting in 1323 for the Grand Elder Princess Sennge (ca. 1283–1331), the older sister of Emperor Renzong (r. 1312–20), after a similar composition he had painted for Renzong in 1310.A powerful figure in the Mongol court, Princess Sennge was one of the foremost art collectors of the age, and her seals appear on many early paintings and calligraphies. Two of her seals are impressed on the Metropolitan scroll: one in the upper-right corner of the painting, the other following Wang's inscription. The weak carving of the legends and the harsh color of the seal paste, however, suggestthat both seals are forgeries. The stiffness of Wang's clerical-script inscription also marks it as a copy. The subject was immensely popular—at least five other versions of this composition exist. The Metropolitan's painting appears to be a later fourteenth-century copy of Wang's famous composition."
The_Sixteen_Luohans,"Chen Xian was a Buddhist monk who painted mostly religious figures. In the chaos that accompanied the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, many Buddhist monks left China for Japan, and some brought paintings by Chen, which found favor. For this reason, he is better known in Japan than in his native country. This album is not as accomplished as his best works—the shading of the faces is somewhat muddy—so it is likely a close copy, possibly by a Japanese admirer."
Ducks_and_Reeds,"One of the leading court painters of bird-and-flower painting, the Cantonese artist Lin Liang specialized in bold, expressive monochrome depictions of birds in the wild."
Lotuses_on_a_summer_evening,"Lotuses, a tour de force of ""boneless"" (color washes with no ink outlines) painting on paper, shows Yun as the most brilliant and subtle colorist of his time. Although the depiction recalls the realism of Song Painting Academy flower paintings, the artist insists in his colophon that he ""merely followed the inclination of [his] brushwork in making dots and washes, benefiting from exhilarating accidents and not searching for physical verisimilitude."""
Orchid_and_rock,"In sixteenth-century China, courtesans played an active role in elite society. Extensive literary education was relatively rare among women, and even those fortunate enough to receive it almost never had the chance to display their gifts in public. Courtesans, by contrast, were celebrated for their talents in literature, painting, and music, and they participated in scholarly gatherings. Ma Shouzhen was one of the most famous of these; she mixed freely with the literary luminaries of Suzhou and Nanjing and carried on a long-term romance with the poet Wang Zhideng. Because of her fame, Ma’s paintings were much copied; this is likely one such homage, made in the generation or two after her death."
Flower_and_Bee,"This reproduction of a Zhao Shao'ang painting represents the high artistry of traditional woodblock printing. To a nonspecialist, this print could easily be mistaken for a painting. The printers have carefullycontrolled the amount and density of ink and pigment applied to the blocks to capture the varying shades of color in Zhao's original. Particularly notable is the layering of the peony's petals and its twisting leaves. The sense of tension between the heavy flower and the drooping branch—accentuated by the arrival of a honeybee—is vividly conveyed."
Bamboo_in_a_spring_thunderstorm,"This fan purports to be by the Ming dynasty artist Tang Yin (with a spurious date of 1522), but the brushwork of the painting and the calligraphy indicate that it is a copy by an artist of the seventeenth century. Nevertheless, it is a fine example of bamboo painting, in which multiple tones of ink have been used to suggest depth among the leaf-laden stalks. The poem describes a spring thunderstorm that stirs bamboo before giving way to a clear, moonlit night:The crash of spring thunder sets the lush bamboo moving,Sweeping the ground with its dragon whiskers and long phoenix tails.Looking up from below the curtain I play my flute,The bright moon fills the sky, shining on the Xiao and Xiang Rivers.—Translation by Richard M. Barnhart"
Pair_of_inscribed_tea_caddies,"This pair of perfectly matched tea caddies appears to be a rare example of the handiwork of the renowned early Qing pewter artist Shen Cunzhou. When placed side-by-side, the twin caddies form a single unit with no visible adornment other than the gently protruding flanges at the center of each side. Only when separated does one see that the flat “inside” surfaces have each been incised with texts. The base of each caddy also bears a poem. The texts, by noted literary figures of the Tang (618-907), Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1271-1368) dynasties, all celebrate the joys of living in harmony with nature. By cleverly concealing these texts, the caddies exemplify the literati ideal of inner cultivation. The understated design and extraordinary craftsmanship of these humble objects exemplify the refined taste and innovative spirit of the period"

The style of the painting, however, with its convincing treatment of diagonal recession, use of the ""ax-cut"" texture strokes of Li Tang (ca. 1070–ca. 1150), and broad sweeps of ink wash on the eroded riverbanks, indicates a late-twelfth-century date."

Garden_Flowers,"Following Shen Zhou’s (1427–1509) example of treating still-life painting as uninhibited “ink plays,” Chen Chun strove to turn his flower paintings into spontaneous “idea writings.” Realistic flower paintings had been a popular subject since at least the tenth century, and Chen Chun was perhaps the greatest exponent of this genre in his time.

Plucking_Chrysanthemums,"This painting is a copy of a work by the writer-artist Zhang Feng. The original, a birthday gift for a friend, was executed on the eve of the Double Ninth Festival—the ninth day of the ninth lunar month—when tradition called for ascending the heights and drinking chrysanthemum wine. Zhang's subject matter was undoubtedly inspired by the occasion, but it also pays tribute to the poet Tao Qian (365–427), who was renowned both for his rejection of an official position and for his love of chrysanthemums and wine. He depicts the chrysanthemum's most famous admirer enjoying the bouquet of a plant that has grown in the company of rocks and bamboo—symbols of a life in reclusion, which, on a different level, can be construed as congratulatory wishes for long life.Zhang's two poems read:In the light rain of this clear autumn,Today is your birthday.With the Double Ninth Festival just around the corner,I should first search out a chrysanthemum for you.So much have I learned as I grow older,Now is the time to put myself on strong foundations.With a deep draught of wine,[I contemplate the paradises lying to] the west and south,Their powerful radiance is indestructible."

Couplet_on_pond_scenery,"The individual brush mannerisms of this couplet, though stylistically related to the calligraphy of Emperor Gaozong (1107–1187), to whom it has traditionally been attributed, compare most closely with those found in Eulogy on Calligraphy by Gaozong's son, Xiaozong. This attribution is supported by the fan's three-character dedication to [Zhao] Zhizhong, a eunuch in Xiaozong's service. The imperial seal impressed over the dedication that reads ""Treasure of imperial writing,"" as well as the unequal spacing between characters in the right-hand line, a feature that reveals a degree of spontaneity in execution unlikely from a scribe, further corroborate the conclusion that this piece is from the emperor's own hand.The couplet describes the stillness of a pond at evening:Above the pond, a thin mist envelops theemerald green;At water's edge, the late sun plays withdragonflies."
"Rock,_Tiger_Lily_and_Orchid","Zhao Wenchu (born Wen Shu) was a fourth-generation descendant of the Suzhou luminary Wen Zhengming. Like most members of the family—men and women—she received a first-rate classical education. Many women painters of the Ming dynasty focused on floral themes; for some, this may have been a preference, but others were likely guided toward this genre because of the association of women with gardens and blossoms. A lack of refinement in the brushwork of this example suggests that it may be by one of the many later painters who produced works in Zhao’s style."
Nine_Songs,"The Nine Songs are lyrical, shamanistic incantations dedicated to nine classes of deities worshipped by the Chu people of south China during the first millennium B.C. The original text consists of eleven songs, ten of which are transcribed and illustrated here. The illustrations are preceded by a portrait of the poet Qu Yuan (343–277 B.C.), which is accompanied by an essay entitled ""The Fisherman,"" recounting the poet's state of mind toward the end of his life.Zhao Mengfu's paintings for the Nine Songs in the baimiao, or ""white-drawing"" style, are based on compositions by Li Gonglin (ca. 1041–1106) and were a primary source for later fourteenth-century paintings of this theme by Zhang Wu (active 1333–65) and others. Because the calligraphy in the album does not compare with the best of Zhao Mengfu's writing, it is probable that these leaves represent close, reliable copies of Zhao's important work, executed during the fourteenth century. One leaf, ""The Lord of Clouds,"" is a later replacement (no earlier than the seventeenth century)."
Couplet_from_Song_Zhiwen’s_poem_“Ascending_the_Pavilion_at_the_Monastery_of_Meditative_Concentration”,"Mi Wanzhong was a well-known calligrapher, painter, and connoisseur of the late Ming period who claimed descent from the eminent Northern Song artist-connoisseur Mi Fu (1052–1107). While holding the post of judicial inspector in Nanjing, Mi Wanzhong fell afoul of the notorious palace eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568–1627) and was forced to retire to his garden estate on the outskirts of Beijing in 1625. During his retirement, he whiled away the time indulging in artistic pursuits, including painting scenes of his garden on lanterns that came to be known as ""Mi family lanterns."" It was not until 1631, four years after the eunuch's death, that Mi was reappointed to government service. Moyai (monumental writing carved into cliffs) became a special art in north China during the sixth century. Here Mi Wanzhong combined the large scale of moyai with the powerful brush style of the Tang master Yan Zhenching (709–785). The couplet reads:Opening my robes, I sit at the edge of heaven,With a wave of my hand, I brush away theclouds and smoke.As a scholar-official forced out of office by a corrupt palace eunuch, Mi must have enjoyed writing these brave words in such a bold manner."
"Cranes,_peach_tree,_and_China_rose","In 1731 the court painter Shen Quan traveled to Nagasaki at the request of the Japanese government. During his nearly two years in Japan, Shen and his students produced a large number of paintings in this style—typified by bold ink brushwork for rocks and trees paired with meticulous application of color for birds and flowers—which served as an enduring inspiration to Japanese artists. This example combines cranes, peaches, and lingzhi fungus, all symbols of longevity or immortality, along with bamboo and China rose (yueji)."
Lady_Su_Hui_and_Her_Verse_Puzzle,"This scene appears in a later copy of a Tang-dynasty painting illustrating the story of a literary legend, Lady Su Hui, who was supposed to have lived in the late fourth century. The dating of the original painting is supported by the types of instruments depicted in it. Both the harp (konghou) and the pipa played with a plectrum disappeared after the Tang.Front row, left to right: qin, pipa, pipa (played without plectrum), paibanBack row, left to right: dizi, xiao, sheng, konghou"
Hermitage_by_a_pine-covered_bluff,"Yan Ciyu and his brother Yan Ciping learned to paint from their father Yan Zhong, who painted in the courts of Emperors Huizong and Gaozong of the Song dynasty. Following in their father’s footsteps, Ciyu and Ciping went on to paint for Emperor Xiaozong in the 1160s. Because there is no signature on this painting, its attribution must be made on the basis of style alone. While some have argued that its style resembles that of Ciping, the scholar and Met curator Wen Fong attributed it to his brother, Yan Ciyu."
"Buddha’s_Hand_Fruits,_after_Gao_You_(active_first_half_of_the_17th_century)_Leaf_from_the_Ten_Bamboo_Studio_Collection_of_Calligraphy_and_Painting","The Ten Bamboo Studio Collection of Calligraphy and Painting is one of the earliest color-printed picture collections in China and the first to capture the subtle nuance of brushstrokes. It is named after the Ten Bamboo Studio of the scholar Hu Zhengyan in Nanjing. Hu compiled calligraphies and paintings by past and contemporary artists, then had them carved and printed by a skilled team in eight volumes with 186 pictures and 140 matching poems. These leaves are among the earliest and finest imprints of existing versions from the original blocks."

Classic_of_Spiritual_Flight,"The copying of sutras, the sacred texts of Buddhism and Daoism, was an act of devotion as well as a means of propagating the faith. It required a special brush, paper of a conventional size with a vertical grid, and the use of the strictest, most formal script. This hallowed fragment of a Daoist religious text meets all of those requirements yet has an elegance and fluency that elevate it beyond normal sutra writing.Commissioned in 738 by Princess Yuzhen, a daughter of Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–56), this writing exemplifies the sophisticated court style of the High Tang period. The small script is balanced and harmonious, with every hook, stroke, and dot perfectly defined and executed. Applied with a stiff, long-pointed brush, each stroke shows clean, crisp movements and graceful, saber-sharp turns. Individual characters are straight, upright, and firmly built, with a rectangular frame of supports and walls. The construction of the characters reveals an analytical process: different types of brushstrokes are seen as forces (shi) in a dynamic composition, each having a perfect form and a “method” (fa) of interacting with the other strokes; each character, with its elegant, carefully considered deployment of those forces, exemplifies a model of physical equilibrium and spiritual repose.In the early seventeenth century, this sutra was acquired by the influential painter, calligrapher, and theorist Dong Qichang (1555–1636), who regarded it as one of the finest extant examples of Tang-dynasty small writing. Dong reluctantly lent the sutra to a Mr. Chen for inclusion in a set of rubbings of model calligraphies, the Bohai cangzhen, but held back twelve columns for safekeeping. Dong was justified in his apprehension; the surviving forty-three columns that we celebrate today are those that were removed from the sutra by the unscrupulous Mr. Chen."
Conversation_in_a_cave,"Although this painting bears the spurious signature of Xia Gui, the undisputed master of landscape painting in the Song Imperial Painting Academy, its motifs, brushwork, and palette relate it to the work of Ma Yuan, Xia's contemporary and the other leadingSong Academy master. Images of caves and grottoes have rich associations involving their role as possible access points to Daoist paradises. The use of such imagery here may imply an escapist wish to leave behind the cares of the mundane world."
Elegant_gathering_in_a_garden,"In a garden setting backed by a dramatically shaped and pitted rock, two gentlemen gather for elegant pursuits. As the guest reads lazily at the table, his host turns to admonish the attendants in some aspect of service. Around them are the accoutrements of the elegant gathering: an inkstone, books, scrolls of painting and calligraphy, and a zither (qin), in case musical inspiration should strike."
Pavilion_on_a_pond,"An elaborate pleasure pavilion sits on the shores of a pond. Beneath the eaves, a man is attended by servants as he sits in front of a screen; on the veranda, two men converse under a trellis by blossoming flowers. The fantastically shaped rocks, low stone bridge, and distant buildings across the water reveal that this refuge is a lavish garden: a lovingly designed simulation of nature made for human enjoyment."
White_Lotus_Society,"In 386 CE, Huiyuan, founder of the Pure Land sect of Buddhism, built a monastery at the foot of Mount Lu in Jiangxi Province. This became the meeting point for his newly founded White Lotus Society—a group of scholars and monks from China, India, and Central Asia—to discuss and debate the Buddhist faith, which was still relatively new to China. Included in the group were men now best remembered for their poetry, including Tao Yuanming and Xie Lingyun. Images of the White Lotus Society later become popular as painting subjects; this copy, likely made in the fifteenth century, purports to preserve a version by the Northern Song master Li Gonglin."
Garden_estate,"A group of gentlemen ramble throughout a vast garden estate, enjoying waterside pavilions and the company of cranes. Many gardens in premodern China were small in scale, but painted representations of them can make them seem vast—a reflection of how their makers intended them to be experienced: as places where the spirit could run free. This handsome painting bears a fake signature of the twelfth-century painter Liu Songnian, but it was likely made in the seventeenth century to satisfy market demand for old paintings."
Pear_Blossoms,"Qian Xuan was one of the first scholar-painters to unite poetry, painting, and calligraphy within a single work. In Pear Blossoms a perfect interplay of poetic and pictorial imagery has been achieved. The artist's poem may be translated as follows:All alone by the veranda railing,teardrops drenching the branches,Although her face is unadorned,her old charms remain;Behind the locked gate, on a rainy night,how she is filled with sadness.How differently she looked bathed in golden wavesof moonlight, before the darkness fell.Unlike Emperor Huizong's (r. 1101–25) Finches and Bamboo, which demonstrates a commitment to an accurate rendering of nature, Qian Xuan's flowering branch and the fading beauty it represents are expressions of the artist's personal feelings. Rather than rendering an objective description of the physical beauty of pear blossoms, Qian drew in a fine calligraphic line and used flat schematic patterns in elegant pale colors to create a mood of cool detachment, reflective of his state of mind. The tender lyricism of the poem is also fully present in his calligraphy, in which the brushstrokes echo the languidly twisting movement of the pear leaves."
Dragon_Pine_on_Mount_Huang,"This monumental work is one of the monk-painter Hongren's many portraits of the powerfully eccentric pines on Mount Huang, a scenic spot in Anhui Province. He was a guiding figure of the Anhui school of painters, whose common bond was their fascination with the rugged scenery of Mount Huang. Hongren favored a dry linear style that echoed the lofty moral character of the Yuan dynasty recluse-painter Ni Zan (1306–1374). Intense emotion lurks beneath the surface of Hongren's seemingly cool and detached style.A staunch Ming loyalist, Hongren became a Buddhist monk after the Manchu conquest of the south in 1645. His poem, inscribed on this painting, alludes to the theme of endurance and survival, long associated with the great pine:Coiled above a mountain peak, his physiqueis superb.How old is he? What man can tell?the elixir of immortality, at the beginningof time,[The pine's] dense scales and claws were alreadyfully grown."
Inscriptions_from_the_Stele_of_Mount_Yi,"In 219 B.C., on the first of many inspection tours of his vast empire, the First Emperor of Qin visited Mount Yi. He ordered that a stele be erected there, and calligraphed with a text in the newly standardized script. The text praises the emperor for bringing peace to the world by defeating Qin’s six rival states and unifying them under his rule. Although the stele was destroyed by fire during the Tang dynasty (618–907), the inscription was passed down by scholars; the present rubbings were taken from a stele that dates from the tenth century A.D. While the calligraphic style is of that era, the balanced structure and relatively uniform size of the characters derive from the seal script established by the Qin, echoing the glorious tradition of this mighty but short-lived state."
Dragon,"Dragons were believed to dwell in mysterious places—clouds, mists, watery subterranean caves—and painters used a repertoire of techniques to capture that sense of mystery. Here, the artist has painted the background with a dark ink wash. The slightly lighter dragon emerges from the primordial ooze. Lightest in tone are the beast’s arresting eyes, which accordingly jump forth from the image."
Spring_Morning_at_the_Palace_of_the_Han_Emperors,"This painting, likely made in the seventeenth century, bears a fake signature of Zhao Boju, a Southern Song painter famous for his work in the blue-green landscape mode. Here, this palette is used to evoke the distant past—a picture of antiquity as a magical, distant land."
Eight_Songs_of_the_Xiao_and_Xiang_Rivers,"In the eleventh century, an artist named Song Di painted a set of melancholy landscapes evoking the river watersheds of the Xiao and Xiang region in current-day Hunan Province, southwest China. Poets of the day responded to Song’s paintings with corresponding poems, giving rise to a tradition of Xiao-Xiang poetry and painting that continued in subsequent centuries in China and eventually extended to Japan and Korea. This rendition bears a signature of the Ming-dynasty artist Wen Zhengming, but both the calligraphy and painting lack Wen’s subtlety; it is believed to have been painted in his style after his death."
Gathering_at_the_Orchid_Pavilion,"This painting depicts the famous party held by Wang Xizhi at the Orchid Pavilion in 353 CE, when a group of scholars gathered to write poems and drink wine along the banks of a stream. Working within the intimate fan format, the artist could not spread out the stream as in a handscroll; instead, the men are clustered in the bottom half of the composition as the stream snakes around them. The host of the party sits in the pavilion at right, authoring the famous preface that would record the event for posterity."
"Morning_Glow_on_the_Western_Ridge,_from_the_series_Thirty-six_Views_of_the_Summer_Palace","This engraving presents a view of the Kangxi emperor’s (r. 1662–1722) summer palace complex in modern Chengde, Hebei Province. In 1711 the emperor composed poems on his favorite thirty-six sites and ordered the court artist Shen Yu to illustrate them. Two sets of prints were produced after the paintings, one in woodcut and the other in copperplate engraving by Matteo Ripa.Ripa was an Italian missionary working as an artist at the Manchu court. He introduced the technique of copperplate engraving to China for making pictures and maps. His engravings of the Mountain Villa are thought to have influenced the development of English garden design."
Landscape,"This painting was acquired for The Met in Beijing in 1913 by the missionary and educator-turned-art-dealer John Calvin Ferguson. Ferguson believed the painting to be by the tenth-century master Dong Yuan, but modern scholars recognize the constricted space and patternized brushwork as signs of a seventeenth-century copy"

Jar_with_Scrolling_Vine_and_Gourds,"Jars in this shape, which were used to hold slops, are often called leys jars, after the Dutch term for such vessels. This shape is often found in Chinese ceramics after the early sixteenth century; however, the quality of the porcelain used here suggests that it may have been made slightly earlier."
Landscape_No._398,"Landscape No. 398 is a meditation on the dry brush mode of the monk-painter Hongren (1610–1664). Wang painted with the brush at a slanted angle but valued brushwork that he described as “round,” or “center-tipped,” meaning that the brush never turned over to create sharp creases or angles. Though Wang’s brush moves in angular formations in this work, close examination reveals that he always kept the tip of the brush centered to avoid what he called “ribbon-like” lines, a violation of the brushwork standards that he considered canonical within the tradition of scholarly landscape painting. 398 is a study in the challenges and contradictions of such brushwork, the interplay of angular form with rounded brushwork. Wang’s brush darts this way and that, following an internal sense of form based on years of study of ancient masterpieces. Though the work he arrives at is largely abstract, its connection to premodern landscape is palpable in its brushwork and sense of composition. The addition of a few buildings, sailboats, and human figures added by Wang’s friend Cheng Shifa (1921–2007), transform the work from an exercise in abstraction into a landscape painting (Fig. 2)."
The_Moon_Goddess_Chang_E,"A supremely gifted scholar and painter, Tang Yin forfeited all chances of an official career after being involved in an examination scandal in the capital in 1499. Turning to painting and writing poetry for a living, he led the life of a dissolute scholar and died in poverty. The brilliantly executed Moon Goddess, Chang E is a poignant reminder of Tang Yin's dashed dreams for success in the official examinations, symbolized by the cassia branch in the goddess's left hand. (The word for ""cassia"" [gui] is a pun on the word for ""nobility"" [also pronounced gui].) Tang Yin's poem, in bold calligraphy, reads:She was long ago a resident of the Moon Palace,Where phoenixes and cranes gathered and embroideredbanners fluttered in heavenly fragrance.Chang E, in love with the gifted scholar,Breaks off [for him] the topmost branch of the cassia tree.A frequent visitor to Suzhou's notorious pleasure quarter, Tang Yin may have painted this glamorous figure, a portrait perhaps, for a favorite companion, whom he regarded as a goddess condemned to mortal suffering. A rectangular seal next to his signature proudly proclaims the artist's moment of worldly success, which occurred in 1498: ""Placed First [in the] Nanjing [Provincial Examination]."""
Incense_burner_in_the_shape_of_a_goose,"The careful sculpting and meticulous anatomical details of the current work demonstrate the new taste and high standards of the early Ming imperial court. Cleverly designed so that the fragrant incense is exhaled from the bird’s open beak, the censer artfully combines naturalism, ornamental detail, and an appreciation of history through its reference to bird-shaped incense burners (first created during the Han dynasty [206 BCE–220 CE] and revived during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries)."
Vase_with_Dragonfish_Handles,"Vases of this type were especially popular in Japan, where they were sometimes used in the tea ceremony. The vase’s form, known as a mallet shape, can be traced to glass vessels produced in Syria in the ninth and tenth century and was most likely introduced to China at around that time. The fanciful handles are a Chinese addition."
Bowl_with_auspicious_symbols,"This bowl combines Buddhist and Daoist symbols in an unusual composition. Set among lotus scrolls, auspicious symbols include not only the Eight Buddhist Treasures but also miscellaneous emblems, such as three peaks, swastikas (symbolizing eternity), ingots, and rhinoceros horns. The roundel on the center of the interior base is a stylized symbol of taiji (or yin-yang), a primary force of the universe in Chinese philosophy."
Bowl_with_peony,"Chinese potters in the north started to experiment with polychrome overglaze decoration during the late twelfth century. While objects with brownish-black ornaments were more commonly found in this period, multicolored wares began to make up a small part of the region’s ceramic production. These objects feature bold and expressive motifs, often in green and red, such as the peony on this bowl."
Dish_with_peonies_and_dragonfly,The creation in the late seventeenth century of a range of opaque overglaze enamel colors was one of the most important technological developments in the Chinese porcelain industry. The delicate pink enamel of the blossoms on this dish first appeared in the early eighteenth century during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1723–35) and continued to be used during that of the Qianlong Emperor.
Faceted_vase_with_flowers,"Inspired by Islamic color aesthetics, Chinese blue-and-white porcelains made in the fourteenth century also unmistakably evoke the form of bronze vases. In contrast to the fluid profile and subtle monochrome glaze of Song ceramics, this vase features an octagonal cross section that is modeled after polygonal bronze vases. Potters divided the surface into registers and painted them with various images, such as triangular leaflike motifs, vines and flowers, and stylized lotus petals."
Cup_with_two_feline_dragons,"Found in all media, feline dragons with short snouts, horns, and long snakelike bodies first appeared in Chinese art during the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 B.C.). They reappeared during the twelfth to the fifteenth century and became prominent again during the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), an era characterized by a pervasive interest in the past."
"""Double_phoenix""_lobed_box_and_cover","The carving on this elaborate box depicts a pair of phoenixes among stylized clouds, exemplifying the highest standard of craftsmanship from the mid-eighteenth century—a golden age of Chinese lapidary work. Its pattern and form represent an archaistic reinterpretation of gold and silver designs of the Tang dynasty (618–907). Additionally, the “double phoenix” design was a popular motif on imperial Qing artworks in porcelain, jade, glass, metalwork, and other media.."
Set_of_wine_cups_with_flowers_of_the_twelve_months,"Known as ""monthly flower cups,"" this type of cup set is highly appreciated as one of the finest imperial Qing porcelains. The flowers of the twelve lunar months are winter jasmine, apricot, peach, tree peony, pomegranate, lotus, orchid, sweet Osmanthus, chrysanthemum, Chinese rose, plum, and narcissus. The poems on the backs of the objects, mainly derived from famous Tang-dynasty (618–907) poems, appraise the values associated with these flowers."
Plate,"Chinese export porcelain was one of the luxuries deemed essential to a well-appointed eighteenth-century house. Until 1784, when direct trade began between China and America, Chinese porcelain came to the colonies by way of Europe. The overglaze floral decoration on this service, made for Samuel and Judith (née Commelin) Verplanck of New York, is entirely European. Were it not for its unbroken family history, the close relationship of the design to that on Meissen porcelain would suggest that it had been made for the German or Scandinavian market. The service was presumably ordered for the Verplancks’ house at 3 Wall Street, where they lived from 1763 until 1803."

Tray_with_women_and_boys_on_a_garden_terrace,"Scenes of harmonious families featuring women and frolicking children—expressions of the hope for and joy of having offspring—began to appear in Chinese decorative art in the late Song dynasty (960–1279). This massive platter’s relief carving is typical of high Yuan-dynasty style. Three different geometric patterns—respectively delineating sky, water, and land—are testament to the artist’s sophisticated skill. The artist had a sense of humor, too—a boy plays hide-and-seek behind the large garden rock, but shows only his forehead."

Dish_with_peafowls_and_peonies,"The “two birds” design featuring a pair of birds among flowers was a popular motif in Chinese carved lacquer, particularly from the thirteenth to early fifteenth century. On this dish, artisans carved into the surface to reveal two peafowls flying amid lush, blossoming peonies. This design also became standard in other media, such as textiles and ceramics, produced by the imperial workshop of the early Ming dynasty."

Bowl_imitating_realgar,"The mineral realgar, also known as ruby sulphur because of its red and yellow coloration, has long been understood as an antidote to various venoms and as a substance able to repel evil. It was used in Chinese traditional medicine and added to wine, possibly as a flavoring or to increase its medicinal properties."
Bowl_with_imaginary_composite_flowers,"The blossoms and leaves on this bowl illustrate an imaginary flower that combines elements of the peony, lotus, chrysanthemum, pomegranate, and other plants. Intended to represent majesty and beauty, this decorative flower (often known as a baoxianghua) first appeared in the sixth or seventh century. Flowers are not found as motifs in Chinese art prior to this period, and it is possible they were introduced with Buddhist imagery."
Vase_with_dragon,"Flowers and birds are commonly found on famille noire ware, but this vase features two powerful dragons chasing fire pearls among clouds in a design showcasing a strong color contrast of green and black enamel. The whimsical expressions of these dragons reveal the potter’s sense of humor, which is unusual in Chinese ceramics."
Tripod_censer,"The intense marbleized orange color of this incense burner successfully imitates realgar, an arsenic sulfide mineral used in Chinese traditional medicine. This mineral has long been understood as an antidote to various venoms and as a substance with the ability to ward off evil. By evoking realgar, this vessel would have been thought to be imbued with additional power, making it a highly appreciated item on a scholar’s desk."
Vase_with_lions,"The doglike lions cavorting on the surface of this vase are often known as Fu dogs in the West. Fu, or fo, is the Chinese word for Buddha, and the creatures were probably so named because they are often found in temples or monastic compounds. Here they are placed among various emblems of good luck and fortune, such as flaming pearls, coral branches, and silver ingots."
Chicken-Headed_Ewer,"The beginnings of the Chinese celadon tradition can be traced to the Yue kilns (a term that comes from the ancient name for a region in Zhejiang Province), which in the fourth century began to produce highfired stoneware covered with gray-green glazes. Early examples such as this were produced as burial goods. The meaning of the chicken head on the spout remains obscure."
Bowl_with_bird,"Made in large quantities in Hunan Province in southwest China, small bowls such as this were widely traded, particularly to centers in West Asia. More than 50,000 similar pieces were recently excavated from a shipwreck near Belitung in Indonesia, attesting to the scale of early trade in Chinese ceramics."
Funerary_jar,"The fanciful shape of this jar, with its six tubular spouts, is intriguing and remains difficult to explain. Urns of this shape, which were employed to store rice and other grains used in burial ceremonies, are among the earliest types of ceramics produced in the Longquan kilns located in Zhejiang Province not far from those producing Yue wares The latter are often credited as the first celadon in Chinese history."
Snuff_bottle_with_scene_of_a_lotus_pond,Snuff bottles were among the first glass items produced at the Qing imperial workshops and remained popular throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The technique used to achieve the ruby color of the outer layer of glass on this piece can be traced back to ancient Rome and was transmitted to Chinese artisans working in Guangzhou and Beijing in the early eighteenth century. The same recipe was used to color pink enamels of the period.
Stem_Cup_with_Chrysanthemum_Scroll,"Briefly produced in the fourteenth century, small white porcelains such as this are often cited as an intermediary step between the Qingbai celadons and the fabled blue-and-white wares of Jingdezhen. Ceramics of this type are often catalogued as Shufu ware because the two Chinese characters shu and fu are found in the interiors. These translate as “privy council” and indicate that such ceramics were intended for official use."
Panel_with_the_five_poisonous_creatures,"Woven using one of the oldest and most developed techniques of Chinese textiles, this gauze features subtle patterns in a monochrome palette. The design presents five poisonous creatures: the centipede, lizard, scorpion, snake, and toad. Their protective qualities are called upon during the Duanwu Festival, or the Dragon Boat Festival, which occurs on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. People wear clothes and use objects depicting these creatures during the festival to ward off harm."
Incense_burner_in_the_shape_of_a_rooster,"A symbol of diligence and fortune, the rooster is a particularly popular Chinese decorative motif. This incense burner has an ingenious design: the hollow body houses the burning incense and the detachable wings serve as the lid, with several small openings on the wings allowing the fragrant smoke to escape."
Brush_Pot_with_King_Wen_and_the_Scholar_Jiang_Taigong,"The widespread literacy that marked the late sixteenth century and the concurrent flowering of woodblock-printed books had a significant impact on Chinese porcelain produced between the late sixteenth and the mid-seventeenth century, helping to spread historical tales such as that of the visit of an ancient king to a famous scholar."
Finial_for_a_Buddhist_staff_(khatvanga),"Tibetan Buddhism was practiced at the Chinese court throughout the fifteenth century. This finial would have capped a long staff used in Buddhist rituals to quell demons, which are symbolic of obstacles that must be overcome to reach enlightenment. Depicted on this implement are an overflowing vase (an Indic symbol of abundance) and three heads (one human, one decaying, and one skeletal), which represent the inevitability of change and death."
Elephant_carrying_a_vase,"This sculpture is typical of an innovative style of the eighteenth to early nineteenth century, when Chinese craftspeople created novel designs by combining traditional forms with decorative elements from other cultures. While the compact and broad shapes of the animals are derived from the native tradition, the sparkling inlays of semiprecious stones are unmistakably inspired by the jades of Mughal India."
Plate_with_Dragon_and_Waves,"The chaos that marked the transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasty in the mid-seventeenth century spurred European demand for Japanese porcelains, which began to be exported in significant numbers. As production resumed in China, Chinese potters sometimes re-created the Japanese styles—characterized by the dense pattering on the rim—that the European markets desired."
Vase_with_peony_and_magnolia,"The delicate pink in this painting illustrates the development of new colors in the eighteenth century. Opaque white derived from a lead arsenite and pale pink tinted with bits of gold were added to the palette and combined with existing colors to create a range of hues on the flowers. In traditional Chinese art, peony and magnolia is a classic combination symbolizing grace and fortune."
Incense_burner,"This massive tripod incense burner is a rare example of Chinese rootwood carving. Known as “natural wood” (tianran mu), such objects sought to evoke a rustic lifestyle by accentuating the irregularities inherent in rootwood over the regular surfaces of most human-made objects. Replicating the shape of a bronze tripod, it was further imbued with the archaistic taste so highly appreciated among the literati, reflecting both objects of antiquity and nature."
Horse_carrying_books,"This sculpture is typical of an innovative style of the eighteenth to early nineteenth century, when Chinese craftspeople created novel designs by combining traditional forms with decorative elements from other cultures. While the compact and broad shapes of the animals are derived from the native tradition, the sparkling inlays of semiprecious stones are unmistakably inspired by the jades of Mughal India."
Inkstand_in_the_shape_of_a_butterfly,"This enamel work demonstrates a joyful fusion of Chinese design and Western function. Inkstands were commonly used in the West when quills and dip pens were popular writing accessories. The butterfly has four compartments under its wings: two small inkwells with lids, a sand shaker for drying ink, and a candlestick—probably to melt wafers for sealing letters. The humorous face of the butterfly adds an extra layer of charm to the colorful design."
Seal_with_knob_in_the_shape_of_a_wheel,"Symbolic of teaching, the wheel is a standard motif in Buddhist art. The Chinese inscription on the top of this seal gives the date and indicates that it was commissioned for a Tibetan monk, whose name can be transliterated as Yeshi Zangbu. The seal on the bottom reads ji xiu qiu lü, or “study the law [Buddhism] with diligence.”"
Standing_attendant,"This standing attendant is likely a rare representation of a non-Han Chinese figure from the north, as suggested by his plump face with narrowed eyes, his long hair in double braids, and his costume of a tunic with wide lapels, loose trousers, and pointed boots. His belt, from which a triangular pouch, a knife, and a circular box are suspended, also reflects the nomadic way of life."
Ewer_with_dancing_figures,"The curly hair of the dancer appliqued to the ewer suggests that this figure is not of Chinese ethnicity. He may represent a South or Southeast Asian individual, or even someone from Central Asia. Similar dancing figures, depicted on ceramics from north China, often represent Sogdians, a trading people based in present-day Uzbekistan, known for their whirling dances."
Jar_with_carp_in_lotus_pond,"Perfecting the enameling techniques developed earlier in the Ming dynasty, porcelain enamelers of the Jiajing period created rich reds, yellows, and greens, superimposed onto underglaze blue. Contemporaneous sources attest to the firing of two hundred jars with similar pond scenes during the twenty-first year of the Jiajing reign (1542). Eroded areas of similar jars in other museums show that the deep red hues were created by overlaying a red enamel on a yellow base, a technique that lends the design an immediate visual impact."
Vase,"Vases in this shape have long been known as “prunus vases” or meiping, a Chinese term that is also a homonym for beautiful vessel. Despite their name, it seems likely that such vessels were used as bottles for wine or other beverages, as well as to display plum blossoms and other flowers."
Jar,"In the eighth and ninth centuries, technically advanced Xing wares were the rarest and most valued ceramics in Asia. Some are known to have been used at the Chinese court. Others were either diplomatic gifts or trade goods sent to centers such as the Abbasid court in Iraq, where they inspired poetry comparing them to the luster of a pearl or of the moon."
Tripod_incense_burner_with_archaistic_patterns,"This censer demonstrates the continued importance of antiquarianism among patrons of Yaozhou stoneware during the twelfth century, when most of north China was under the rule of the Jurchen Jin dynasty. The form, the decor, and even the pale green glaze recall ancient bronze tripod cauldrons. This finely molded ceramic, however, has been given a new function as an incense burner."
Figure_of_a_charioteer,"This figure is among the earliest Chinese representations of nomadic peoples on the northern frontier. Its identity is indicated by the short sword and belted jacket, a costume designed for an equestrian culture. The figure may have belonged to a larger assemblage. Judging from his posture and the position of his arms, it could have been a foot on the corner of a vessel or a lamp stand."
Vase_in_Form_of_Archaic_Bronze,"Cataloguing of porcelains with a yellow background remains problematic. Although vases such as this have traditionally been dated to the eighteenth century, it is possible that they were produced in the nineteenth as part of the reinvigoration of trade in Chinese porcelains spurred by the new interest in this material on the part of collectors such as Benjamin Altman."
Dish_in_Shape_of_Mount_Fuji_with_Horses_and_Deer,"The shape of the dish, which alludes to the famed Mount Fuji, indicates that it was commissioned by a Japanese patron, most likely for a meal that accompanied the tea ceremony. The inscription, which discusses roaming with deer and horses in a landscape, is an allusion to a similar phrase in the writings of the Chinese philosopher Mencius (ca. 327–289 B.C.)."
Herdboy_with_water_buffalo,"Animal and human figures have been a popular trend in Chinese cloisonné production since the mid-eighteenth century. These lively depictions gave new dimension to this traditional art form and added a playful touch to upscale interior spaces. Here, the brown and white enamels successfully mimic a water buffalo’s skin, together with the gilded cloisons representing its hair. Gazing back, the buffalo seems to be enjoying the boy’s flute playing."
Jar_with_Winged_Animals_over_Waves,"The theme of winged animals, in this case a horse, an elephant, a mongoose, a fish, a rabbit, and two cervids, was most likely inspired by the extraordinary court-sponsored maritime expeditions of the early fifteenth century, in which a Chinese fleet, under the direction of Zheng He (1371–1433), reached the coast of Africa."
Pillow_with_a_falcon_attacking_a_swan,"The spring hunt and a related autumnal event were integral to the yearly cycle of the Jurchen, a nomadic people from the northeast who controlled much of northern China as the Jin dynasty. The motif of a tiny hawk capturing a much larger swan (or goose) was found in jade, textiles, and ceramics produced during their rule."
Monk’s_cap_ewer,"The form of this ewer comes from Tibetan metalwork; because the top reminded Chinese patrons of the hats worn by Tibetan monks, it was given the name “monk’s cap ewer” (sengmaohu). It is a tea container intended for use in Tibetan Buddhist rituals. Probably a gift for a prominent Tibetan cleric, this example is made of the exceptionally pure white porcelain of the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. Finely incised floral scrolls fill the upper register while auspicious Tibetan phrases wrap around the vessel’s waist."
Vase_with_lotus_scrolls,"Judging from the pattern style and translucent enamels, especially the dark purple, the central part of this vase was a jar from the second half of the fifteenth century. But the enamel over its trumpet-shaped neck and foot ring has a dull and grayish tone, likely from the late sixteenth century. It is not unusual to see such combination of parts from different periods when cloisonné came to be favored in the antique market. These “fusion” works, like this vase, were often embellished with an apocryphal mark of Jingtai (1450–57), a legendary golden period of Chinese cloisonné."
Drill_for_carving_jade,"These steel drills with blunt points (zhuangding or dingzi in Chinese), flat heads (tuozi), or curving heads (wazi) are used for high relief carving, undercutting, and fine shaping of small jade works. The craftsman holds the jade in one hand against the drill, which is mounted on a spinning shaft. He or she rotates the shaft using foot treadles, while continuously applying abrasives, usually sand mixed with water, to the tip of the drill, which cuts the jade."

Page_from_Ten_Bamboo_Studio_Manual_of_Painting,"First published in 1633, the manual of Ten Bamboo Studio (Shizhuzhai) is one of the earliest and finest examples of color printing from China. The book, which served as both luxury object and guide for aspiring painters, compiles familiar images from Chinese art, especially flowers, birds, fruits, and rocks. Various decorative objects, including archaistic bronzes, also appear in the manual and reflect the contemporary taste of the later Ming period. These pages are from an eighteenth-century reprint edition."
Sutra_Covers_with_the_Eight_Buddhist_Treasures,"This pair of red lacquered wood covers once protected a copy of the Sutra of the Great Aeon. On each, the central triple flaming jewel, symbolizing the three jewels of Buddhism, is flanked by four of the Eight Buddhist Treasures, which include the wheel, parasol, knot, paired fish, canopy, lotus, jar, and conch shell. In 1401, Emperor Yongle ordered the printing of the Tibetan Buddhist canon (Kangyur). Unlike the scroll or accordion-fold book format of Chinese texts, Tibetan texts were organized as stacks of loose-leaf sheets that would have fit between these covers."

Vase_with_Flowering_Plum,"A harbinger of spring, the flowering plum is a traditional motif in Chinese art. The lively branch here was created by covering the surface of the vase with wax or some other resist before covering it with a glaze. This technique is typical of the art of the Jizhou kilns, located in the southeast in Jiangxi Province and noted for their experimentation with surface decoration as well as for their tea bowls. Unlike many other ceramic types, Jizhou wares were not exported to other countries."
"Blind_with_scrollwork,_bat,_and_flowers","Multicolored silk threads wrapped around bamboo form an image of a red bat holding a jeweled disc. Enclosed by blue scrollwork, the bat is set against the background of a floral scroll in delicate shades of green, cream, and yellow. Since the Chinese word for “bat” is a homophone for “good fortune,” the animal is generally regarded as an auspicious symbol."
Seated_luohan_with_a_servant,"This luxurious carving was made for the Qing imperial court. The luohan, a Buddhist sage, sits in meditation with a rosary while a boy attends at his feet. From his long eyebrows and position beneath a tree, this luohan may be identified as Nakula. A poem of praise for Nakula in the upper right was authored by the Jiaqing emperor (r. 1796–1820) and inscribed by his elder brother Yongxing (1752–1823)."
Vase_with_Poet_Zhou_Dunyi,"The larger seated figure resting near the banks of a lotus pond is the scholar-official Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073), who wrote an elegant poem about his love for this flower. Representations of poets appear in Chinese ceramics in the fourteenth century and are often identified by references to their writings. A long inscription written on the bottom of this jar dates it to 1587, and indicates that it was commissioned for the use of an auxiliary palace in the southwest."

Vase_with_Nine_Peaches,"The delicate pink in the painting illustrates the development of new colors in the early part of the eighteenth century. Opaque white derived from a lead arsenite, and pale pink tinted with bits of gold were added to the palette and combined with existing colors to create a range of hues."
One_of_a_pair_of_parakeets,"During the Qianlong period, artisans working with cloisonné enamels expanded their repertoire to create three-dimensional representations of birds and other animals, depictions that have a long history in Chinese bronze casting. These parakeets could have been loosely modeled on prints of bronze antiquities, or inspired by the famous five-colored parakeet painted by Song-dynasty emperor Huizong (r. 1100–1126) as an auspicious omen. The polychrome possibilities of cloisonné enamels lent themselves particularly well to this colorful subject."

Plate_with_Yu_Boya_and_Zhong_Ziqi_enjoying_zither_music,"This plate exemplifies a transitional stage in polychromatic Chinese porcelain. Blue is still painted with underglaze cobalt, while all the other colors are achieved with overglaze enamel. The plate illustrates a story about a deep bond between music connoisseurs from ancient China. Yu Boya—a legendary qin zither musician active in the sixth century BCE—is moved by insightful comments on his playing by the humble woodcutter Zhong Ziqi, who likened the music to a lofty mountain and a running river."
Four-lobed_box_(from_incense_set),"Introduced from Europe, the technique of painted enamel was also commonly used by Chinese makers to decorate local wares, such as this incense set. Three-piece sets like this one appeared in China no later than the thirteenth century and included censers to burn small pieces of incense over burning charcoal. The box would have contained incense woods or balls, and the bottle would have held a pair of chopsticks and a spatula for handling the incense materials. (Set includes (81.1.638a–c, .642, .637a, b)"

The_Arhat__Vajraputra,"Tibetan Buddhism, imported in China by Mongol rulers in the thirteenth century, enjoyed further patronage from fifteenth-century emperors of the early Ming period. This work vividly demonstrates how hieratic Tibetan imagery was transformed under Chinese influence into a more naturalistic style, witnessed most strongly in the Sinicized treatment of landscapes. This painting, originally part of a set depicting the sixteen arhats (Buddhist saints), portrays Vajraputra, his hand raised in the teaching gesture (vitarkamudra), expounding dharma to a devotee. Tibetan inscriptions appear on the lower left margin and on the reverse."
Covered_vessel_in_the_shape_of_a_heavenly_rooster,"Containers in the shape of a rooster carrying a vessel on its back are an invention of Song dynasty (960–1279) antiquarians, who believed that such ritual vessels existed in the classical age of ancient China. This rock crystal vessel was modeled after the bronze ones that were catalogued as “heavenly rooster vases” (tianjizun) in the collection of Emperor Qianlong (r. 1736–95), who had a deep interest in the antiquities. The term “heavenly rooster” comes from a Chinese legend about a mythical bird whose crowing awakens the whole world."

Buddha_with_radiate_halo_and_mandorla,"This portable shrine from the northern branch of the Central Asian Silk Road was probably the centerpiece of a three-part traveling shrine—a small triptych with doors. Two donors on the base venerate what appears to be a pot overflowing with vegetation. Such shrines for personal devotion traveled with merchants and pilgrims. While the Buddha, especially his hairstyle, can be related to Chinese imagery, the overall presentation of the figure and the combined halo and mandorla show connections to the Afghan and Gandharan visual tradition (see 48.66a, b)."
Tray,"Chinese export porcelain was one of the luxuries deemed essential to a well-appointed eighteenth-century house. Until 1784, when direct trade began between China and America, Chinese porcelain came to the colonies by way of Europe. The overglaze floral decoration on this service, made for Samuel and Judith (née Commelin) Verplanck of New York, is entirely European. Were it not for its unbroken family history, the close relationship of the design to that on Meissen porcelain would suggest that it had been made for the German or Scandinavian market. The service was presumably ordered for the Verplancks’ house at 3 Wall Street, where they lived from 1763 until 1803."
Wine_container_in_the_shape_of_a_leather_pouch,Increased contact with the nomadic peoples living along the Zhou dynasty’s northern borders brought about new vessel types inspired by leather flasks.
Decorative_pendant_with_the_Five_Offerings,"Silk textiles played an important role in the early Ming dynasty, both as the focus of religious practices and as formal gifts to Tibetan Buddhist clerics and other visitors to the Chinese court. This pendant depicts the five auspicious offerings in Buddhism, each symbolizing a sense or perception: the pile of fragrant incense (smell), the flower (color), the candle (light), the conch (sound), and the offering of food (taste). Meticulously embroidered with silk threads, the stylized lotus scrolls demonstrate the standard court design universally used on imperial works of art, including cloisonné enamel wares."

Qur'an_Juz_II,"The earliest surviving Chinese Qur'ans date to the fifteenth century and were associated with Chinese Sunni Muslim communities called the Hui. The Qur'ans were divided into juz' (one of thirty parts into which the Qur'an is divided) and followed a standard format that endured throughout the Ming Period (1368–674) and later.This juz' is written in Sini script, a variation of muhaqqaq (one of the six canonical proportional scripts). Several of its folios are illuminated with decorative patterns characteristic of Sini Qur'ans. These are typically executed in gold and outlined in black, green, and red ink. The patterns and motifs found in these Qur'ans include overlapping circles, eye-shaped and lobed cartouches, four-petalled floral diesigns and star-shaped geometric forms, and plaited framing devices. This juz' features ornate swirling vegetal designs in the outside borders and is bound in richly decorated stamped brown leather binding featuring Sini calligrams in teardrop-shaped medallions, sinified cartouches, and medallions."

Dish_in_the_shape_of_a_leaf,Flowers and birds increasingly became the dominant motifs of Tang silver from the eighth century onward.
Ewer_in_the_shape_of_a_peach,"This type of pot was most likely used to serve wine. Its peach-like shape is an allusion to longevity and immortality, presumably virtues that seem more attainable when drinking wine for a birthday celebration."
Vase_with_decoration_of_dragons_among_clouds_(one_of_a_pair),"The technique of incising a very delicate pattern into the surface of a porcelain vessel before covering it with a thick glaze, which obscures the underlying decoration, became popular in the early fifteenth century and was used thereafter. The long, elegant necks and bulbous bodies of these miniature vases most likely derive from an Islamic glass prototype introduced to China centuries earlier."
Bowl_with_decorative_medallions,"Some of the brightly colored medallions on this bowl derive from flowers, others from balls found under the feet of lions in Buddhist art. The latter may have developed from the wishing jewel (Sanskrit: cintamani), which was introduced to China with Buddhist iconography, and later became a flaming pearl associated with dragons and widely used as an auspicious motif."
Boy_with_leaves_and_box,"Two boys each holding a lotus or a leaf in one hand and a box in the other are popular images symbolic of harmony and union. Known as the Two Immortals of Harmony (He-He Erxian)—in reference to the characters for these virtues, both of which are read he—this pair is also thought to have been inspired by the legendary Tang dynasty (618–907) Buddhist monks Hanshan and Shide.

Dish_with_grapes_and_squirrels,The combination of squirrels and grapes is a rebus wishing the owner or viewer a long life.
"Buddhist_disciple,_or_luohan,_holding_a_peach","Although they are referenced in Indian sources, luohans (Sanskrit: arhat), or Buddhist disciples, are not represented in the visual arts of the subcontinent. Based on the disciples of the Historical Buddha, this group of sixteen figures was first depicted in China in the tenth century. By the sixteenth century, luohans had become an important motif in secular painting and the decorative arts, where they are understood as exemplars of a cultivated, but renunciatory, lifestyle."
Vase,"This vase is one of four, each with a subtly different shape, included in a set of eight accoutrements designed for display on a writing table. Such sets are thought to have been made as gifts for officials working at court."
Cup_with_Eight_Daoist_Immortals,"By the early thirteenth century a historical group of eight figures—seven male, and one female—had become symbolic of the attainment of immortality, one of the primary goals of Daoism. Each figure is a patron of a specific group and is identifiable by the object that he (or she) holds. For example, Lan Caihe, patron of gardeners and florists, carries a basket and Han Xiangzi, patron of musicians, has a flute."

Vase_in_the_shape_of_a_flower,"Although known in China as early as the late sixth century, porcelain was first used extensively in the kilns at Jindgezhen during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries to make delicate Qingbai wares for both domestic use and export. After the mid-fourteenth century, production at these kilns focused on porcelain with cobalt blue painted under the glaze, and Qingbai was no longer made."
Brush_washer_with_lotus,"This is a rare example of a work produced at the prolific Longquan kilns for domestic, specifically scholarly, use. Exported for over five hundred years, Longquan wares have been found in Japan, Southeast Asia, the Islamic world, and Europe."
Bowl_in_the_shape_of_a_lotus_leaf,"This bowl is shaped like a lotus and embellished with carved decoration that provides a continuous scene of lotus blossoms, pods, and leaves. The image of lotuses with stems entwined together is a rebus for firm roots and luxuriant branches (bengu zhirong)—an allusion to good wishes for a flourishing business"
Snuff_bottle_with_gourd_on_a_trellis,"The ingenious use of different colors or flaws in the stone is a technique known as ""smart colors,"" which can produce unexpected spectacles in the hands of experienced carving masters. Here the artist creates the image of a gourd hanging from a trellis by simply polishing the surface of the stone and leaving the dark spot and veins untouched."
Miniature_vase_in_the_shape_of_an_ancient_ritual_vessel_(gu),"The shape, raised ridges, and incised decoration on the surface of this vase derive from bronze beakers produced during the Shang dynasty (ca.1600–1046 B.C.)."
Ink_cake_with_cyclical_imagery,"Chinese ink is made by mixing animal glue with carbon collected from burning resinous wood or vegetable oil. It is molded into various shapes, including rectangular tablets and round cakes, then ground on an inkstone with water to produce liquid ink. Some ink cakes are further embellished with molded designs. This disk has been decorated with the twelve zodiac animals and a Western-style clock face on one side and a poem in elegant calligraphy on the other."
Trumpet-mouth_carving_tool,"These steel drills with blunt points (zhuangding or dingzi in Chinese), flat heads (tuozi), or curving heads (wazi) are used for high relief carving, undercutting, and fine shaping of small jade works. The craftsman holds the jade in one hand against the drill, which is mounted on a spinning shaft. He or she rotates the shaft using foot treadles, while continuously applying abrasives, usually sand mixed with water, to the tip of the drill, which cuts the jade."
Bodhisattva_Avalokiteshvara_(Guanyin),"A removable panel in the back of this image gives access to a hollow interior that would have been filled with offerings at the time of the piece’s consecration. The interior surface of the panel bears a date (1282) and a small bronze mirror (34.15.2) that functioned as a protective talisman.The bodhisattva has a rounded physique and stands in a slightly twisting pose, which creates a sense of depth. Both conventions attest to the introduction of Indo-Himalayan sculptural traditions in China in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, when the Mongols controlled both China and parts of Tibet. The elaborate coiffure also derives from these traditions."
Cup_in_the_shape_of_a_magnolia_blossom,"Once grown exclusively for the imperial family, magnolias are sometimes understood as allusions to beautiful women."
Recumbent_deer,"This small but beguiling sculpture captures an intimate moment as a recumbent deer scratches its muzzle with its left hind leg. This deer is a rare example of realistic sculpture from the Yixing kilns, which are famous for their tea wares but also produced small sculptures of animals, plants, nuts, and fruits from the eighteenth century onward"
Brush_washer_in_the_shape_of_a_peach,"This charming brush washer has been lovingly crafted in the form of a peach. It is made from opaque white glass with daubs of red and pink to simulate the skin of a fully ripe fruit. A green branch with pointed leaves extends from its bottom and winds around one side. A small blue bat with curving wings is perched near the mouth of the vessel. Most appealing of all is a clear, bright red drop of glass that highlights the pointed tip of the fruit. The bottom of the vessel bears a four-character inscription is incised into the surface and filled with gold: “Made in the Qianlong reign era.” The inscription makes it likely that this piece was the product of the imperial workshop. Considering the small size and delicate shape, it is more likely a desktop ornament than a practical object."
Covered_box_from_an_incense_set,"This incense set, consisting of an incense burner, a covered box, and a slender vase, is made from flawless white nephrite, the most desirable kind of jade. The relatively small scale of the vessels suggests that they are meant to be desktop ornaments rather than to serve a practical function. They are typical of an innovative style of the eighteenth century, when Chinese craftsmen created novel designs by combining traditional forms with decorative elements from foreign cultures. While the shapes of the vessels are derived from local ritual receptacles, their thin walls and delicately fluted sides are unmistakably inspired by the jades of Mughal India. (Set contains: 02.18.537a, b; .538a, b; .539)"
Wine_pouring_vessel_(Gong),"Every surface of this vessel is animated with fantastic creatures: an owl-like bird with coiled serpent wings dominates the body while another bird forms the handle. Felines, dragons, and fish fill the spaces in between."

(Set contains: 02.18.537a, b; .538a, b; .539)"
Buddha_Dipankara_(Dingguang),"The inscription on the back of this stele identifies the Buddha depicted on the front as Dipankara, who was thought to have lived before the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown here attended by a group of small figures wearing the clothing of the Xianbei, the non–Han Chinese peoples who ruled the Northern Wei dynasty. The smaller standing figure to the Buddha’s right may represent a youth named Sumedha, who was destined to become the historical Buddha in another lifetime. The imagery of this large sculpture is therefore intended to illustrate the promise or possibility of enlightenment in a future life. In Buddhism, the achievement of this advanced spiritual state is the goal of all practitioners.The bodhisattva with crossed ankles on the back of the stele recalls similar figures in the collection from the Yungang cave temple complex."
Pillow_in_the_shape_of_an_infant_boy,"Jadeite was introduced into China from Myanmar, probably in the seventeenth century, and became a favored material at the eighteenth-century Qing court for its intense green color, high translucency, and vitreous luster. This remarkable sculpture of a crouching boy is modeled after the ceramic pillows of the same shape that were produced at the famed kilns of the Song period (960–1279). It not only illustrates the elegant taste of the Qing court but also denotes the increased access to the prized material. The boy, a common motif in Chinese art, expresses the wish for multiple children to carry on the family line."
Vase_from_an_incense_set,"This incense set, consisting of an incense burner, a covered box, and a slender vase, is made from flawless white nephrite, the most desirable kind of jade. The relatively small scale of the vessels suggests that they are meant to be desktop ornaments rather than to serve a practical function. They are typical of an innovative style of the eighteenth century, when Chinese craftsmen created novel designs by combining traditional forms with decorative elements from foreign cultures. While the shapes of the vessels are derived from local ritual receptacles, their thin walls and delicately fluted sides are unmistakably inspired by the jades of Mughal India. (Set contains: 02.18.537a, b; .538a, b; .539)"
Brush_Washer,"Derived from copper, lush pinkish-red glazes were first produced in the third quarter of the seventeenth century as part of experimentation at the Jingdezhen kilns. The delicate red and greenish spots that mottle the surface of this vessel are part of the appeal of this elegant and hard-to-make “peach bloom” glaze."
Set_of_twelve_zodiac_animals,"By the Eastern Han dynasty (9–220 CE), the conventional order of the twelve Chinese zodiac animals was well established. Subsequently, they were paired with ten other calendrical elements, forming a rotating cycle of sixty that was used in China to count the years until the twentieth century. The animals, along with this calendrical system, were also adopted by many other East Asian and Southeast Asian countries.As burial practices grew more elaborate, pottery animals wearing official robes became popular tomb offerings, presumably as symbols of renewal and regeneration. These figures were once colorfully painted, but only the white slip, which usually served as a base for decoration, has survived."
Buddha_Shakyamuni_and_Scenes_of_His_Previous_Lives_(Jataka_Tales),"This painting depicts a rare subject in Tibetan art, the life of Buddha Shakyamuni and his previous incarnations as told in the Jataka tales. These stories form an essential component of the Buddhist cosmology. This thangka has a Chinese inscription dating the work to the reign of the Wanli emperor (r. 1573–1619) of the Ming dynasty as well as Tibetan glosses identifying the scenes depicted. The presence of the glosses indicates that this thangka was made for a Tibetan client. Depicted around the central icon of a radiant Buddha is a series of scenes, each with mountains and monastic buildings serving as scene dividers. Both Jatakas depicted recount the bodhisattva’s self-sacrifice."
Buddha_of_Medicine_Bhaishajyaguru_(Yaoshi_fo),"Iconography:Bhaishajyaguru (A), the Buddha of Medicine, sits on a lotus throne surrounded by an assembly of deities. Standing to either side of the central figure are the Buddha’s attendant bodhisattvas: Candraprabha (B), or Yueguang Pusa 月光菩薩, and Suryaprabha (C), or Riguang Pusa 日光菩薩. They can be identified by the adjacent white moon and the red sun, respectively. Two larger bodhisattvas are seated to the right and left of the smaller standing figures. Two secondary bodhisattvas at lower left and lower right carry a monk’s staff and medicine bowl (D and E), Bhaishajyaguru’s traditional attributes. The Twelve Guardian Generals (F) are depicted at the two sides of the mural. They personify Bhaishajyaguru’s vow to help all in need by curing illness, ensuring the birth of healthy children, and providing clothing and other necessities.This painting was originally paired with an equally large image of Tejaprabha, the Buddha of Blazing Light, who controls the planets and constellations and, therefore, one’s fate. He is believed to bring good fortune and long life. The pairing of Bhaishajyaguru and Tejaprabha is unusual and may illustrate concerns fostered by the devastating earthquake and fire that destroyed the Guangsheng monastery complex in 1303.Technique and Style:This mural was painted on a ground of dry plaster mixed with straw and covered with clay. Thick black outlines define the images, which are filled in using vegetable and mineral pigments. Only the latter—predominantly red, green, and white—have survived. This is one of several murals from the Fen River area, in southern Shanxi province that are associated with the workshop of the early fourteenth-century master craftsman Zhu Haogu. A robust figure type with a full face and shallow spatial constrictions typify the style, found in both Buddhist and Daoist temple art.History:This representation of the Buddha of Medicine once adorned the east wall of the main hall in the Lower Guangsheng (“VastTriumph”) Temple, in the northern Chinese province of Shanxi. Rebuilt after an earthquake in 1303, the temple’s eastern compound is constructed along a north-south axis. The large entry gate leads into the front and main halls, which are connected by coveredwalkways. Used for assemblies and lectures, the main hall once contained paintings on its east, north, and west walls, as well asnumerous freestanding wooden sculptures of Buddhist deities. Records indicate that the hall was rebuilt and refurbished between1303 and 1319.A stele at the temple indicates that in the 1930s the monks sold four of the murals decorating the main hall in order to prevent its collapse after being damaged by an earthquake."
Ritual_object_(cong),"Among Neolithic jades, the cong displays the most complex form: a cylindrical tube encased in a square prism that gently tapers from top to bottom. Simple masks with circular eyes and bar-shaped mouths decorate the corners. Enigmatic in function and meaning, the cong probably signified wealth and social status."
Guardian_Protector_of_the_East_(Dongfang_chiguo_tianwang),"Guardians, particularly the four associated with the cardinal directions, play an important role in Buddhism and are most frequently shown within larger groupings of divinities. Here, the Guardian Protector of the East sits upon a demon symbolic of the obstacles that must be overcome to attain enlightenment, such as egoism and greed. In most Chinese imagery, the Guardian of the East brandishes a sword, but he is shown with a bow and arrow in the southwest province of Yunnan, which from the tenth to the thirteenth century was under the control of the independent Dali kingdom. The inclusion of arsenic in the copper alloy used to cast this sculpture is also typical of Yunnan."
Sitting_boy,"This plump male child is a rare example of secular figural sculpture from the Song dynasty. It was made at a moment when Song sculpture reached a pinnacle of naturalism. Song historical texts and archaeological discoveries indicate that this type of pottery doll (nihai’er), elaborately dressed with real clothes and jewelry, was made for the Qixi Festival (the seventh day of the seventh lunar month) and kept in people’s homes to express the wish for many male children."
Vase,"Made for the Muslim community in China, this vase has two Arabic inscriptions, which read, ""Glory to Allah"" and ""Praise be to Allah."""
Couch,"In warm weather, one would sit on the rattan mat with legs either crossed or pendant. In cold weather, quilts and cushions were added for comfort."
Cup_with_two_dragons_in_waves,The bodies of two dragons are carved on the exterior of this cup and their heads are found inside. It must have been extraordinary to see the dragons partially submerged when wine was poured into the cup and to watch them emerge as the beverage was drunk.
Cup_with_figures_in_a_landscape,The gateway at the base of the cup is most likely part of a private estate or large garden set in a remote but beautiful location. The branches and needles of one of the pine trees carved along the side and in the interior attest to the skill of the anonymous artist who made this object.
Cup_with_grapes,"Sometimes symbolic of autumn, grapes and grapevines also represent abundance, both in the sense of material wealth and multiple children. Often presented as gifts at court, cups made of rhinoceros horn were used for drinking wine in part because the horn was thought to enhance the wine’s fragrance."
Cup_in_the_shape_of_a_magnolia_blossom,"The rhinoceros was once widespread in China, but by the first century A.D. it had become an exotic species whose skin was sought after to make armor and whose horns were carved into drinking cups. During the Tang dynasty (618–907), rhinoceros horns were imported into China along with other foreign goods, such as pearls, sandalwood, and camphor. Elaborate rhinoceros-horn cups for drinking wine and other libations were produced widely from the sixteenth century onward."
Dish_with_mandarin_ducks_and_lotuses,"Thought to mate for life and die if separated, mandarin ducks are symbols of marital fidelity and often decorate wedding gifts. They are frequently depicted together with lotus flowers to symbolize a harmonious conjugal relationship."
Cup_in_the_shape_of_an_archaic_vessel_with_feline_dragons,"The jutting lip of this cup derives from the shape of a ritual bronze vessel created during China’s Bronze Age. Some of the linear interlocked decoration on the middle section of the piece is also loosely based on the decorative imagery of that period, which was widely known through illustrations in antiquarian catalogues and collector’s manuals."
Cup_depicting_Three_Laughers_of_Tiger_Ravine,"Huddled beneath a cliff, a famous poet (Tao Yuanming, 365–427), a Daoist priest (Lu Xiujing, 406–477), and a Buddhist monk (Huiyuan, 334–416) burst into unrestrained laugher as the monk unintentionally breaks a vow by crossing the bridge separating his monastery from the mundane world. This widely depicted scene serves as a parable for the importance of crossing boundaries in the pursuit of understanding."
Wine_container_(Pou),"This large wine container was one of the first significant archaic bronzes to enter the Museum’s holdings. Nearly two feet tall, it remains the largest example in the collection. Created as a bold display of political power, it closely resembles two monumental vessels excavated from the tomb of the royal consort Fu Hao (died ca. 1250 BCE) at Anyang, Henan province."
Arhat_(Luohan),"This life-size sculpture is part of a group of sixteen figures that have been known in the West since 1913. Thought to have come from a cave in Yixian, Hebei province, they represent arhats (or luohans, as they are known in China). Arhats were thought to have achieved an advanced state of spiritual development, and were revered as protectors of Buddhism.Regarded as masterpieces of ceramic sculpture, for their size, naturalistic modeling, and the quality of their three-toned (sancai) glaze, they can be dated securely to the late tenth or eleventh century based on material discovered in 1983 at an ancient kiln site near Beijing."
Stele_commissioned_by_Helian_Ziyue_(赫蓮子悅),"A decisive episode from the Sutra on the Discourse of Vimalakirti is given dramatic and complex treatment on the upper half of this stele. The scene (a debate) takes place in a windblown landscape, as indicated by the trees at center and in the background. Vimalakirti (Weimo) sits in a curtained and tasseled pavilion at right, attended by fourteen figures; Manjushri (Wenshu) is accompanied by thirty attendants. Standing to either side of the two trees at center are the monk Shariputra and a female figure, who together represent the scene's most dramatic moment: Shariputra transforms himself into a woman and then changes back to his original form to demonstrate the impermanence and irrelevance of gender or any other state of being—one of the main points of the sutra. This is also one of the many moments in which the learned Vimalakirti trounces the Bodhisattva of Wisdom.Above the debate scene, a Buddha sits in a columned niche attended by two bodhisattvas; below, two monks kneel to either side of an elaborate incense burner that is supported by a pair of caryatids. The two figures standing between the guardians and the censer-one holding a bird, the other a skull-are standard images in Chinese Buddhist sculpture and represent two Indian ascetics. The long and exceptionally abstruse inscription on the front of the stele indicates that it was commissioned by a devotional society headed by Helian Ziyue (ca. 501–573), who is shown kneeling just right of center in the upper row of figures. He is a rare example of a donor whose name is both mentioned on a work of Buddhist art and identifiable in Chinese historical writings. His family included the chieftain of a tribe originally based in the Ordos region. In the fifth century members of this clan were incorporated into, or possibly married into, the ruling Northern Wei dynasty. After the dissolution of the Northern Wei, Helian Ziyue was placed in charge of a group of subjugated rebels and settled in northern Henan province.The many rubbings taken from the front of the stele have left its surface noticeably darker. It is likely that this side of the stele was recarved at some point in its history, as evidenced by the awkwardly rendered faces of some symbolic portraits and in details such as the lotus pedestal supporting the incense burner at top.Stele (29.72)Base (30.76.302)Figure (1982.200)"

Head_of_a_Bodhisattva,"This head once belonged to an attendant bodhisattva, which had been carved into the back wall of Cave 21 at Tianlongshan, a small complex consisting of twenty-four cave shrines and a wooden temple. Located about twenty-five miles southwest of Taiyuan, in Shanxi province, Tianlongshan opened in the mid-sixth century and was revived in the early eighth century. The history of the site is recorded on a large stone stele, erected in 706 by a General Xun and his wife, who were visiting the site at that time."
The_Spiritual_Master_Padmasambhava,"This portrait of Guru Padmasambhava (Lotus-Born) is one of the earliest known effigies of the eighth-century Indian mystic, revered as the leading propagator of tantric Buddhism in Tibet. He is believed to have gone to Tibet at the invitation of King Trisong Detsen and there founded the Nyingma Order of Tibetan Buddhism. Popularly known as Guru Rinpoche, here he sits enthroned in a yogic posture and holds a thunderbolt scepter (vajra), symbolizing the clarity of pure Buddhist thought, and a skull cup (kapala), representing detachment. He wears the distinctive cloth cap of his order and has distended earlobes, the mark of an enlightened being. His facial expression is accessible, attentive, and spiritually alive. A dedicatory inscription names a royal patron: Kunga Gyalpo, an otherwise unknown ruler from Western Tibet or Ladakh."

Female_musician,"Ensembles featuring female musicians often served as a musical bridge between elite and popular culture. As expert musicians, they were often musical innovators. Here, a small ensemble is shown (23.180.4–.7), clapping and playing the pipa, tongbo (small copper cymbals), and konghou (harp). The pipa is played in its original position, like an Arabic lute; its silk strings are plucked with a triangular plectrum. The construction and playing style resemble those of the biwa, a Japanese lute derived from the pipa. Today, the biwa maintains the use of a triangular plectrum, the West Asian plectrum guard, and the C-shaped sound holes seen on the instrument played by the musician here as well as on the jade belt featured in this case. The Chinese playing style changed during the chaotic Later Tang period (921–36), when the plectrum was discarded. The angular konghou harp, introduced at the end of the Han dynasty, was in decline at this time and had gone completely out of use by the end of the Tang.The highest-rated musicians at the Tang court performed seated, while the lower ranks played standing and were also treated less well in other respects."

Water_dropper_in_the_shape_of_a_rhinoceros,"This adorable water dropper precisely describes a Javanese rhinoceros, with its stout horn and thick hide with prominent folds. The lifelike appearance suggests that the artist might have modeled the piece after a real animal, perhaps one in the imperial menagerie."

Bodhisattva_Manjushri,"This statue portrays Manjushri with four arms, the ultimate manifestation of transcendent wisdom and a well-worshipped bodhisattva in the Ming court. Inscribed on the lotus throne is a reign mark indicating that the statue is as a product of the imperial workshop and was made as a gift bestowed to Tibetan Buddhist monasteries."
White_Tara_and_Green_Tara,"In this unique arrangement of an extremely rare subject, two taras are seated on lotus thrones rising from pools set in a mountainous backdrop. The White Tara, represented with the multiple eyes of omniscience, sits in meditation posture, while the Green Tara hangs one leg pendant. Both lower one hand in the boon-giving varada mudra. The two wives of the first king of Tibet, Songtsen Gampo, were understood to be emanations of Tara; the princess from Nepal is identified with White Tara and the Chinese princess with Green Tara. As King Songtsen Gampo is accepted as a manifestation of Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva and the two taras depicted here are understood to evoke the historical figures credited with establishing Buddhism in Tibet. A Kashmiri influence is detectable in the Guge school, seen here in the sculpted torsos and dress."
Pagoda_base_with_four_Buddhas,"The construction of small, square, pagoda-like shrines appears to have begun in China during the Northern Qi period, and flourished through the Tang dynasty (618–907). Comparisons with other examples suggest that this shrine once stood on a square, possibly stepped, base and was capped by either a domed or tiered roof. Its exterior walls, marked by prominent entryways, enclose a pillar with four Buddhas; although they can no longer be accurately identified, they likely represented the Buddhas most important to Chinese practice during the sixth century. Each wall is capped by a lintel that bears representations of multiple seated Buddhas. Paired dragons fill the upper registers and guardians and lions (many now missing) protect the entryways.The shrine’s interior walls are carved with rows of multiple tiny Buddhas. Exhibiting variations in posture and clothing, they symbolize the immanence of many Buddhas in the cosmos. Numerous shrines of this type can be found in northeast China and are often associated with the remains of notable monks, indicating that they may have functioned as funerary monuments. However, the prominent central pillar in this example suggests that the shrine may have been used for visualization exercises, with a focus on these particular Buddhas."
Hexagonal_flower_vase_with_magic_fungus_handles,"This elegant vase’s elaborate decor, arranged in horizontal registers, follows archaic models but also incorporates contemporary motifs, such as the geometric diaper pattern with swastikas and the turbulent waves. Its two handles are intricately cast in the form of magic fungus, a symbol of longevity; their three-dimensional shape recalls similar images of magic fungus on contemporary jades."
"Vaishravana,_Guardian_of_Buddhism_and_Protector_of_Riches","Vaishravana is a complex Buddhist deity who embodies many strands of thought and belief. Tibetans understand him foremost as the premier of the four guardians of the cardinal directions (lokapalas), associated with the North. In this role he serves as a protector (dharmapala) of Buddhist law. Here we see Vaishravana seated on his snow-lion mount in a stormy atmosphere, accompanied by his generals, the eight Lords of the Horses (asvapati), each riding a storm cloud. Central is Vaishravana himself, dominant is scale and represented emerging from a tumultuous skyscape. He is dressed as a warrior-king in full battle armor with a patterned tunic suggestive of chain-mail armor, mounted with a large lozenge chest-plate with pearl-and-lotus medallion and Chinese-style lion-face protective lappets on the shoulders. Decorated high boots point to his Central Asian ancestral connections. This celebrated Tibetan deity is rarely represented outside of monastery mural programs, such as those seen at Shalu and Gyantse monasteries, in 14th and 15th century respectively. In both pictorial and aesthetic terms, this painting is unrivalled in its sophisticated integration of iconographic complexities into a single coherent visualization of this deity."
Vase_with_dragon_handles,"This vase features an extravagant fusion of various contemporary decorative motifs: bold dragon handles, intricate plant scrolls, and two types of dragons. Notably, the two-dimensional representation of entwined dragons on its foot is also observed in three-dimensional form as a brush rest from the fourteenth century, on view nearby. The high-relief chevrons encircling the belly of the vessel have no clear precedent. The freedom and technical confidence of such bold design is what defines Yuan bronzes."
Ritual_wine_cup_(jue),"The inscription under its lip states that the cup was cast in 1294 for the Confucian school of Wu County (now Suzhou, Jiangsu Province). It was part of a larger project that was completed between 1293 and 1295 and supervised by two scholar-officials, Li Gan and Fang Wenbao. The Cernuschi cup nearby was from the same group but cast one year earlier. The Wu County vessels are the earliest ritual bronzes that bear dated inscriptions from the Yuan dynasty.Inscription至元甲午歲李淦方文豹鑄吳學祭器In the jiawu year of the Zhiyuan reign, Li Gan and Fang Wenbao cast this ritual vessel for the Confucian school of Wu Prefecture."
Vase_with_collage_of_archaistic_motifs,"“Eight-brokens” (bapo)—a kind of collage of fragmentary images of bronzes, steles, bricks, tiles, coins, and other antiques bearing inscriptions—was widely popular from the mid-nineteenth century onward. Playful and laden with epigraphic significance, this unusual design was seen in a range of media, including porcelain, like this current vase."
Brush_washer_with_twin_dragons,This charming bronze was designed as a brush washer for holding water to dampen writing brushes or to dilute the ink tone when writing or painting. A pair of sinuous dragons cast along the rim enlivens this modest vessel.
Pilgrim’s_flask_with_Central_Asian_dancers,"Both the shape and decoration show foreign influence: the shape is based on a West Asian pilgrim’s flask, while the whirling dancer is performing a dance derived from the culture of Sogdia. Centered in present-day Uzbekistan, merchants from this polity, some of whom lived in China, dominated the Silk Road trade from the fourth to the seventh century."
Miniature_mountains_representing_the_mythical_realm_Penglai,"Thought to be somewhere in the Eastern Sea, Penglai is the realm of immortals where jewels grow on trees and rice bowls and wine glasses are never empty."
Box_in_the_shape_of_a_“Buddha’s_hand”_citron,"The citron-shape of this box has been nicknamed Buddha’s hand (foshou) because the fingerlike segments that grow from the stem of a bright yellow citrus fruit are thought to resemble one of the ritual gestures (mudras) found in Buddhist art. Foshou is also a rebus in which the term fo, or Buddha, serves as a homonym for good fortune (fu), while the term for hand (shou) equals longevity (shou)."
Archaic-style_Vase_(hu),Ming dynasty archaistic bronzes not only faithfully followed archaic styles but also explored new artistic and technical directions. This vase is clearly indebted to ancient prototypes; its extensive geometric patterns of gold and silver inlays recall ancient models.
Wine_Vessel_with_Daoist_Immortals,"The eight figures belong to a group codified in the twelfth century due to the flowering of Daoist practices at the time. Often based on quasi-historical figures, they are distinguished from one another by the attributes they hold, including the gourds that influenced the shape of this ewer."
Hair_Ornament,"The prongs of this a hair ornament are missing, but the top is a remarkably fine example of Tang filigree work set off with carved turquoise."
Tripod_incense_burner,"This censer is a creative fusion of archaic and contemporary designs. The tripod form has been modified according to Ming dynasty ideas, notably the elongated handles and pouch-shaped body. The band of stylized dragons around its belly derives from antique models, while the turbulent waves around its neck come from later ceramics. Its inscription states that it was cast in 1486 for the local Confucian temple of Zengcheng (now a suburb of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province).Inscription知增城縣事提調官鍾綱造， 督工訓導白誠， 成化丙午歲置Zhong Gang, mayor of Zengcheng County, commissioned and ordered Instructor Bai Cheng to install [this incense burner] in the bingwu year of the Chenghua reign."
Ritual_water_vessel_(lei),"Inscription松江府提調官同知謝禮顧逖, 判官蔣仁傑, 推官馬玉麒, 知事劉良臣, 提控案牘趙從周、李忠, 府史朱遵, 儒學教授高志道, 學正張鏞,學錄羅孔願, 直學成裕, 司吏茅禮章文質, 至正己亥正月 置Gu Di, Supervisor and Vice Prefect of Songjiang prefecture, Assistant Prefect Jiang Renjie, Judge Ma Yuqi, Chief Clerk Liu Liangchen, Record Keepers Zhao Congzhou and Li Zhong, Office Scribe Zhu Zun, [Confucian school instructors Gao Zhidao . . . ordered on the day of the first month of the jihai year of the Zhizheng reign"
Scepter_(ruyi)_with_gourds_and_vines,"Used as a display item, this scepter takes the shape of a fungus known as a ruyi, a rebus for ""as your wish."""
Rectangular_cauldron_(Fangding)_with_footed_cover_(Zu),"The lid of this vessel, when inverted, functions as a serving table. The same character (clan sign) is cast on the inner wall of the vessel and on the upper surface of the table."
Belt_slide_with_a_falcon_attacking_a_swan,"This carved jade belt slide shows a small falcon hunting a wild goose amid lotus flowers. The motif symbolizes the spring hunt of the Jurchens, a seminomadic people who lived beyond China’s Great Wall in the northeast. Known as chunshui (spring water) in historical texts, the hunt was an important annual Jurchen ritual that Mongol and Manchu royalty continued during the later dynasties. The motif appears widely on ceramics, textiles, and other media."
Woman's_robe_with_peonies_and_shou_medallions,"The peonies scattered over the purple background of this robe indicate that it was to be worn in the spring. Auspicious shou characters woven in gold denote longevity and incorporate the swastika, or wan, which signifies ten thousand years. The robe features sleeve bands, original to the garment, that bear the same pattern on a contrasting white background. Painted details on tapestry are typical of the time period."
Roof_Tile_End,These two roof tiles (with 18.56.30) are decorated with animals that symbolize two of the four cardinal directions: the White Tiger of the West and the Red Bird of the South.
Water_pot_with_dragons_among_clouds,"This water pot was most likely used while writing with a brush and ink. The dragon coiling around the surface was painted in an intentionally murky fashion, creating the impression that the dragon is at a distance or flying through a cloudy sky."
Ritual_grain_container_(fu),"This is the only known example of a Yuan dynasty ritual bronze vessel that can be linked with certainty to a specific place of production. Its inscription states that it was cast in 1321 for the Confucian Temple of Zhongqing Route (now Kunming, Yunnan Province). Based on a historical text, this special order of ritual bronzes was completed with official support in Luling (now Ji’an, Jiangxi Province), a major center of archaistic bronze production.Inscription至治辛酉中慶路文廟禮器 教授趙善坤， 正、錄，孫彬， 杜餘慶記Ritual vessel of the Confucian Temple of Zhongqing Route [made in the year] xinyou of the Zhizhi reign (1321); recorded by instructor Zhao Shankun, second-class instructor Sun Bin, and third-class instructor Du Yuqing."
Octagonal_cup_with_dragon_handles,This cup is extraordinary both for its design and fine casting. Each panel presents a different legendary story conveying auspicious wishes of traditional values.
Brush_rest_in_the_shape_of_a_dragon,"A rare example of 15th century Ming bronze work, this brush rest was cast in the form of a sinuous dragon crouching on its four powerful paws with a “flaming pearl” on its arched back. It is further distinguished by two curved horns and a bifurcated tail that coils and unfurls. Its neck, body, and tail all provide places for resting writing brushes. More than a functional object, this brush rest is an imaginative and auspicious sculpture designed to ornament a scholar’s table."
Tripod_incense_burner,"The inscription encircling this censer’s lower belly indicates that it was from a specific order of a Daoist householder from Xiangxiang (now Hunan Province). The work loosely emulates the form of ancient bronze tripods and their ornamental bands of animal masks. Its underside, in contrast, has a finely cast medallion composed of contemporary patterns, including floral scrolls and lotus petals. Within one of the rings are the eight trigrams, which are widely used in Daoist divination."
Daoist_immortal_Laozi,"Identified by his full beard, Laozi is the quasi-historical author of the seminal Daoist text Dao de jing (The Way and Its Power). In addition to its sumptuous gilding and sensitive presentation, this sculpture is remarkable for its long inscription on the underside of the pendant robe indicating that it was commissioned by an official from a northwestern frontier city for his mother in the Ming capital, Nanjing."
Brush_holder_with_narrative_scene,"The solitary angler may be a reference to an eleventh-century B.C. narrative in which King Wen seeks the advice of a scholar named Jiang Shang. Here, Jiang is about to receive a royal visit."
Long_neck_vase_with_tubular_handles,"This vase’s design foreshadows the revolutionary interpretations of archaic bronzes in the thirteenth century. While the tubular handles and overall shape have roots in ancient bronze ritual wine containers, its elongated neck is inspired by Song ceramics. The four bladelike lappets also derive from ancient bronzes, but they exist as independent motifs that float free of the vessel shape. Covered in a brownish-black patina, the vase evokes the appeal of the remote past."
Folding_Fan_with_Fishing_Net_Decoration,"A similar fan was excavated from the tomb of Zhu Chunchen (died 1601) and his wife (died 1624) in Songjiang District, Shanghai. The fan was found in the wife's left hand."
Incense_burner,"This elegant incense burner embodies both the antiquarian taste and minimalist design of Song arts. Based on larger- scale bronze wine warmers widely used in the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), this smaller version was made by Song artists to accommodate its new function. The elaborate decorative pattern often found on ancient bronzes was also discarded in favor of horizontal bands. This treatment not only adds visual simplicity but also enhances handling pleasure."
Paperweight_in_the_shape_of_a_horse,This horse paperweight is enlivened by its roan coat of dappled gold. The animal’s whimsical expression and the flames emerging from its withers indicate that this is no common steed. The playfulness of such utensils invited their owners to admire and handle them.
Vessel_in_the_shape_of_a_waterfowl_(fuzun),"The bird form of this vessel is almost identical to an ancient one illustrated in the twelfth-century antiquarian catalogue Xuanhe bogutu. Neither the woodblock illustration nor the accompanying text, however, provides any indication that the archaic prototype had any inlay. The vessel’s sumptuous surface decoration would have been favored in the Ming dynasty."
Archaic-style_vase_with_fish_and_birds,"This jade vase faithfully copies a bronze vessel illustrated in the catalogue of the Qing imperial bronze collection. In 1753, the Qianlong emperor ordered the copy to be made in the imperial workshop in Suzhou. After the first success, several additional pieces were commissioned. The current one is likely one of them."
Basin_with_birds_in_a_lotus_pond,"Large bronze basins functioned as water containers for daily use and can be traced back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE). While the artist here drew inspiration from the traditional basin form, he modeled the tightly arranged lotus pond with birds after the popular motif used to decorate blue-and-white porcelain since the Yuan dynasty."
Incense_burner_with_peacock_and_peony,"Scenes of peacocks flying among peonies and trees were meticulously rendered with silver damascening over an iron body. Although this censer bears a Xuande reign mark on its base, the style of writing and the format depart from those of imperially commissioned bronzes of the Xuande era (1426–35). The much freer style of decorative motifs further indicates that it was likely made in Derge, East Tibet (now Gengqing, Sichuan Province), a center of damascening production."
Basin_with_lotus_pond,"Known as fahua (literally designs with borders), ceramics such as this one share a visual similarity with cloisonné enamel. A white clay paste (or slip) is used to create the outlines of motifs and then filled in with brightly colored enamels. Produced in both north (Shanxi) and south (Jingdezhen) China, fahua ware gained popularity in the late fifteenth to the sixteenth century, slightly later than cloisonné. This elegant work was designed as a small fish bowl or container for paper scrolls on a scholar’s desk."
"Bowl_with_pomegranates,_lotus_scrolls,_and_chrysanthemum_petals","Blue-and-white porcelain achieved new heights in the early Ming dynasty and was favored by imperial courtiers. The exquisite patterns on these porcelains, such as the lotus scrolls on the interior of this bowl, often reflect standard designs from the official workshop."
Box_with_Figures_in_Landscape,"The four characters on the cover read tianxia taiping, or “all is well under heaven,” a common wish often written on porcelains in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century."
Amphora,"Brilliantly colored lead glazes in shades of green, amber, and white, which are known as three-color, or sancai, glazes, were widely used in funerary goods in the late seventh and the first half of the eighth century. The shape of this ewer derives from the metalwork of the ancient Iranian world and illustrates the impact of trade along the famed Silk Road."
Large_wine_jar,"The inscription reads:Top line:三六學仕攤[貪]盃懶[攬]去登瀛州[洲]，二四神仙醉後不知歸洞府Eighteen scholars, in the thrall of their [wine] cups, are too lazy to ascend Yingzhou [to serve as officials]. Eight immortals, once they are drunk, know not how to return to their grottoes.Bottom line:紫府瓊漿，瑤池玉夜[液]Sweet wine of the Purple Abode, jade liquor of the Jasper Lake."
Plate_with_fish,"Close examination of the cobalt blue used to paint this dish shows areas of darker blue. Known as “heaped and piled,” this effect is a result of imperfect control of the pigment during firing. This effect disappeared in the early fifteenth century, when potters further mastered the use of this pigment."
Bowl_with_two_boys_and_foliage,"The deep conical bowl is finely and thinly potted, and is supported by a tapered foot. The incised and combed decoration, which fills the interior, shows two small, pudgy boys frolicking within a luxurious floral scroll. This scroll, which also contains peony blossoms, fills most of the interior of the dish with the exception of a small undecorated band at the rim. The base of the bowl is left partially unglazed. There are no marks or inscriptions on this bowl."
Plate_with_two_deer_amid_flowers,Ding ware porcelain is cherished for its unctuous white glaze and fine patterns created either from freehand carving or mold impression. The latter method was used here to depict two deer galloping amid a floral ground; the delicate pattern enhances the plate’s visual appeal.
Bottle,"Named after a prefecture in Hebei Province in north China, Ding wares were made from the eighth to the thirteenth or fourteenth century, and were popular at the Northern Song (960–1127) court. The shape of this base, which most likely derives from a silver piece, is extraordinarily difficult to make because the neck is so long and slender."
Vase_with_landscape_decoration,"Imperial workshops quickly excelled at producing polychrome enamels, and the ware won the court’s favor during the eighteenth century. New techniques from Europe made it possible to render colors on enamels with the same level of complexity and gradation as when painting on paper or silk. The elegant landscape encircling this vase represents such a success. The mint green ground with fine floral scrolls and gilding adds an extra layer of luxury to this exquisite vase."
Wine_container_(Hu),"As the Shang animal mask lost its symbolic meaning under the Zhou, it dissolved into an ornamental pattern, as here, where an “eye” is encircled by curving hooked lines."
Ritual_vessel_(gui),"In the Qianlong emperor’s color-coded system, this blue ceramic vessel was used in state rituals held at the Altar of Heaven in Beijing. In shape and decoration, it was modeled on an ancient bronze grain receptacle."
Tea_bowl_with_decoration_of_six-petaled_flowers,"Noted for its imaginative designs and innovative techniques, Jizhou ware was produced at kilns in Jiangxi Province in southern China. Here, paper-cut plum blossoms were placed on an initial layer of black glaze and covered with brown glaze. The paper cuts were destroyed during the firing, leaving the design of plum blossoms on the inside of the bowl.Noted for its imaginative designs and innovative techniques, Jizhou ware was produced at kilns in Jiangxi Province in southern China. Here, paper-cut plum blossoms were placed on an initial layer of black glaze and covered with brown glaze. The paper cuts were destroyed during the firing, leaving the design of plum blossoms on the inside of the bowl."
Vase_with_nine_peaches,"Featuring a range of opaque and transparent colors, this vase boasts a complex composition of nine peaches, an auspicious motif expressing a wish for longevity. This design was also used in enameled porcelain produced under the preceding Yongzheng period (1723–35). In this new iteration, the branches and leaves are shown in a denser array, the color of the peaches is brighter, and the number of fruits was often increased from eight to nine."
Dish_with_God_of_Longevity_(Shoulao)_and_an_attendant,"Reviving a technique that was pioneered in the fifteenth century, the artists who decorated this dish used overglaze enamels to fill in the underglaze blue outlines. While written documents of the period do not use a specific term to refer to this application, it is now known as doucai, or “joined colors.” Reclaiming the technique in the Yongzheng period was a way of showing continuity with lauded enameling traditions of the past, while introducing new layers of visual complexity in the composition of the interior and exterior surfaces of the dish."
Dish_with_peaches_and_bats,"The use of gold nanoparticles to create a pink color was a chemical process introduced to Guangzhou artisans by Europeans in the early eighteenth century. By 1716, skilled enamelers were requisitioned to work at the imperial workshops, where this new color was deployed onto ceramic and metal surfaces for courtly consumption. In a technique more usual for glaze application, the enameler has sprayed this pink enamel to create a naturalistic sense of ripening peaches."
Hexagonal_vase_with_cloud-shaped_handles,"Hexagonal vases are among the most prevalent type of flower vases deriving from archaic vessels in the Yuan dynasty. Like other fourteenth-century bronze vases, this example displays multiple intricately cast panels of archaic and contemporary motifs, such as the modified animal masks, vegetal scrolls, and lozenge pattern. Its long, flaring neck and pear-shaped body are unmistakable features of thirteenth- to fourteenth-century ceramics. However, its hexagonal form, readily created in cast bronze, influenced contemporary ceramics."
Flower_vase_with_animal-head_handles,"The imposing entwined dragons on this vessel’s belly and the wave patterns on its foot and neck are derived from woodcut illustrations in antiquarian catalogues. Not satisfied with merely copying ancient bronzes, the Yuan designer rejected the squat form and flaring mouth of the archaic model and instead cast an elongated, tapered neck better suited to the vessel’s function as a flower vase. Its dragon handles are also transformed, recalling nomadic designs on metalwork from the Mongol Yuan dynasty."
"Ritual_bell,_note_nanlu?","Often juxtaposed with a set of jade chimes, bronze bells were suspended from wooden frames and played at state ceremonies and banquets. The Qianlong emperor was prolific in commissioning chime sets for state altars and palaces. This current piece features openwork suspension crowns and geometric patterns for which no precedent among chime bells is known."
Table_screen_with_woman_playing_touhu,"The touhu game was traditionally designed as a way for players to focus their thoughts and achieve a peaceful mental state, in keeping with the Confucian moral requirement that gentlemen pursue harmony and benevolence. As illustrated in this table screen, the game was not limited to male elites: here, an elegant lady enjoys the game by herself in a garden setting."
Tripod_incense_burner_with_lid,"This incense burner features two types of enameling: cloisonné on the body and champlevé on the handles. The latter method requires artists to carve enclosures into the metal body that were then filled with enamel color paste, instead of using copper wires to create compartments for the enamel, as in cloisonné. The visual appeal of enamel’s vivid colors inspired a new polychrome palette across Ming art."
Vase_with_geometric_patterns,"This slender vase has a rectangular section on a splayed foot, with two cloud-shaped handles attached to the sides of its neck. All four sides of the vase are decorated, from neck to foot, with geometric patterns, including honeycomb diaper, floret-and-dots diaper, diamond diaper, and pendant lappets. The entire vessel is covered with a warm blackish patina that bears no trace of being buried underground."
Bowl_with_dragons_amid_waves,"In the West, the term “celadon” describes green-glazed ceramics. In China, stoneware with celadon glaze is classified by the name of the kiln where it was produced. This large bowl with three dragons frolicking in waves comes from the Yue kilns in Zhejiang Province, which began making celadons as early as the second century BCE. So-called Yue ware was used domestically as well as traded; examples have been found across Asia and as far west as Africa."
Female_Dancer,"This figure vividly captures the moment when, with one long sleeve thrown back and the other trailing down, a dancer gently stoops and flexes her knees as she lifts one heel to advance her step, performing a dance described in Han dynasty poetry:“Their long sleeves, twirling and twisting,fill the hall;Gauze-stocking feet…taking mincing steps,Move with slow and easy gaitThey hover about long and continuous, as ifStopped in mid-air;Dazed, one thinks they are about to fall…”"
Brush_rest_in_the_shape_of_a_mountain,"Shaped like a miniature rugged mountain, this bronze brush rest is both functional and symbolic of literati ideals. Its five-peaked shape creates valleys in which to rest multiple brushes. Since ancient times, mountains were associated with the homes of wonderful immortals and hermits. Literati viewed mountains as the perfect place of retreat during turbulent times."
Altar_vase_(one_of_a_pair),"These vases’ bulbous bodies and cloud-shaped loop handles with rings resonate stylistically with the Ming imperial altar vase at the Qutan Monastery. Although they bear no reign marks or gilding, their imposing form and fine casting indicate that they were products of the imperial workshops of the fifteenth century. Originally, they served as flower vases on a ritual altar, where they would have been placed together with an incense burner and two candlesticks."

Originally, they served as flower vases on a ritual altar, where they would have been placed together with an incense burner and two candlesticks."
Tripod_incense_burner_with_makara,"Resting on three feet in the form of elephant heads, this incense burner features three long-snout dragons circling its body. Derived from Indic makara, this type of mythical creature was introduced into China via Tibetan Buddhism from the thirteenth century. Popular in the Ming court, makara dragons were widely found on stone carvings, porcelain, and cloisonné works throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries."
"Foliated_plate_with_rocks,_plants,_and_melons","At the center of this plate is a scene of leafy plants, rocks, and melons surrounded by a ring of lotus scrolls. Such a vibrant and ordered composition sets the plate apart from the subtly hued monochrome glazes of Song ceramics. In the fourteenth century, potters at Jingdezhen mastered the technique of decorating porcelain with cobalt-blue pigment under a transparent glaze. The various blue hues and shading of the rocks here showcase the potter’s skill in the use of the brush."
Flask,"The dramatic blue splash over the brown glaze on this bottle prefigures the use of copper to create similar designs in later ceramics, particularly Jun ware produced in Henan Province in north China from the ninth to the fifteenth century."
Quadrangular_vase_in_the_shape_of_a_Neolithic_cong,"The shape of this vase derives from that of Neolithic jades and illustrates that antiquarian interest was not limited to ancient bronzes during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Unlike its jade prototype, which is an open tube, this celadon version has a solid base and has been given a new function as a flower vase for a scholar’s studio."
Vase_with_auspicious_animals,"Many animal patterns appear on decorative arts, including cloisonné enamel, from the sixteenth century onward. These creatures were often imbued with auspicious meanings. Here, cranes symbolize longevity, and peafowls represent fortune. Some of them even created visual puns by using homophones. One side of this vase features magpie, deer, and monkeys, which represent “giving great wealth and bestowing a noble title.”"
Weight_in_the_shape_of_a_chimera,"This miniature sculpture was originally used as a mat weight, a functional ornament in ancient China. Typically appearing in sets of four, such weights held down the corners of mats that were positioned on the floor or over low-footed daybeds—a common form of seating. In later periods, these ancient treasures were repurposed as paperweights and produced for scholar’s studios."
Female_musician_with_lute,"Ensembles featuring female musicians often served as a musical bridge between elite and popular culture. As expert musicians, they were often musical innovators. Here, a small ensemble is shown (23.180.4–.7), clapping and playing the pipa, tongbo (small copper cymbals), and konghou (harp). The pipa is played in its original position, like an Arabic lute; its silk strings are plucked with a triangular plectrum. The construction and playing style resemble those of the biwa, a Japanese lute derived from the pipa. Today, the biwa maintains the use of a triangular plectrum, the West Asian plectrum guard, and the C-shaped sound holes seen on the instrument played by the musician here as well as on the jade belt featured in this case. The Chinese playing style changed during the chaotic Later Tang period (921–36), when the plectrum was discarded. The angular konghou harp, introduced at the end of the Han dynasty, was in decline at this time and had gone completely out of use by the end of the Tang.The highest-rated musicians at the Tang court performed seated, while the lower ranks played standing and were also treated less well in other respects."
Snuff_bottle_with_flowers_and_rocks,"This snuff bottle displays an opaque white background and poetic inscriptions on its back, which, together with a shared use of enamel, reflects the ties between the glass workshops in Beijing and the kilns at Jingdezhen. Visually, it resembles a small group of eighteenth-century imperial white porcelain with fine enamel painting combining painting and poem. Such porcelains were painted at the court in Beijing rather than at the Jingdezhen kilns farther south."
Disk_with_dragons,"This disc either may have been used as inlay to decorate another a piece of furniture or a screen, or functioned as an independent work of art. Known as chihulong, the four snakelike dragons—two large, two small—prowling along the surface are identifiable by their long, narrow necks, the raised lines across their backs, and their branching tails."
Wine_container_(hu),"A portion of this vessel’s surface has retained its original corrosion-free brassy color. The triangular forms around the rim are inlaid with copper, which has turned dark and is partially covered by green corrosion."
Seal_with_mantra_in_Vartu_script,"Written in Vartu script, the six characters engraved on the bottom of this seal read ""aa-ra-pa-tza-na-dhi,"" which is a mantra of Manjusri, the bodhisattva of wisdom. First developed in India, Vartu script was adapted from cursive Sanskrit by Tibetan monks for ritual use from the eleventh century onward."
Vase_with_archaistic_design,"This finely cast vase resembles an ancient wine container illustrated in antiquarian catalogues. In keeping with its new function as a vase, however, its body has been elongated, and its cross section flattened. The ornamental bands were freely taken from various objects from different ancient periods. This work is a creative reinterpretation rather than a literal copy of the decorative patterns derived from archaic bronzes, indicative of the new aesthetic that accompanied the vessel’s new function."
"Incense_burner_with_dragon,_phoenix,_and_sea_creatures","The surface of this incense burner is decorated with mythical creatures moving in and out of the waves in high relief. Combining the techniques of openwork and relief, its lid features a dragon and phoenix soaring among clouds. In the late Ming dynasty, connoisseurs praised the perfect casting of imperial bronzes made in the Xuande era (1426–35). The artist here added a Xuande mark to its bottom as an attempt to imitate the legendary bronzes."
One_of_a_Pair_of_Vases_with_Dragon_Handles,"Cloisonné is a technique for creating designs on metal whereby enclosures made from copper or bronze wire that has been bent or hammered into a desired pattern are filled with colored glass paste. Known as cloisons (French for ""partitions""), the enclosures are generally pasted or soldered onto the metal body. The glass paste, or enamel, is colored with metallic oxide and painted into the contained areas. The vessel is then fired, usually at a relatively low temperature, about 800 degrees centigrade. As enamels commonly shrink during firing, the process has to be repeated several times to fill the entire design. Once this process is completed, the surface of the vessel is burnished until the edges of the cloisons are visible."
Vase_with_poems_in_a_panoramic_landscape,"This vase is a unique memento of a literary gathering at the ceramic production center Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, in the 1690s. Its surface is richly decorated with figure groups and local scenic sites, all rendered with precision and sensitivity. Most remarkable are the transcriptions of an essay and ten poems that grace the sky and the rock faces. Collectively they relate a true story of strangers becoming friends across traditional class boundaries. A visiting official named Shang Ancun, known for his poems on local scenery, met two local scholars who presented their own poems on the subject, and friendship was born. In their company was a master potter also adept at poetry and painting. He painted the vase, including the transcriptions of poems composed on the occasion (one by him), thereby transforming a private exchange into a lasting artwork."
Covered_box_with_catfish,"The ingenious design and impeccable craftsmanship of this box reflect the technological and artistic excellence achieved in China’s glass industry in the eighteenth century. Its humorous decoration forms an auspicious rebus: “catfish” (nianyu) rhymes with “year” (nian) and “abundance” (yu), thereby conveying a wish for “abundance year after year.”"
"Guardian,_probably_a_Lokapala_(Tian_wang)","Guardians of various types play an important role in religious imagery, literature, and the performing and visual arts. This figure is most likely one of the four heavenly protectors of Buddhism who serve as guardians of the cardinal directions."
Plate_with_birds_and_flowers,"As the first point of contact between Europe and China, Canton (now Guangzhou) was a center of enamel production and distribution throughout the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries. Wares from the city’s workshops, known as “Canton enamels,” commonly featured popular motifs based on court designs from Beijing. One of the most favored examples depicts lively birds and flowers surrounded by a dense floral border. This design can be found on enameled porcelain created for both domestic and export markets."
Cup_with_floral_scrolls,"The practice of using painted enamels and gilding to imitate the appearance of cloisonné began during the Qianlong reign, a period in which the imitative capacities of enamels were deployed to reproduce a variety of media. Such playful emulations were the result of technical mastery and experimentation, and were encouraged at the Qing imperial workshops."
Covered_box_with_hibiscus_and_grapevines,"This box exemplifies the highest quality cloisonné produced by the imperial Ming workshop. In addition to the stylized lotus scrolls commonly seen on earlier works, it features a naturalistic depiction of flowers and fruit. To create the subtle color variations on the leaves, artists used a sophisticated process of mixing yellow, green, and red enamels. These representations date this piece to the mid-fifteenth century, most likely the legendary Jingtai era (1450–57)—a golden age of cloisonné enamel production in China."
Horse_groom,"This Central Asian groom's attire, consisting of a short coat with wide lapels and trousers tucked into knee-high boots, originated in Western Asia."
Spouted_water_container_(He,"The animal motifs on most Shang and Western Zhou bronzes are composites of different animals and birds, as if these creatures were undergoing a continuous metamorphosis. Here, bovine horns have been attached to a feline face. The same eight-character inscription is cast on the body of the vessel beneath the handle and on the inside of the lid: “[clan sign] Yi [have had] a precious sacred vessel made for deceased father.”"
Bowl_(one_of_a_pair),"Like this piece, most Jun wares were fired twice to get the effect of the thick, soft blue glaze. Purple splashes are produced by adding copper oxide to the glaze."
Vase_with_Dragon_Handles,"A glaze is formed when clay fired onto the surface of porcelain melts into a glasslike substance that fuses with the ceramic body, strengthening it. The lushness of the glaze covering this vase and the skillful manipulation of its color, created by controlling oxygen supply during firing, creates a sense of texture and depth similar to that found in porcelain with painted or incised decoration."
Ewer_with_phoenix,"This unique ewer, with its added decoration of a small figure on the handle and its fanciful spout and legs, illustrates the interest in complicated forms found in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in north China. Although they are not listed among the official kilns of the Northern and Southern Song dynasties, historical sources indicate that Yaozhou wares were also produced for imperial use."
Dish_with_Scalloped_Rim,"Often inspired by contemporaneous silver shapes, Ding wares are noted for their thin bodies and elegant ivory glazes. Cited as one of the five wares sent to the imperial court during the Northern Song dynasties, Ding wares were produced from the tenth to the thirteenth century and were often emulated in later traditions."
Square_vase_with_flowers_of_four_seasons,"This square vase is likely an example of famille noire ware produced before the late nineteenth century, when some individuals believe such vessels were first created for the Western market. A pair of similar square vases now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, have an early record stating that they were in England no later than 1854, decades before the fashion of famille noire began."
Vase,"Clear glass was likely initially produced at the Qing court to create lenses for telescopes and other practical tools before being put to more decorative use through the creation of small bottles, boxes, and vases. Since glass and enamel share a similar chemical composition, the cobalt pigment that lends this vessel its deep blue color was likely also used in enameling of the period."
Double_vessel_with_mythical_beasts_(champion_vase),"This type of vessel, with two narrow vertical compartments connected by a carving of a mythical bird, is known as a “champion vase” in Western writings. The name may be a loose translation of yingxiongbei, or “hero’s cup,” referring to the eagle (ying) and the bear (xiong) supporting it. Based on an archaic bronze type that can be traced back to the second century BCE, champion vases were revived beginning in the sixteenth century and were subsequently manufactured in different media, including cloisonné, jade, and rhinoceros horn."
Vase,"This vase features a garden scene of women enjoying fragrant flowers, burning incense, and playing with children. The rich colors, including the deep blue shade, were applied with polychromatic enamels over the glaze. Prior to the late seventeenth century, blue on porcelain was achieved through the use of cobalt under the glaze."
Vase,"Known as gu, this type of ritual vessel was used for pouring wine during the Shang dynasty (ca. 1600–1046 B.C.). The earliest objects were cast in bronze, while later artists adopted the shape for pieces in a variety of media. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, the gu beaker and other archaistic types were produced in cloisonné and painted enamels and were repurposed as display items or flower vases in environments where their allusions to earlier ritual functions were appreciated."
Daoist_deity_Zhenwu,"The Daoist god known as Zhenwu is the personification of the ancient symbol of the north, an entwined tortoise and snake. In the eleventh century this powerful symbol was given a human form by the Song emperors, who erected temples to worship the deity. Zhenwu became particularly popular during the Ming dynasty, when he was revered as a protector of the empire and the imperial family. This figure was created for personal veneration on a home altar."
Vase_in_the_form_of_an_archaic_wine_vessel_(fangzun),"The booming of the antique market offered new prototypes for cloisonné works during the late Ming dynasty. Shapes and patterns based on ancient ritual bronzes were widely used, but the enamels created a colorful effect never before seen on earlier works."
Wine_container_(hu),"A significant change took place in bronze décor during the middle of the Han dynasty, when depictions of landscape and animals were either painted or incised rather than cast. Incised decoration not only points to a change in aesthetics, but also reflects the development of iron tools, which made engraving bronze surfaces possible."
Cup_with_narrative_scene_from_the_“Legend_of_the_White_Snake”,"The dramatic scene on this porcelain cup depicts an exciting episode in the popular folktale the “Legend of the White Snake.” Incarnated as a woman warrior, the White Snake stands on the front of a boat and wields two swords, fighting against the cold-hearted abbot who abducted her husband and kept him in his monastery. Numerous deities from the sea, including the spirits of clams, crabs, fish, shrimp, and turtles, join her heroic endeavor."
Stele_for_the_Confucius_Temple,"The stele from which this ink rubbing was taken records that the thirty-third-generation grandson of Confucius was given the title Marquis Baode in 626; it also documents the subsequent reconstruction of the Confucian temple in Qufu. A Confucian temple is the central place to host various rites showing respect to Confucius and Confucianism, the core ideology in China for the past two thousand years. The original stele was inscribed by the famous calligrapher Yu Shinan (558–638) but is now long lost. This current ink rubbing was taken from a tenth-century copy now erected at the Stele Forest Museum in Xi’an."
Candlestick_with_lotus_scrolls,"This candlestick originally included a tube-shaped candleholder that rose from the center of the dish. A metal medallion was later added to cover the missing part, transforming the piece into a stem dish. Its pattern styles and enamel coloring identify it as an early Ming cloisonné work."
Double_cup_with_mythical_beasts,"The origin of this vessel, often called a “champion vase” in Western scholarship, remains unclear. It is possible that the term is a loose translation of the phrase yingxiong bei, or hero’s cup, a reference to the bird (ying) and bear (xiong) depicted on the front. The dragon-headed scroll pattern that covers the surface is based on imagery found during the Shang (ca. 1600–1046 B.C.) and Zhou (1054–256 B.C.) dynasties. It was most likely adapted from woodblock-print illustrations of antiquities."
Vase_with_elephant-headed_handles,"This vase turns away from the dense decoration of archaistic bronzes yet conveys an antique look. The bladelike motifs derive from ancient ritual bronzes, but the long flaring neck and bulbous body are features of thirteenth- to fifteenth-century ceramics. Notably, its handles feature elephant heads, a sacred animal in Buddhism. This decor would have been appropriate as a flower vase for Buddhist practitioners or in a monastery."
Vase_with_archaic-style_motifs,"This extravagant vase epitomizes the innovative spirit of archaistic bronze design in the fourteenth century. The clever form makes the vessel appear much larger than its actual size. The illusion of height is created by its elongated neck, tall foot, and outward-curving handles."
Square_vase_with_archaic-style_motifs_(fangzun),"This vase exhibits a monumentality that belies its small size. Its square shape—most such vessels are round—further adds to its assertive presence, as does its crisply cast bold decor. Combining the decorative patterns of the Shang, Zhou, and Han periods (ca. 1600 BCE–220 CE), the vase conveys a hybrid style that distinguishes it as a “new antique” rather than either a faithful copy or a fake. Covered in a lustrous dark patina, its linear design allows it to hold flower branches, typical of those vases circulating in Japan since the fourteenth century."
Vase_with_openwork_pattern_of_flowers,"This exquisite vase is among the finest enamel wares produced by the imperial porcelain factory in the eighteenth century. The then-newly invented pink enamel is a colorful ground for the flower scrolls that frame the four roundels featuring auspicious plants. The Nandina bush (nantianzhu), Narcissus flowers (shuixian), and Ganoderma mushrooms (magic fungus or lingzhi) serve as a visual pun for the phrase “heavenly immortals’ greeting of longevity” (tianxian zhishou). Not only found on porcelain, the floral openwork design was also popular on enameled copper alloy works."
Coin_inscribed_“Chong_Ning_Tong_Bao”,"The characters on this coin exhibit Emperor Huizong’s distinctive calligraphic style, known as “slender gold” because it resembled finely spun filaments of the precious metal. Huizong made an effort to present himself as a man of cultivated tastes through various means. His writings were often carved in stone or metal, as here, and circulated widely among the public."
Table_screen_with_immortals,"Luxury writing accessories with religious subjects were used by literati to manifest their wishes. This tabletop screen, which protects inkstone from dust, illustrates a popular Daoist subject. The deity of longevity (Shoulao), identified by his prominent bald cranium, sits on a garden rock. The eight immortals stand in two lines and greet him on his birthday with various gifts. Below the rock pedestal, four incised characters convey every scholar’s aspiration: ci jinshi di, or “confer the jinshi degree,” the highest degree in the imperial civil service exam."
Mirror,"Huzhou was a center of bronze mirror production from the Song through the Qing dynasty. This eight-lobed mirror is a classic type from Huzhou that recalls the forms of contemporary ceramics, lacquers, and silver ware. The mark on the back reads: “Authentic mirror by the twenty-second uncle of the Shi family from Huzhou.” The word “authentic” is a testimony to the robust demand for these objects in a market in which imitations had already become common."
Bodhisattva_Guanyin,"The child in the arms of the bodhisattva indicates that this ivory carving represents Guanyin as the Bestower of Sons. Although in India the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara was originally understood to be either genderless or male, in China, female manifestations developed and become popular, particularly for their ability to provide blessings such as children. This particular form was created during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644)."
Bodhisattva_Skanda,"Skanda, known as Weituo in Chinese, is a Buddhist guardian deity. He is always depicted as a young and robust warrior in full armor."
Wine_beaker_(Gu),"This tall, slender wine beaker has a dramatic profile that curves in an unbroken arc from rim to foot. Three horizontal registers of decoration, separated by narrow bands of raised lines, create an articulated surface. The top register consists of four tapering blades of ornament that emphasize the graceful upward curve of the flaring neck. The middle and bottom registers are composed of bold taotie masks raised on a ground filled with squarish spirals. The wide band that define both the mouth rim and molded foot further enhance the substantial appearance of the vessel. Cast on the interior side of the foot is an inscription that reads, “X X fu ding” (X X Father Ding)."
Food_serving_vessel_(dou),"A subtle all-over pattern of interwoven bands complements the graceful shape of this vessel, which is further adorned by the four nearly naturalistic feline handles."
"Dish_with_flowers,_fruits,_and_butterfly","Encircled by a tightly arranged geometric and floral border, the center of this dish features auspicious fruits and flowers accompanied by a butterfly. Such openwork design is commonly found on both painted enamel on copper alloy and enameled porcelain in the mid-eighteenth century."
Bowl_with_flowers,"This thin, almost translucent bowl represents the height of porcelain manufacture under the Yongzheng emperor. Possibly reflecting the use of paper sketches as models for enamel decoration, the floral design blooms on the exterior surface before wrapping over the rim into the inside of the vessel. The enameler embraced the use of blank space to draw attention to the naturalistic qualities of the painted flowers."
Incense_holder_with_scholars_in_a_landscape,The ubiquitous motif of scholars in the midst of a remote landscape is elegantly carved on the surface of this incense holder. The openwork decoration facilitates the release of fragrance from incense sticks burning inside.
Vase_with_scenes_from_Romance_of_the_West_Chamber,"The scenes on this vase come from Romance of the West Chamber, arguably China’s most popular romantic play. Written by Wang Shifu (ca. 1260–1336), the play tells the story of two star-crossed lovers. Zhang Gong is an impoverished young scholar, and Cui Yingying is the daughter of a high-ranking official. After many romantic experiences and dramatic difficulties, some of which are depicted on this vase, the two lovers eventually get married."
Dish_with_pheasant_and_flowers_on_fan,The layering of designs on this dish illustrates the dense and precise decoration that typifies the art of the Qianlong period in China. A short-handled fan with a pheasant perched on a flowering branch fills the center of the open space. The ornamental patterns on the edges of the fan and the rim of the plate are also characteristic of the eighteenth century.
Tripod_incense_burner,"Ancient ritual bronzes often served as prototypes for later metalwork, particularly those with ritual or ceremonial functions. The shape of this piece is based on an archaic tripod vessel known as a ding, which was used for holding or serving food and other offerings; however, this object functioned as an incense burner. The six-character mark on the raised gilt-bronze plaque identifies that it was from the imperial workshop in Beijing."
Gourd-shaped_vase_with_gourds_on_vines_and_bats,"Beyond the appeal of its sinuous form and elegant blue-and-white decoration, this gourd-shaped vase would have been treasured for the layers of auspicious meaning encoded in its decoration. The image of gourds on vines is a rebus, or visual word puzzle, for “fortune and prosperity through ten thousand generations” (fulu wandai), while the combination of bats and gourds forms a second rebus for “good fortune and wealth” (fulu)."
Snuff_bottle_with_eagle_and_bear,The combination of an eagle and a bear is a Chinese rebus for hero or champion.
Animal_Pen_with_Figures,"This animal pen is populated with goats, tended to with one hand by a mother who cradles an infant in her other arm. It is typical of mingqi or ""spirit utensils"" that accompanied the deceased in burials of the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 A.D.). Replicas of farm animals, utilitarian objects, and entertainers were believed to provide nourishment and amusement for the soul of the tomb occupant. The elevated structure serves as an architectural record of rustic buildings that would have been part of a large agricultural estate, and preserves in clay details of wooden design and construction—such as the low-pitched roof with a series of wood rafters flanging from a central beam—that have long since disintegrated above ground.The popularization of mingqi over the course of the Han dynasty (206 B.C.–220 A.D.) reflects dramatic changes in Chinese society, illustrating how power circulated beyond the imperial government and nobility to a broader bureaucratic class. In the early years of the Han, Confucianism emerged as the dominant philosophy and the empire became dependent on a class of scholar-officials. They desired gratification for themselves and their families in the afterlife and plentiful clay, fashioned into models ranging from crude earthenware to fine glazed stoneware, was the ideal medium for furnishing mingqi in burials across a swath of social strata."
Dish_with_Flowering_Plum_and_Birds,"Flowering plums and birds, possibly magpies, a popular theme in the paining and poetry of the Southern Song dynasty (1279–1368), were understood as harbingers of spring, because the plum is one of the first blossoms to appear as winter ends. This depiction of plum blossoms, which range from buds to full blooms, derives from the influential Manual of Plum Blossom Likeness (Meihua xishen pu), written by the artist Song Boren in the mid-thirteenth century, which discusses and illustrates the different stages in the life of this delicate flower."
Table_screen_with_the_gathering_in_the_Western_Garden,"Five groups of figures are nestled in the tree-lined garden on this screen, which would have been displayed in a scholar’s studio. The scene recalls a famous literary gathering held in the Western Garden in 1087. The figure writing on a cliff, at right, appears to be the legendary scholar-official Mi Fu (1051–1107)."
Quadrangular_vase_in_the_shape_of_a_Neolithic_cong,"By the thirteenth century, the jade cong form was reinterpreted as a flower vase in both bronze and ceramic art. In contrast to the subtle celadon glaze on ceramic vases, bronze vases are filled with archaic squared spirals as well as contemporaneous motifs such as waves and scrolling patterns."
Vase_with_waves_and_animal_masks,"With its long neck and round body, this flower vase takes the form of a ritual wine container (hu), first produced in China during the Shang (ca. 1600–1046 BCE) and Zhou (ca. 1046–256 BCE) dynasties. The mask-like imagery on its lower section has similar roots. Such details reveal the growing popularity of antiquarianism in China from the twelfth to the fourteenth century. The pattern of cresting waves at the top of the vase, on the other hand, is a motif faithful to contemporary paintings, ceramics, and other art forms."
Vase_with_Daoist_Immortals,"This shape first appeared in Chinese ceramics in the fourteenth century, and is often used in temples and other public spaces."
Vase_with_Figures_in_Landscape,"Although the source has not yet been identified, it seems likely that the scene painted on this vase illustrates a moment from a play or a novel, possibly a work with romantic overtones. In the center of the vase, a gentleman with three attendants appears to be shooing another man off his property. At the upper right, a young woman, probably a female member of the house, is peeking through an open doorway. It is easy to imagine an outraged father or husband stumbling across an assignation of some type."
Tripod_incense_burner,"Emperor Qianlong’s interest in antiquarianism influenced the design of decorative artworks in the court. This incense burner follows the shape of a bronze tripod ding vessel. The colorful floral scrolls in cloisonné enamel are enhanced by the gilded relief band at the center, which is decorated with a pattern inspired by the animal-mask design ubiquitous in ancient imagery."
Incense_burner_with_fish-shaped_handles,"Connoisseurs particularly admired the lustrous surface and sublime patina of legendary bronze incense burners of the Xuande era (1426–35). Numerous incense burners bear Xuande marks, which do not necessarily indicate their actual production date but rather serve as an homage to a past glory. Decorated with a smooth red and gold patina, this censer would have been handled by literati in their studios and cherished as a fashionable pastime."
Bowl,"This type of bowl, with a thin body and a highly schematized representation of a port town painted in vivid underglaze blue, is a standard example of late-sixteenth-century export ware from Jingdezhen. Large numbers of these bowls have been found in Southeast Asia in recent decades. Its comparative rarity in Europe is evidenced by the addition of gilt-silver mounts, which also increase its usefulness."
Bowl_with_the_Eight_Buddhist_Treasures,"Replete with Buddhist iconography, this large bowl was likely intended to hold offerings on an altar table. The exterior features bold lotus flowers in alternating colors, while the interior shows the Eight Buddhist Treasures: wheel, conch, parasol, canopy, flower, precious vase, two fish, and endless knot. At the bottom of the bowl, two carp swim in a pond, its dark waters contrasting with the luminous gilding of the cloisonné wires."
Vase_with_Peony_Scrolls,"Developed at the Longquan kilns in the late thirteenth century, this type of vase was produced there well into the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). The decoration of molded peonies is an innovation of these kilns, and is frequently found on works produced there in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The large size of this type of vase suggests that it was used in public spaces such as temples and reception halls."
Tripod_incense_burner,"This Yuan bronze creatively reinterprets and transforms the austere form and complex decor of ancient food vessels into a simpler, more modestly proportioned incense burner that evokes rather than replicates ancient prototypes. Likewise, the band of stylized dragons that encircles its belly derives from antique models but is cast in low relief, which greatly enhances the tactile pleasure of handling the vessel."
"Ritual_bell_with_archaistic_design,_note_guxi","In 1761, the Qianlong emperor ordered the casting of twelve-piece sets of gilt bronze bells based on recently discovered ancient bells from Jiangxi. Whereas the sixteen-bell chime sets were played together, each bell in the new set was played on its own, only during its corresponding month, such as the one here for the third lunar month. It would be struck once to announce the start of movements of the state ritual music Melody of Harmony."
Ritual_wine_cup_(jue),"Not all Ming ritual bronzes were based on antique models. The smooth shape of this tripod cup dating to 1520 closely follows contemporary reinterpretations in ceramics of this ancient vessel type. Furthermore, the inscription is rendered in standard script rather than in an archaic bronze or seal script.Inscription知縣張淮、教諭丘渲、 訓導潘昂、丁獻，大明正德庚辰年造Zhang Huai, the [Shanggao] county magistrate, Qiu Xuan, the county academy instructor, Pan Ang and Ding Xian, the assistant instructors of the county academy, manufactured [this vessel] in the gengchen year of Zhengde reign of the Great Ming [1520]."
Rectangular_tray_with_flowering_plums_and_birds,"The wonderful flowering plum tree and two plump birds that fill the center of this tray illustrate the skillful manipulation of shapes and colors of the inlaid motherof-pearl to create a powerful, dramatic scene. Long narrow pieces of iridescent shell define the rock terrain, while irregular pieces form the clump of rocks in front of the trunk of the flowering plum. Fragments of mother-of-pearl create the craggy trunk of the ancient tree, which bears buds in several stages of flowering."
"Ritual_bell,_note_jiazhong","After the stabilization of the country, Emperor Kangxi implemented a reform of ceremonial music in 1713. Sets of chime bells were collectively capable of producing twelve full notes and four double notes. These bells feature contemporary designs, not archaic motifs: either dragons among clouds or the eight trigrams, as here. Heavily cast with crisp ornament in high relief, this fully gilt bell demonstrates the superb craftsmanship of the imperial commission."
Avalokiteshvara_as_Shadakshari_Lokeshvara,"Woven in a single color, this temple hanging represents Shadakshari Lokeshvara, a four-armed variant of the bodhisattva of compassion (Avalokiteshvara). Parallel to the gilt bronze images made in the imperial workshop of the Ming dynasty, the bodhisattva sits on a tiered throne and is adorned with exquisite jewelry and an elaborate mandorla. The bodhisattva personifies the six-character Sanskrit invocation om mani padme hum (hail to the jewel in the lotus), which is woven at the top of the hanging beneath the seed syllable hrih."
Tomb_guardian,"Although he obviously represents a racial group from the West, this armor-clad warrior stood sentinel in a Chinese tomb to protect its inhabitant from harm."
Civil_official,"Despite the fact that they undoubtedly depict foreigners of Western origin, these officials are dressed in the typical Tang-dynasty Chinese court dress of a long, wide-sleeved tunic over a long gown. Their hats illustrate two varieties of the standard headgear of Tang-dynasty Chinese court officials."
Food_serving_vessel_(Dou),Pottery vessels such as this were created expressly for burial as substitutes for bronze or lacquer utensils. Comparable examples have been excavated in the Zhongshan State tombs in Hebei Province.
Civil_official,"Despite the fact that they undoubtedly depict foreigners of Western origin, these officials are dressed in the typical Tang-dynasty Chinese court dress of a long, wide-sleeved tunic over a long gown. Their hats illustrate two varieties of the standard headgear of Tang-dynasty Chinese court officials."
Tomb_Guardian_(Zhenmushou),"Bulging eyes, a gaping mouth with fangs, a protruding tongue, oversized paws, and a spiked back define this fantastic creature, which was once one of a pair placed facing outward at the entrance to the coffin chamber."
Vase_with_Basket_of_Auspicious_Flowers,"This vase, its mate, and the large jar with the same decoration were most likely made for use in a European home, where they would have been displayed on a mantle or shelf."
Jar_with_Basket_of_Auspicious_Flowers,"In some of the porcelain on view, the color green predominates in the painted decoration. In others, such as this jar, it is shades of pink that dominate. As a result, porcelains painted with this palette have generally been known as famille rose (pink family) in Western writings."
Vase_in_Shape_of_Archaic_Bronze_Vessel,"The shape, the two stylized elephant’s heads supporting the rings at the sides, and the decoration carved into the surface allude to the forms and designs found in some of China’s earliest bronze vessels, produced during the Shang (ca. 1600–1050 B.C.) and Zhou (ca. 1050–256 B.C.) dynasties. These early vessels, which were used in court and ancestral rituals, were re-created in porcelain and other media for centuries."
"Tea_Bowl_with_Crescent_Moon,_Clouds,_and_Blossoming_Plum","A common theme in the decorative arts, this imagery may have been inspired by contemporaneous poems invoking the beauty of blossoming flowers in the subtle light of a crescent moon."
Vase_with_abstract_scroll_decoration,"Cizhou wares were domestic wares produced and used throughout north China. They were made as well at a few kilns in Inner Mongolia, and the combination of the sketchy incising with the use of a darker glaze in the central register suggests that this towering vase was made in the northeast."
Brush_Rest_with_Persian_Inscription,"The inscription on the brush holder reads “pen” on one side, and “holder” on the other."
Pillow_in_Shape_of_Reclining_Woman,"The making of ceramic pillows is one of the more interesting results of the dramatic increase in the use of ceramic goods in China from the ninth to the fourteenth century. Produced in many of the kiln complexes throughout China, these uncomfortable-looking pillows were widely used, and are sometimes explained as neck rests intended to protect a woman’s elaborate coiffure while she slept."
Bottle_with_vegetal_scrolls,"Known as Qingbai, literally bluish-white, this type of porcelain features a jade-like glaze surface, often with fluent carving decoration, such as vegetal scrolls on this vase. Qingbai porcelain was a dominant product from Jingdezhen, a major ceramic center in south China, from the twelfth to the thirteenth century. These objects were not only widely produced for the domestic market but also for export to Japan, Southeast Asia, and as far as East Africa."
Jar_with_Peony_Scroll,"Also known as “northern celadon,” Yaozhou wares were produced in numerous kilns centered in Shaanxi Province."
Bowl,"Although this porcelain bowl appears at first glance to be relatively modest, in the ninth century it was the most technically advanced ceramic in the world. Similar bowls, traded to centers such as the Abbasid court in Baghdad, were described in early Islamic poetry as having the luster of a pearl or of the moon."
Basin_with_Lotus_Decoration,"The lively lotuses, leaves, and stems that fill the interior of this basin were carved and incised by hand prior to the glazing and firing of the basin. Because of their thinness, these wares are often fired upside down to spread weight and prevent distortion. The metal rim covers the part of the bowl that was left unglazed for firing."
Jar_(Guan),"This type of high-fired, hard-bodied pottery was produced mostly in regions along the Yangzi River and its tributaries in southern and southeastern China."
Jar_with_dragon,"White porcelain painted with cobalt blue, a style that first flourished in China in the fourteenth century, is arguably the most important development in the history of ceramics. Commissioned by the court, this spectacular storage jar, made in the kilns in Jingdezhen, is dated to the rule of the Xuande emperor by an inscription on its shoulder. Its painted decoration features an animated dragon undulating across a sparsely clouded sky."
"Dish_with_persimmons,_flowers,_and_birds","The blue used in the depiction of the magpie was created using an oil-based pigment that allowed for the development of additional colors in the design of Chinese lacquers. Such pigments, to which a lead oxide is added as a drying agent, are known as litharge in Western writings, and as mituoseng in Chinese."
Bodhisattva_Avalokiteshvara_(Guanyin),"This bodhisattva can be identified as Avalokiteshvara by the small sculpture of a Buddha on his headdress and by the vessel he holds in his right hand. The shape of this vessel, particularly its bird’s-head top, typifies metalwork and ceramics produced in China in the late seventh and early eighth centuries."
Tripod_cauldron_(ding),Four characters are cast on the inner wall of the vessel: “X [Zu?] Ce [clan sign] [made for] deceased father Gui.”
Bodhisattva_Avalokiteshvara_(Guanyin),"This sculpture is one of the earliest known examples of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara holding a willow branch. The willow, which later becomes standard in the imagery of Avalokiteshvara, is associated with healing."
Tea_Bowl_with_Hare’s-Fur_Decoration,The brown and black hues of tea bowls such as this were considered among the best colors for enhancing the chartreuse color of tea that had been whisked into white foam. Wares produced at the Jian kilns in Fujian Province were used exclusively for the drinking of tea.
Bowl,"Although refined white clay with a high percentage of the silicate mineral kaolin(the primary element in porcelain) had been known in China since the Bronze Age, its use did not become widespread until after the late sixth century, when porcelain was first used to make goods for daily life and to be placed in tombs."
Stele_with_the_Bodhisattvas_Avalokiteshvara_(Guanyin)_and_Mahasthamaprapta_(Dashizi),"The two bodhisattvas seen here can be identified by the symbols on their headdresses: the figure on the right is Avalokiteshvara (as indicated by the presence of a small Buddha), and the figure on the left, wearing the symbol of a vase, is Mahasthamaprapta. The latter bodhisattva, who represents wisdom, is not found as an independent icon in Buddhist texts and art. Instead, he is usually part of a triad that includes both Avalokiteshvara and the Buddha Amitabha, who is one of the three Buddhas represented on the reverse of this stele; it seems likely that the two bodhisattvas were meant to serve as their attendants"
Lion,"This regal lion, who steps on lotus blossoms atop an altar table, may have served as the mount for a figure of the bodhisattva Manjushri, the Buddhist embodiment of transcendent wisdom."
Lobed_cooking_cauldron_(Li_),The tri-lobed shape and combed ridges of this cooking pot increased heating efficiency by maximizing the vessel’s surface area.
Seated_lion,This noble lion may have been one of a pair flanking a Buddhist deity.
Guardian_Lion,"One of a pair, this fierce guardian lion bares his fangs, crouches, and grips the platform underneath him with splayed claws. Pairs of stone lions have been found protecting Han-dynasty tombs (206 B.C.–220 A.D.) and they became more prevalent following the inclusion of lion iconography in Buddhist cave temples in northern China during the fifth and sixth centuries. Excavations of Northern Qi tombs have unearthed pairs of protective lions defending the entrance to the innermost chamber containing the coffin.This guardian lion's fully modeled body and rippling muscles is illustrative of Northern Qi sculpture, which was more rounded and naturalistic than the elongated and linear forms of the preceding Northern Wei (386–534) and Eastern Wei (534–550) dynasties. The stylized whorl pattern along the lion's shoulders is common on carvings in relief as well as sculptures in the round from this period. While the Northern Qi dynasty was brief and was supplanted by the Northern Zhou in 577, its sculptural achievements provided direction and inspiration for stone sculpture in the succeeding centuries when China was unified first under the Sui dynasty (581–618) and then under the Tang dynasty (618–906)."
Ganesha,"This architectural fragment is one of a small group of early Ganesha images found around the important Silk Road trading center of Khotan in Central Asia. Meeting the worshipper’s gaze with expressive human eyes, it is clear this is no mere elephant, but a god.The presence of a Hindu deity in a mostly Buddhist kingdom reveals how the religion spread along trade routes. For travelers traversing the long and arduous Silk Road, how appropriate to pay homage to this remover of obstacles and bringer of wealth and abundance."
Bowl_with_Two_Boys_among_Foliage,"Although early Yaozhou wares often had elegant light blue glazes, by the mid-tenth century most wares of this type were covered with olive-toned glazes. The reasons for the change remain obscure, though it may have resulted from the switch from wood to coal as the fuel for the kiln."
Vase,"Before the flowering of blue-and-white ware at this site in the fourteenth century, the kilns at Jingdezhen were producing thin porcelain covered with a pale bluish green glaze that is known as Qingbai ware (literally green-white ware). This vase is a rare example of early Qingbai pieces in which the glaze is very thin and very pale. In later pieces, the Qingbai glaze is the pale blue-green that is most commonly associated with the term celadon today."
Bowl_with_Stylized_Leaves,"Made for export, bowls with this type of decoration are often catalogued as kinrande ware after a Japanese term for fabric with gold thread. Although, as the term implies, such wares are thought to have been made primarily for Japan, examples also reached the Middle East and Europe."
Head_of_an_attendant_bodhisattva,"Both the Eastern Wei (535–50) and the Northern Qi dynasties were ruled from a capital at Ye (presentday Linzhang) in southern Hebei province; both sponsored the construction of new cave temples. The complex built at Xiangtangshan (not far from the capital) dates from the Northern Qi period. It consists of two sites: the three enormous cave temples at the top of the mountain are known as Northern Xiangtangshan, while an additional seven smaller shrines, about nine miles to the south, are known as Southern Xiangtangshan. This head comes from the southern site, which was constructed slightly later."
Pilgrim_Sudhana_(Shancai_tongzi),"Sculptures of a standing boy holding his hands in a reverent gesture often represent Sudhana, a young pilgrim who traveled throughout South and Southeast Asia to study with learned masters and celestial bodhisattvas in his quest for enlightenment. In China, he is often shown venerating the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, whom he visited during his journeys."
Emperor_Xiaowen_and_his_entourage_worshipping_the_Buddha,"Together with a companion piece showing an empress and her attendants (now in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City), this depiction of an emperor and his entourage once adorned the Central Binyang Cave (also known as Cave 3) in the Longmen complex, near Luoyang, in Henan province. It was positioned centrally on the northeast wall between a group of protective semidivinities above and a narrative debate scene below. Xuanwu commissioned the construction of the Central Binyang Cave in honor of his father, the emperor Xiaowen (r. 471–99), and his mother, the dowager Wenzhou (d. 494); the emperor and empress in the reliefs are therefore believed to refer to his parents. A figure wearing court garments and holding a tasseled baton leads the procession. He is followed by a smaller figure wearing armor and another who stands before the emperor, holding an incense burner. The trees originally indicated the point at which the procession moved around a corner, from the north to the east wall. Several of the attendants hold lotuses or other flowers and offerings, and the entire procession can be understood as making offerings to the Buddhas in the cave, an act of merit making that would continue in perpetuity and improve the future lives of the participants."
Attendant_Bodhisattva,"This sculpture of an attendant bodhisattva was most likely part of a colossal triptych showing a Buddha flanked by two such figures. It is made of willow, a material that was often used in the north for the construction of Buddhist sculpture, and was once brightly painted. The body’s sense of volume, the careful rendering of the braids that fall along the shoulders, and the scarf tied at the chest are typical features of Buddhist statuary dating from the tenth and eleventh centuries."
Jug_with_Floral_Scroll,The shape of this tankard is derived from Islamic metalwork: it seems likely that the piece was produced for export.
Attendant_Bodhisattva,The figure's posture suggests that this sculpture represents a bodhisattva who served as an attendant to a Buddha or some other transcendent figure. It was most likely part of a larger group of figures depicting various members of the Buddhist pantheon.
Sadaksari-Lokeshvara_Surrounded_by_Manifestations_and_Monks,"This painting represents the “six-syllables form” of Avalokiteshvara, evoking the mantra om mani padme hum. As expounded by the fourteenth Dalai Lama, om denotes the impurities that impede spiritual awareness; mani (jewel) symbolizes the pathway lit by compassion; padme (lotus) defines the tool, wisdom; and hum the indivisible union of wisdom and method—so achieving the purity of body, speech, and mind of Buddhahood. This fundamental teaching is given expression in the purity of this representation of the highest embodiment of compassion. The Dalai Lama is understood to be an incarnation of this form of Avalokiteshvara. Conventionally represented in white, Sadaksari-Lokeshvara is gold here, the most radiant of colors. Surrounding him are bodhisattvas, an array of protectors, and a lineage of monks."
Demon_queller_Zhong_Kui_with_demons,"The tale of Zhong Kui quelling demons can be traced to the Tang dynasty (618–907) when Emperor Minghuang (r. 712–756) was purportedly cured of an illness after dreaming about a large ghost eating demons. Here, complicated groups of figures are carefully carved into the natural shape of the bamboo. Zhong Kui is shown seated on the back of a recumbent demon, while other demons present him various offerings."
Vase_from_a_five-piece_altar_set,"Cloisonné is the technique of creating designs on metal vessels with colored glass paste placed within enclosures made of copper or bronze wires, which have been bent or hammered into the desired patterns. Known as cloisons (French for ""partitions""), the enclosures are generally either glued or soldered onto the metal body. The glass paste, or enamel—which gets its color from metallic oxides—is painted into the contained areas of the design. The vessel is usually fired at a relatively low temperature, about 800 degrees Celsius. Enamels tend to shrink during firing, and the process is repeated several times to fill in the design. Once this process is completed, the surface of the vessel is rubbed until the edges of the cloisons are visible."
Rectangular_tray_with_peonies_and_birds,"The plump birds flying above the peonies on this densely carved tray may be magpies or sparrows, both of which are considered good omens in Chinese culture."
Dish,"The basic form of the bowl, with a thin body, is derived from a Dutch press-metalwork prototype. The foliate rim, however, is a Chinese modification. The division of the decoration into discrete fields, delineated by linear and ogival frames, is a manner the Chinese potter adopted for certain types of export ware. The motifs, including the central one of the eagle and the rising sun, are commonly seen in Chinese decorative arts of the period."
An_Introduction_to_Square_Word_Calligraphy,"In the early 1990s, Xu began to develop a system for writing English called “square word calligraphy,” which organizes the letters of each English word into structures that resemble Chinese characters. One consequence of his project is that non-Chinese speakers can understand how Chinese characters are similarly composed of discrete phonetic and lexigraphic components. An Introduction to Square Word Calligraphy expands on the didactic potential of the new script by offering directions for how to prepare ink, hold a brush, and execute individual brushstrokes. In the process of deciphering Xu’s text, viewers break down cultural barriers. Square word calligraphy helps demystify the Chinese written language, making the pleasures of calligraphy available to a wider audience."
Foliated_dish_with_floral_scrolls,"This lovely scalloped dish depicts stylized lotus scrolls set in a swirling circular rhythmic pattern. Such design is classic among early Ming imperial works, including ceramics, lacquer ware, and textiles. The surfaces of early cloisonné works like this dish often feature vivid colors (red, yellow, lapis blue, white, and green), set against a turquoise blue background."
Dish_with_European_Man_and_Child,"The European interest in and reworking of Chinese designs and themes in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is often known by the French term chinoiserie, which can be translated as ""Chinese-like."" While there is no such term for the reverse trend of Chinese interest in European art, figures such as the man and boy on this dish attest to the knowledge in China of European imagery, possibly inspired by prints."
Mold_for_a_Bowl,"Molds such as this one were widely used in ceramic production in north China, particularly after the eleventh century, and are thought to have become common in an attempt to meet the growing demands for ceramic of various types at the time. As can be seen in the model bowl made using this mold, the clay was fitted over the mold in order to impress a design prior to covering the bowl with clay and firing it. Use of molds allowed for faster production than the hand-shaped and hand-carved decoration used earlier."
Tray,"The shape of this tray emulates silver examples imported from either the Sasanian empire (224–651) in present-day Iran or the trading nation of Sogdia in present-day Uzbekistan. The pattern at the center of the tray was impressed while the clay was still soft, then splashed with three colors (sancai) of glaze that first appeared in funerary ceramics of the late seventh century. The addition of blue to the standard beige, green, and amber palette dates this tray to the eighth century when that color was first used."
Plate_with_Geese_in_a_Lotus_Pond,"Popularly known as kraak ware, ceramics such as this were produced in large numbers for trade, particularly with Europe. They are thought to have been named after the word carrack (a transmutation of an Arabic term), which was used to describe large sailing vessels."
Dish,"The cracks on this dish, made to resemble the accidental cracks that sometimes occurred during the firing of ceramics, are deliberate. The piece is an example of ceramics produced in south China near the Southern Song capital of Hangzhou to re-create imperial wares produced earlier in the north: delicate cracks, sometimes known as crazing, are one of the hallmarks of the famed, and rare, Ru ware produced for the Northern Song court."
Bowl,"Kilns producing Jun ware, which were based in north China, are listed among the kilns that made wares for the court during the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127). The light blue color of the glaze on this elegant bowl typifies some of the finest Jun wares produced during this period."
Buddha_Shakyamuni_with_attendant_bodhisattvas,"This extraordinary group is a rare example of Buddhist sculpture made in China using mammoth ivory as opposed to elephant ivory. Based on a text known as the Flower Garland Sutra, it depicts the founder of Buddhism, Shakyamuni, seated on a mythical animal known as a qilin and attended by the bodhisattvas Samantabhadhra (Chinese: Puxian) on an elephant and Manjushri (Chinese: Wenshu) on a lion. The former symbolizes virtuous practice, the later wisdom."
Dish_with_long-tailed_birds_and_hibiscuses,"Several features help date this remarkable dish to the fourteenth century. Two birds circle one another playfully in a composition suited to the circular shape. The lush hollyhock blossoms, shown from multiple perspectives, have petals of different sizes that overlap to suggest depth. Long, narrow leaves fill at least three layers of carving, adding to the richness of the surface. The unworked dark background seen here is more commonly found in earlier carved lacquers."
Vase_with_Coiling_Dragon,The awe which Chinese ceramics inspired in the West is reflected in the use of an elaborate mount to restore the original shape of this vase.
Mirror_with_game_board_design_and_animals_of_the_four_directions,"On the back of this mirror, a diagrammatic decoration points to a new cosmology. The square world—aligned with the four cardinal directions and inscribed with the “twelve earthly branches” used to compute the calendar—is surrounded by the circular heavens, in turn ringed by the waves of the cosmic ocean. Animals of the four directions (the green dragon of the east, white tiger of the west, red bird of the south, and entwined black turtle and snake of the north) and other mythical creatures share the heavens with T-, L-, and V-shaped markings. These recall the measuring devices and rulers used by Fu Xi and Nu Wa, who were believed to have created the universe."
Snuff_bottle_with_European_figures,"This snuff bottle illustrates the frequent contact between China and the West during the Qing dynasty, a time when not only the technique (painted enamel) but also the decorative motifs (Western figures in a landscape setting) were introduced from Europe."
"Compassionate_and_Merciful_Avalokiteshvara,_Savior_from_Perils","This composite work consists of nine identical images of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin in Chinese), all impressed with the same woodblock. The iconographic attributes of the deity are fully represented."
Polestar_Deity_Kui_Xing,"The Pole Star, a popular religious figure associated with the Lord of Literature (Wen Chang Dijun), was the tutelary spirit presiding over the civil-service examinations. Depicted as a demonic figure (the name of the star is a homophone for the word for ""eminent,"" which is composed of the ideograph for ""demon"" and the ideograph for ""dipper""), the Pole Star had a cult that became particularly important in Ming times, when the number of examination candidates competing for the limited number of available official appointments made divine help all the more welcome.This dynamic figure shows the god in the act of adding the final dot to the Big Dipper constellation over which he presides. The deity, his robes swept backward by a cosmic wind, balanced on one foot (now missing) while holding aloft a brush (also missing). In his left hand he grasps an ingot of gold or silver, symbolic of the emoluments forth-coming from examination success."
Vase_with_Immortals_Offering_the_Peaches_of_Longevity,"A group of men and their attendants burn incense in an open pavilion. Their activities have attracted the attention of the supernatural: a peacock-like phoenix of enormous size has landed, while in the clouds, Xiwangmu (the queen mother of the west) and her entourage have arrived. An attendant proffers a bowl containing peaches of immortality picked from Xiwangmu's orchard. Immortal beings, including Shoulao (the god of longevity), are depicted on the neck of the vase.Works such as this, with scenes of immortals and themes of immortality, were especially appropriate for display at birthday receptions."
Wine_container_(Hu),"As the Shang animal mask lost its symbolic meaning under the Zhou, it dissolved into an ornamental pattern, as here, where an “eye” is encircled by curving hooked lines."
Altar_bowl_with_Tibetan_inscription,"This type of vessel was used as a ceremonial tea bowl with a metal or lacquer saucer. The Tibetan inscription around its body offers auspicious wishes to the user. The same inscription was incised into the bowl’s interior, an investment of craftsmanship that speaks to the exceptional quality of the piece."
Bowl_with_deer,"The main motif of this bowl, a deer with a single crown-shaped antler, is inspired by the Sogdian art of Central Asia. It is formed in repoussé then gilded—a typical technique found in Sassanian silverwork, as is the chased decoration along the vessel lip."
Bowl,"Silver articles of the early Tang period (618– 907) display complex forms and minutely detailed decoration. In this bowl, the vessel walls are decorated in repoussé."
Monk_Sengqie,"This sculpture is a rare representation of Sengqie (ca. 660–710), a monk from central Asia who founded a temple in Sizhou (modern Liuhuai, Anhui Province), on the south shore of the Huai River. Popularly known as the Monk of Sizhou, he was venerated after his death as an incarnation of Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. During the Song dynasty, he became a cult figure revered for his power to prevent floods."
Panel_with_“hundred_antiques”,"The “hundred antiques” pattern became popular in China in the seventeenth century. It often features antiques, ornamental vessels, and scholar’s accessories in various media, resulting in a colorful, playful surface. Here, spinach jade represents an ancient bronze tripod with green patina, while cloisonné mimics both an archaic bronze pattern on the left and a contemporary porcelain pattern on the right."
Censer,This spherical censer was originally suspended from a chain. The interior hemispherical bowl for incense is hung on gimbals so that it remains upright as the censer is swung.
Seal_with_Knob_in_the_Shape_of_a_Turtle,"So-called “seal script,” seen here, is an archaic writing style that was standardized during the Qin (221–206 B.C.) and Han dynasties (206 B.C.–A.D. 220). It is characterized by straight lines of uniform width and angular turns suited to a square format. The inscription reads:“Seal of Tiannan General”"
Vase_with_the_Pole_Star_deity_(Kui_Xing),"Featured on this cylindrical vase is the Kui Star, a popular deity associated with the Lord of Literature, standing on the head of a fish that is turning into a dragon. The fish, a carp, symbolizes a scholar trying to pass the civil-service examinations to earn an official appointment. It changes into a dragon after leaping through the Dragon Gate, just as a scholar is transformed after passing the examinations. The Kui Star, who oversees the conferring of degrees, is depicted riding through the waves with a writing brush in his right hand and a bushel in his left."
Vessel_in_the_Shape_of_a_Tiger_(Huzi),"In southern China, especially in the coastal provinces of the southeast, pottery with a lime glaze was fired at the high temperature (above 1000 degrees centigrade). The yellowish green color is due to the presence of iron."
Grain_Serving_Vessel_(Dui),"This vessel’s deeply reserved ornamentation was meant to be filled with colored inlay. The lid, when inverted, functions as a serving dish."
Couch_Table,"This low table is a convenient height for teacups or reading material. Placed along the central axis of the couch, it creates an agreeable distance between two sitters."
Basin,"On the walls of this large basin, five spirited dragons—their sinuous bodies carved in high relief—chase two flaming pearls in and out of swirling clouds. A poem by Emperor Qianlong inscribed on the interior floor dates the jade to 1774 and points to Khotan in far northwestern China as the source of this huge boulder. The overall shape and decoration suggest that the basin was inspired by the colossal jade wine container that Khubilai Khan (1215–1294) commissioned in 1265."
Rectangular_cauldron_(Fangding),The most common decorative motif on Shang and early Western Zhou ritual bronzes is a stylized animal “mask” (taotie) with bulging eyes and curved horns. These masks are typically composed of two confronted profiles of the same animal.
Double_bottle_(one_of_a_pair),"The double bottle form of this pair of flasks exemplifies a playful new design that appeared in the eighteenth century. Animals depicted on both sides deliver auspicious wishes: dragons and tigers are signs of vigorous power, while horses, monkeys, and a seal hung on a tree represent a visual pun for “bestowing an official title immediately.”"
Double_bottle_(one_of_a_pair),"The double bottle form of this pair of flasks exemplifies a playful new design that appeared in the eighteenth century. Animals depicted on both sides deliver auspicious wishes: dragons and tigers are signs of vigorous power, while horses, monkeys, and a seal hung on a tree represent a visual pun for “bestowing an official title immediately.”"
Tiered_box,"In the sixteenth century, there was a general decline in the quality of official wares in all media, including cloisonné. The enamels tend to be duller in color and the patterns appear to be less refined in comparison to the works from the previous century. In the last century of effective Ming-dynasty rule, official workshops were beginning to be run more like commercial enterprises with attention centered on productivity and efficiency."
Seated_luohan_(arhat)_in_a_grotto,This superb sculpture of lapis lazuli depicts a Buddhist sage meditating in a rocky cave under a craggy tree. The master carver demonstrated his formidable skill by managing to turn the large light gray blotches of the stone into the gnarled tree trunk and the whitish spots into the highlights on the monk’s face.
Woman's_Sleeveless_Jacket,"The small repeating roundels on this sleeveless jacket are a form of the Chinese character shou, signifying longevity. Each of the shou characters includes two wan characters (swastikas), signifying ten thousand years. The garment was appropriately worn for birthday celebrations."
Incense_box_with_fragrant_grass_design,"The scrolling design that fills the surface of this box is often called the “fragrant grass” motif in Chinese writings on lacquer. It is closely linked to another pattern featuring abstract scrolls that is popularly known as the “pommel scroll.” Both designs, ubiquitous in carved lacquer, can be traced to abstract patterns in early Chinese lacquers and bronze vessels. The reemergence of this motif during the Song period (960–1279) reflects the fascination with antiquarian imagery that marked this period of Chinese history and the rediscovery of that time of earlier artistic traditions."
Jacket_and_Skirt_for_Wedding,"The principle of yin and yang was central to the clothing worn by bride and groom at a Chinese wedding. This jacket and skirt were appropriate dress for a Chinese bride, who, as a female (yin), wore an even number of garments, while her groom (yang) wore an odd number. Unlike Western bridal gowns, Chinese wedding ensembles were usually meant to be worn again for important celebrations, such as significant birthdays. The most typical pattern for bridal wear was the phoenix, but this ensemble features ears of grain with auspicious cranes, symbolic of longevity, both sumptuously embroidered in heavy gold threads."
"Mirror_Case_with_Pattern_of_Rock,_Chrysanthemums,_and_Pomegranates","Glass was not much used before the twentieth century in making Chinese mirrors; instead, a highly polished metal surface provided the reflection. When not in use, a mirror could be stored in a case like this."
Snuff_bottle_with_eight_Buddhist_treasures,"In the mid-eighteenth century, Chinese potters developed sophisticated skills in imitating other materials in ceramic. This snuff bottle is an example that successfully mimics carved red lacquer in porcelain."
God_of_Longevity_(Shoulao),"The prominent cranium identifies this figure as Shoulao, the God of Longevity. Here, he holds a peach, a symbol of long life, and his jacket is decorated with the Chinese character for longevity (shou)."
"Shakyamuni_with_luohan,_heavenly_king,_and_boys","Young boys are a common auspicious motif in Chinese painting and decorative arts. Here, a group of four boys playfully deliver offerings to Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha, who is attended by a luohan and a heavenly king, a martial figure who guards one of the cardinal directions."
Bottle_with_lotuses,"Fahua ceramics share technical parallels with cloisonné enamels, as both media feature enclosures filled in with a colored glaze or enamel. Known as alkaline, the glazes used on fahua wares form a separate group, marked by a higher potassium-to-lead ratio. In this mixture, copper oxide creates the bright turquoise color that is also ubiquitous in cloisonné."
Bottle_with_Daoist_Immortals,"The immortals on the bottle are all carrying the Chinese character shou, or longevity, and the good wishes implied therein are also reiterated in the inscription on the neck, which reiterates the desire for long life."
Panel_with_Shou_Characters_and_Lingzhi_Fungus,"In this textile, the Chinese character for longevity (shou) is paired with lingzhi, a type of fungus said to impart long life. Both the shou characters and the outlines of the lingzhi are woven in metallic thread."
Plate_with_cartouches_of_women_and_plants,"Elegant women are a popular subject in Chinese decorative arts. Often they are shown accompanying children, engaging in leisure activities such as playing music and visiting gardens, or, as on this plate, enjoying flowers."
Seated_Dipankara_Buddha_with_Flaming_Shoulders,In a past birth Shakyamuni met the Buddha Dipankara and vowed to pursue the path to Buddhahood. By the fourth century Dipankara Buddhas represented with flaming shoulders began to appear in the sculpture of Gandhara and Afghanistan and in Chinese bronzes. This seated Buddha was likely part of a mandorla.
Wine_beaker_(gu),A single character (clan sign) is cast inside the foot of the vessel.
Bowl,"The tradition of copper-red glazes, used in endless variations in world ceramic history, ultimately derives from Chinese pieces such as this one, in which copper was used to create a dramatic purple splash on a blue glaze."
Arhat,"This figure is an arhat (luohan), a protector of the Buddhist faith and an exemplar for practitioners. Buddhist imagery plays an important role in Chinese decorative arts, and arhats are a popular subject."
"Saddle,_Saddle_Pad,_Stirrups,_Rein,_Stirrup_Straps,_Bit_and_Bridle,_Breaststrap,_Tassel,_and_Crupper","The central decorative feature of this intricate eighteenth- or nineteenth-centry Sino-Tibetan saddle is thekīrttimukha, or Face of Glory, a glowering mask that recurs in various forms throughout the religious ornament of Tibet, China, India, and Indonesia. According to one story, thekīrttimukhawas a lion-headed demon created by the supreme Hindu deity, Shiva, and served both as his doorkeeper and as a manifestation of his divine power. Thekīrttimukhamotif spread with the expansion of Hinduism and, like many other aspects of Hindu belief and art, was eventually incorporated into the Buddhist tradition and widely disseminated by it. In both religions it symbolizes the beneficence of dinive authority and protection from spiritual and physical dangers. Thekīrttimukhawas used ubiquitously as an auspicious sign to ward off evil.On the saddle thekīrttimukhaappears in the center of the large gilt-copper plaques mounted on the front and back, and also in the center of the uppermost pierced and chiseled iron border. It is surrounded by a rich array of equally meaningful sacred attributes, including, on the upper border, the triratna, or the Three Jewels. This symbol represents the triple foundation shared by all Buddhist sects: Buddha, the Enlightened One; dharma, his teachings; and sangha, the community of believers. Flanking the Three Jewels is the image of a dragon holding a pearl, a popular motif with roots in Taoist China. In Buddhism the pearl or single jewel stands for faultless purity and, therefor, the infallible truth of the religion's doctrine. The dragon acts as the jewel's heavenly guardian.In the center of the lower pierced border is thecintāma?i, or Wish-Granting Jewel, another example of the jewel motif frequently encountered in Buddhist art. It typically appears either as a cluster of elongated orbs or as a single tear-shaped sphere surrounded by an aureole of flames. Thecintāma?iis an augury of material prosperity and a symbol of the fulfillment of all wishes through the Buddha. The related concept of salvation attained through the teachings of the Buddha is represented by the pair of diminutive deer that flank thecintāma?iand refer to the Deer Park at Sarnath, near Benares, in northeastern India, where Siddhārtha Gautama was said to have preached his first sermon.The pierced borders of this saddle are reminiscent of Chinese metalwork but the embossed plaques call to mind the workmanship of eastern Tibet, suggesting perhaps that the saddle is composed of elements from both countries. The highly concentrated use of complementary religious symbols on a luxurious objects of this kind, however, was not unusual in the decorative arts of either imperial China or theocratic Tibet. The images can be appreciated individually, in the full depth of their meaning, or for their overall effect, simply as a compilation of talismanic ornament."
Ewer_in_Shape_of_Tibetan_Monk’s_Cap,This shape was introduced to the repertory of Chinese ceramics in the fourteenth century due in part to the prominence of Tibetan monks and practices at the Mongol Yuan (1271–1368) court.
Bodhisattva_Avalokiteshvara_in_Water_Moon_Form_(Shuiyue_Guanyin),"This powerful figure belongs to a small group of wooden sculptures that can be securely dated, owing to an inscription that also provides rare information regarding its production and intended use. The inscription appears on the interior surface of a removable panel in the figure’s back that gives access to a chamber that once contained consecratory material. It states that the sculpture was carved in 1385 under the direction of a certain Xin Zhongwen, who, together with members of Dongan village, commissioned the piece. It also names two artists—Feng Xiaozhong, “Woodcarver-in-Attendance,” and his son—and explains that the sculpture was created for a temple and to serve as a guardian of a road."
Box_with_a_scholar_and_chrysanthemums,"Diminutive figures set in a towering landscape became a traditional motif in Chinese art. Here, a scholar-gentleman supervises two attendants carrying chrysanthemums, a plant whose late autumn bloom was thought to symbolize a gentleman’s lofty character."
Altar_Set,"This elaborate set of ritual bronzes, consisting of an altar table and thirteen wine vessels, illustrates the splendor of China’s Bronze Age at its peak. The monumental design, intricate surface decoration, and refined casting attest convincingly to artistic sophistication and tech-nological advancement. The set was reportedly found in the early twentieth century at the tomb of a Western Zhou aristocrat in Shaanxi province and subsequently entered the collection of Duan Fang, a prominent government official and renowned antiquarian, whose heirs later sold it to the Metropolitan Museum."
Writing_brush_with_geometric_patterns,"This brush handle shows all of the characteristics of early Chinese carved lacquer: the geometric design is not standardized, as it would be in a later piece, and the lacquer clearly shows alternating layers of black and red."
Length_of_Woven_Silk,"A small number of Chinese textiles were based on European “bizarre” silk designs. This example combines a sophisticated mélange of lush flora and fantastic architectural features—elements that periodically appeared in European silks from about 1695 to 1720. The gilt-paper-wrapped thread woven into the fabric is uniquely Chinese, but the cloth’s narrow loom width is the same as that of many eighteenth-century European dress silks. This is surprising because most Chinese export silks were woven on wider looms. Perhaps such silks, masquerading as European products, were made to circumvent the English and French bans on imported Asian silks enacted at the turn of the eighteenth century."
Double-sided_Hanging,"The design of the vibrant flowers on this Chinese hanging marks it as an export for Europe. Unlike typical Chinese flowers, their centers dramatically protrude and contrast sharply with the petals, signaling the influence of Indian export textiles with similar floral forms. However, the container of flowers rests on a distinctly Chinese garden rock, stitched in blue and white. Immaculately finished on both sides, the contrasting yellow selvages visible on the red side mark the yellow as the front. The hanging may have been used as a bed curtain, the red side visible to people inside the bed, while the yellow was exposed to the public eye.cat. no. 29"
Wine_cup_with_two_ducks,West Asian depictions of two birds facing one another may have helped to inspire the representation of the two mandarin ducks in the interior of this cup. In Chinese culture the ducks are a longstanding symbol for marital happiness.
One_of_a_Pair_of_Boxes_in_the_Shape_of_Ducks,"Ducks, particularly in pairs, function as symbols of marital bliss in Chinese art, and it seems likely that this charming pair was once either a wedding gift or part of a dowry."
Youthful_Manjushri_on_a_Lotus_Throne,"This work was likely produced for Chinese use. This unusual representation of Manjushri shows him as a child, with a plump face and the five topknots of childhood, known in China as wuji wenshu. A foliate necklace with settings for gemstones adorns his youthful figure."
Pomegranates,"As the Chinese character for “seed” (zi) is the same as that for “son,” the many-seeded pomegranate is viewed as a symbol for having multiple sons who are expected to continue the family line. The use of puns and rebuses to express wishes for good fortune, longevity, prosperity, and even academic success has been a common theme in Chinese art."
Burner_(Ran_Lu),"Small burners, known as ran lu in Chinese, are used for heating dipping sauce for meat. It is generally coupled with a small saucer, often in the shape of an eared cup (er bei), which is missing here."
One_of_a_Pair_of_Boxes_in_the_Shape_of_Ducks,"Ducks, particularly in pairs, function as symbols of marital bliss in Chinese art, and it seems likely that this charming pair was once either a wedding gift or part of a dowry."
Theatrical_Robe_for_a_Military_Role,"This impressive robe was designed as light military attire for Chinese opera. The white color was often intended for a young general. The powerful, vibrant dragons on this robe help date it to the early eighteenth century."
God_of_Longevity_(Shoulao)_with_children,"The God of Longevity (Shoulao), shown here accompanied by children, is one of the three most popular deities in Chinese folklore. The other two are gods of good fortune and achievement and distinction.Abundant in nature and desirable for carving, bamboo is frequently used both as a material and a subject matter in Chinese art from this period. Its resilience is often compared to the virtue of those who maintain their principles in the face of adversity, and its hollow stalk is often associated with humility and an unprejudiced mind."
Incense_Box,"This box exemplifies a sophisticated type of Chinese carved lacquer known as tixi, a term referring to the marbled appearance of its layers. The elegant design and skillful carving distinguish the box as the work of a master, and the signature of the fourteenth-century master Yang Mao is incised on the underside. Moore’s small but carefully selected collection of Chinese lacquer reflects the designer’s refined taste for the art form."
Vertical_pendant_with_boys_holding_a_lotus_scroll,"Remarkable for its large size and fresh colors, this textile was woven with the typical Chinese motif of boys and lotuses. However, details on certain costumes reveal a Mongolian influence. The jackets of the boys seen at top and bottom are fastened on the figures’ left, a style not used in Chinese clothing. The design of the large flower blossom and the color palette also help to date it to the Yuan period, when China was under Mongol rule."
Vase_with_Elephant_Handles,"By the tenth century the Chinese had mastered the techniques necessary to manipulate glazes, a knowledge that was refined further in the eighteenth century with the development of new colors and effects. Many of these glazes have poetic names in Chinese, French (due to early French record-keeping of the porcelain industry), and, at times, English translation. The ""tea-dust"" glaze on this vase can be traced to green celadon glazes and recalls the patina of ancient bronzes."
Box_with_scene_of_a_zither_(qin)_gathering,"On the cover of this box, a pair of seated men relax on a veranda that overlooks a body of water. One plays the Chinese zither (qin) while the other listens. A trio of attendants, one inside the nearby pavilion, also enjoy the music. Scenes depicting the cultured lifestyle and artistic skills of the scholarly class became ubiquitous in Chinese painting and decorative arts after the fourteenth century."
Textile_with_Aquatic_Birds_and_Recumbent_Animal,"The free arrangement of animals on a rhythmic background of geometric leafs is typical of Eastern Central Asian textiles of the eleventh to the thirteenth century. The design is also seen on Chinese tapestries of the period. A similar example was excavated from the burial pagoda of a Buddhist monk, Haiyun (1203–1257), in Beijing, attesting to the strong ties between Chinese and Central Asian textiles at the time."
One_of_a_pair_of_boxes_with_elephants,"Marks on the inside and bottom of these boxes indicate that they were produced in the imperial workshop and titled “Peaceful Boxes of Treasure” (shengping baohe). Each cover is decorated with two attendants and a caparisoned elephant bearing a basin of treasures. The facial features of the attendants indicate that they are non-Chinese people. This scene envisions the traditional Chinese fantasy of foreign countries bringing treasures to pay tribute in times of peace. As an exotic and auspicious animal, the elephant is always featured in this visual pun."
House_with_Courtyard,Pottery models of houses and farm structures were commonly included in Eastern Han burials to provide for the afterlife.
Guanyin_and_the_sixteen_luohans,"Chinese beliefs about magical islands and enchanted caves were blended with Buddhist ideas imported from India to create iconographic combinations like the one you see here. Mystical clouds encircle the magical island of Mount Putuo as a dragon rises from the crashing waves. The bodhisattva Guanyin, who pledged to forgo enlightenment and remain in the world in order to aid suffering beings, sits in a cave high atop the mountain. Sixteen luohans, wizened guardians of the Buddhist law, pay her homage. Prostrating before Guanyin is the young pilgrim boy Sudhana (Chinese: Shancai), who has come to her seeking spiritual guidance."
Jar_with_floral_scrolls_and_wrapped-cloth_design_(one_of_a_pair),"In the early decades of the eighteenth century, artists developed a new palette of opaque enamels that could produce novel decorative effects. In this example, the design mimics the appearance of a vessel with a fine textile tied around it, alluding to the East Asian practice of wrapping gifts in textiles. Wrapped-cloth (baofu) designs were also found on lacquer objects of the period."
One_of_a_pair_of_boxes_with_elephants,"Marks on the inside and bottom of these boxes indicate that they were produced in the imperial workshop and titled “Peaceful Boxes of Treasure” (shengping baohe). Each cover is decorated with two attendants and a caparisoned elephant bearing a basin of treasures. The facial features of the attendants indicate that they are non-Chinese people. This scene envisions the traditional Chinese fantasy of foreign countries bringing treasures to pay tribute in times of peace. As an exotic and auspicious animal, the elephant is always featured in this visual pun."
Panel_with_gourds_on_vines,"As the word for gourd is a homophone of “fortune and prosperity” in Chinese, the fruit became a popular motif in eighteenth-century art. Here, meticulously woven silk threads represent ten gourds growing out of lush vines. The large gourd at center is imbued with additional auspicious meaning. Over a geometric-patterned background, the artist added two Chinese characters that read “grand luck” (da ji) and images of the Eight Buddhist Treasures."
Vajrabhairava_mandala,"In the fourteenth century, China was ruled by the Mongol Yuan dynasty, established by Khubilai Khan (1215–1294), grandson of Genghis Khan (1162–1227). The Mongol rulers were adherents of Tibetan Buddhism, and they were also lavish patrons of luxury arts, including sumptuous woven silk textiles. This is an example of the fanciest type of textile, kesi, in which each colored thread is woven individually to form an image. The central focal point is the fierce deity Vajrabhairava, the buffalo-headed, blue-skinned conqueror of death, a focus of devotion for the Yuan emperors. At the bottom are portraits of the patrons, from left to right: Tugh Temür, the great-grandson of Khubilai Khan, who briefly served as emperor of the Yuan dynasty, his older brother, and their wives."
Flask_with_Medallion,Both the shape of the flask and the stylized medallion painted on the front and back derive from Islamic traditions and reflect the strong ties between China and West Asian centers in the early fifteenth century.
Landscape_with_hermits_and_a_crane,"This sculpture exploits the otherworldly luminescence of jade to depict a landscape beyond the reach of mere mortals. In the foreground, by a rushing river, an aging scholar communes with a crane, the frequent companion of Daoists and hermit"
Vase_with_historical_warriors,"The figures on this vase were inspired by illustrations of historical characters in woodblock-printed plays and novels. Those publications became popular in the seventeenth century and influenced porcelain design and other decorative arts.On view during Rotation 1 of exhibition from June 25, 2016 through January 13, 2017."
Basin_with_scene_of_Daoist_immortals,"On this large six-lobed basin, an immortal and his attendants float on multicolored clouds above a misty island temple. Dressed in yellow, the central figure is playing pitch-pot (touhu) by throwing arrows into a vase on the terrace below. The colorful and complex composition and the use of clouds warp the viewer’s sense of perspective and create an otherworldly feel befitting the Daoist subject."
Wall_panel_with_stone_paintings,"Inscribed, on the round slab: “Autumn Mountains in Mist and Cloud. In the distance it looks like mist and cloud; as you get near you see that it is the void. From a Tang poem, [signed] Zhushan”; on the rectangular slab: “A Magical Tower after Snow. The snow-covered cliff in the sunset looks like a jade screen. From a Tang poem, [signed] Yibai.”Inscribed, on the round slab: “Morning Mist in a Spring Forest, inscribed by Zhushan jushi”; on the rectangular slab: “Overhanging Cliff and Sheer Wall. Inscribed by Yibai shanren at Shenjiang (the Huangpu River in Shanghai).”"
Vase_with_the_“One_Hundred_Deer”_motif,"Deer were considered supernatural creatures in premodern China. Here, the animals cavort in a magical forest of towering pines. Thanks to the newly introduced enamel painting method, both the deer and the landscape are rendered with a rich variety of color and subtle changes in tone. This imposing vase carries a second layer of meaning as the Chinee word for deer (lu) is a homonym for “bureaucratic benefits.” One hundred deer signify the numerous social and economic benefits a man could accrue during his career"
Buddha_Maitreya_(Mile)_Altarpiece,"This complex assembly depicts the Buddha of the Future, Maitreya, who descends to earth to enlighten and save devout believers. He stands in front of an openwork back panel encircled by flames and flying celestial musicians, gesturing to reassure worshipers and promising to grant their wishes. Two attendant bodhisattvas stand at his side, with another pair at his feet. Next to them are four patrons—two on each side—dressed in secular clothes and holding bowls of offerings. Thunderbolt bearers are placed as guardians at opposite front corners of the altarpiece. Below the main platform are two seated lions—protectors of the dharma, or the universal truth of Buddhism. An incised text on the base records the name of the person and date upon which he commissioned this sculpture to invoke the Buddha’s blessing for his deceased son and relatives."
Wine_container_(zun),A single character (clan sign) is cast on the interior of the vessel.
"Figure,_possibly_the_God_of_Wealth_in_His_Military_Aspect","The tentative identification of this figure with the God of Wealth is based on the hat that he wears. One of many popular gods in China, the God of Wealth (Cai Shen) is thought to derive from a historical figure who lived during the Qin dynasty (221–206 B.C.), and was later deified and revered for his ability to foster wealth and good fortune."
Double_vessel_with_mythical_beasts_(champion_vase),"The term “champion vase,” which appears only in Western scholarship, refers to vessels that have two narrow vertical compartments connected by a carved mythical bird. It may be a loose translation of yingxiong bei, or hero’s cup, referring to the eagle (ying) and the bear (xiong) upon which such vessels stand. Based on an archaic bronze vessel type that can be traced back to the second century B.C., champion vases were revived beginning in the sixteenth century and were manufactured in the following centuries in different media, including jade, cloisonné enamel, and rhinoceros horn."
Disc_with_Auspicious_Images,"Deer and cranes are ubiquitous Chinese motifs symbolic of good wishes, as is the pine tree in the center of this plaque. Similar themes are reiterated in two of the inscriptions. The inscription written on a banner suspended at the lower left is the name of an antiques shop active in Beijing in the late nineteeth and early twentieth centuries; that at the upper right records the Chinese name of E. Farago, a custom's officer who was influential at the court of the Guangxu Emperor (r. 1871–1908)."
Wrapping_cloth,"Wrapping cloth was used to bundle material for carrying and was popular in East Asia before the introduction of the modern backpack. Resist- and stencil-dyed patterns of two pairs of stylized badgers hugging each other appear on opposite corners. The Chinese word for “badger” (huan) is pronounced the same as the word for “happiness.” Two badgers, therefore, symbolize double happiness, a common pun in Chinese art."
Nine_Elders_of_Mount_Xiang,"The animated figures in this wooded mountain scene, carved on a stone boulder, represent the celebrated gathering of Bai Juyi, a renowned poet of the Tang dynasty (618–907), and his friends on the Hill of Fragrance (Xiangshan) in the eastern capital city Luoyang. Freed from their official duties, the nine retirees enjoyed nature, poetry, and other scholarly activities—a dream lifestyle for the learned elite class."
"Seated_Buddha,_probably_Shakyamuni_(Shijiamouni)","Representations of the Buddha wearing a thick shawl over both shoulders and sitting atop a throne with lions on either side are Chinese adaptations of images derived from the northwest region of the Indian subcontinent, particularly from areas in present-day Pakistan (known as Gandhara in the ancient world). Scientific examination of this sculpture has shown that it was cast using several ceramic molds, a technique that was also used to create the ancient bronze ritual vessels on view in this gallery. By the fifth century, the lost-wax method, which may have been introduced with Buddhism, was used more often for the casting of Chinese sculptures."
"Plate_with_Monkey,_Bees,_Magpie,_and_Deer","Visual puns, often made by using homophones, are a popular design language in Chinese art. In addition to being a zodiac animal, the monkey also symbolizes a noble title, because it is pronounced the same as the word for marquis (hou) in Chinese. Here, monkey, bees, magpie, and deer are combined to convey “giving great wealth and bestowing a noble title” (jue lu feng hou). This handsomely painted blue-and-white dish therefore expresses two wishes for good fortune."
Tripod_incense_burner,"With its three straight legs, deep bowl, and two handles, this porcelain echoes the ding, one of the most important forms of ancient Chinese ritual vessel. Ding were used as food and storage vessels and for ritual offerings. Like many ancient Chinese bronzes, ding were symbols of power and authority, and vessels in their shape were made in various materials and were popular with collectors."
Roof-tile_end_with_dragon,"In traditional Chinese architecture, half-cylindrical roof tiles end in a round cap that helps secure the row of tiles and also decorates the building. During the Ming and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties, the color yellow and the five-clawed dragon were reserved exclusively for imperial use."
Scroll_Cover_with_Birds_and_Flowers,"Some of the earliest preserved examples of Chinese tapestry survived as covers for paintings. This piece came into the Museum’s collection as the cover for the handscroll Dragon Boat Regatta on Jinming Lake after Wang Zhenpeng (ca. 1280–1329). Using such a precious textile in this way both highlighted the importance of the painting and enhanced viewing, as opening the cover and unrolling the enclosed painting were part of the total experience. The type of weft used to make this piece along with the rendering of the motif of birds in flowers show Central Asian influence. However, the balance and precision of the design are typically Chinese, as is the magic fungus held in the birds’ beaks. The cuteness and intentional awkwardness (zhuo) of the scene are important aesthetic values in traditional Chinese art."
Bowl_with_Flowers_and_Waves,"The six Chinese characters on the bottom of this bowl read “made during the reign of the Chenghua Emperor.” Although the Chenghua Emperor ruled from 1467 to 1487, this particular bowl was made several centuries later. Chinese porcelains are sometimes inscribed with earlier dates; these can be read as both an act of respect toward past traditions and a statement of quality."
Box_with_Landscape_Scenes_and_Auspicious_Emblems,"This box is a quintessential example of the intricate layered surfaces that characterize carved lacquer in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. On the lid a geometric background supports a stylized Chinese character for shou, or longevity, which is itself decorated with auspicious motifs such as bats (the Chinese word for which is a homonym for ""good fortune""). The four raised black-lacquer panels on the side of the box are carved with scenes of deer and cranes-both symbolic of longevity-in landscapes. They are surrounded by lush clouds that contain the Eight Treasures: a conch shell, a lotus wheel, a parasol, an endless knot, a pair of golden fish, a banner, and a treasure vase. These auspicious symbols, derived from Buddhism, appear often in later Chinese art. Boxes of this shape were used to hold small treasures of various materials and are therefore frequently referred to as treasure boxes."
Ritual_staff,"The elaborate decoration on this ritual staff employs the technique of damascening, in which the iron surface is first cross-hatched and then filled with soft gold and silver foils. With a thunderbolt (vajra), a skull, two human heads, and an overflowing vase on its handle, this type of staff served as a symbolic destroyer of obstacles to enlightenment in Tibetan Buddhist rites. The design, workmanship, and materials reflect the high standards of court art under the Yongle."
The_Song_of_Wandering_Aengus_by_William_Butler_Yeats,"Words, books, and calligraphy form central elements of Xu’s work, which often questions the effectiveness of written communication. In this piece, Xu challenges the high-art status of calligraphy within the Chinese cultural tradition while also blurring the linguistic and cultural boundaries between East and West. Xu’s transcription does not retain Yeats’s original format of three eight-line stanzas. Instead, he has divided the poem into two sheets and recomposed the words to resemble Chinese characters. The text is read vertically (as in traditional Chinese texts) and from left to right (as in Western texts). The poem, which ends with the lines “The silver apples of the moon, / The golden apples of the sun,” is from Yeats’s 1899 collection The Wind among the Reeds and reflects his early fascination with the occult."
Vase_with_Garden_Scene,"In the eighteenth century, the kilns at Jingdezhen began to use a new material to produce porcelains. Called huashi, or “slippery stone,” in Chinese, this expensive material is termed “soft paste” in Western writing. Its appearance in China may reflect an awareness of European experimentation with different materials to produce porcelain-like clay bodies."
God_of_Longevity_(Shoulao)_and_boy,"Representations of immortals in Chinese art commonly include children. The boy in this tapestry hanging scroll is an immortal servant. The bald old man with a prominent forehead is the God of Longevity (Shoulao), and the plate of peaches in the boy’s hands a symbol of immortality."
Three_seated_luohans,"Not all images of luohans depict them as exotic, superhuman beings. This sculpture comes from a tradition of realistic luohan representation, in which the figures are presented as familiar old monks with Chinese features. Sitting on roughly hewn rocks, the three luohans engage in study and meditation; they were probably once part of a larger tableau."
Taking_a_Rest,"The Modern Woodcut Movement is an important but understudied chapter in the history of twentieth-century Chinese art. The movement was initiated by Lu Xun (1881–1936), the father of modern Chinese literature and an incisive cultural critic, who saw woodcut as the ideal medium for rousing what he saw as a complacent China from its slumber to face up to the challenges of the modern world. Easily produced from inexpensive materials and with relatively limited training, woodcut was seen as a counterpoint to the precious erudition of literati landscape painting. The medium was used extensively during the 1930s and ‘40s—by both Communist and Nationalist leaders—to disseminate political messages in a graphically impactful, legible form. Some of the most iconic vignettes from the War of Resistance (against Japan, 1937–45) and the Chinese Civil War (1945–49) were produced in this medium. The current set of prints were produced in the Communist milieu—at Yan’an, the mountain stronghold in northern Shaanxi Province that served as the capital of the Communist government during the 1940s."
Valance,"Valances were frequently used in Chinese interiors—on tables and platform beds and above open entryways. Embroidered on this valance are cranes and peaches, auspicious symbols of longevity. The woven silks at the top and bottom date to the eighteenth century."
"Panel_with_Fish,_Bats,_and_Clouds","This panel probably came from a chair cover, possibly from the part that covered the seat. Word play makes the motifs auspicious: five bats (fu, a homophone for the Chinese word for happiness) surround a musical stone and a pair of fish, associated with good fortune and affluence."
Snuff_bottle_in_the_shape_of_a_butterfly,"The butterfly is cherished for its beauty and is a common theme, associated with joy and delight, in Chinese art. Fashioning an object such as this snuff bottle into the shape of a butterfly exemplifies the skill and imagination of the designer."
Chair_Strip_with_Dragons,The primary method of decorating this chair strip is a counted embroidery stitch that completely covers the silk-gauze foundation cloth. The remarkably even tension achieved by the embroiderer is typical of high-quality Chinese textiles done in this technique.
Textile_with_animals_and_woven_inscription,"On this colorful textile, several lively creatures climbing cloudlike mountains are interspersed with Chinese characters that form an incomplete auspicious inscription. The pattern of animals and clouds was popular on Chinese silks from the Han to the Jin dynasty (ca. 1st–3rd century). Textiles with such patterns have been found at archaeological sites all over China, including in the far west, and were often referred to in contemporary documents by complete or partial inscriptions. The inscription on this work includes the characters for ming guang (brightness), which is thought to denote the Ming Guang Palace, built for Emperor Wudi of the Han dynasty. The inscription honors the lord of the palace."
WovenTextile_(Detail),"The oldest Chinese textiles in the Museum's collection (2002.558, .559), these two fragments with a pattern of geometric motifs and birds or dragonlike animals come from the same length of woven silk. The stripes, probably dyed with cinnabar, retain a fresh red color. Cinnabar was mined in China as early as three to four thousand years ago and has been found in Late Neolithic tombs. By the time of the Western Zhou dynasty (ca. 1046–771 B.C.), the Chinese were refining and processing it to obtain the very best red color. Little of the mineral dye was produced, however, and its use was restricted to luxury textiles for the elite."
Box_with_plum_blossoms_and_birds,"The lid of this box has carved plum blossoms and a pair of magpies. As opposed to its association with ill fortune in the West, the magpie is one of the most auspicious birds in Chinese culture because its name is pronounced the same as the word for “happiness” (xi)."
Cup_modeled_after_a_rhyton,"This cup, modeled after a rhyton, or drinking horn, reflects the influence of ancient Persian metalwork, from its octagonal shape to its raised decoration of beaded medallions and palmettes. A distinctively Chinese dragon counterbalances these influences. The high-fired white stoneware and clear glaze exemplify China’s advanced ceramic technology in the sixth century."
Tiered_box_with_a_praying_official,"An official stands before an incense burner on the lid of this box. He may be praying to the heavens on a moonlit night, a traditional Chinese practice. The use of gold underneath the figural decoration is uncommon and suggests that the box was particularly valuable."
Leaf_from_the_Ten_Bamboo_Studio_Manual_of_Painting_and_Calligraphy,"The Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy is one of the earliest and finest examples of color printing from China. The book, which served as both luxury object and guide for the aspiring painter, compiles familiar images from Chinese art, especially flowers, rocks, birds, and bamboo."
Box_with_pommel_scroll,"Red and black are two main colors of Chinese lacquer wares. Although the overall surface of this object appears to feature only red, its elegant pattern was carved out of layers of red and black lacquer to enhance the decorative effect."
Dongfang_Shuo_stealing_peaches_of_longevity,"Dongfang Shuo was an official at the court of Han Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 B.C.) known for his quick wit and humorous quips. He has become a legendary figure in Chinese art: one finds his image in ceramics, hardstone carvings, lacquer, painting, and textiles. Here, he is depicted as a long-bearded old man running away from the garden of the Queen Mother of the West, a Chinese goddess. He carries on his shoulders the peaches he has stolen, which are said to have the magic power to extend life."

Dish_with_garden_scene,"Elegant grounds and inviting pavilions are often depicted on Chinese carved-lacquer works of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. These settings were prevalent in cities in southern China, where they served as entertainment venues and private spaces for self-reflection and renewal."
Freshwater_jar,"During the seventeenth century, as imperial patronage waned, potters at the Chinese kilns of Jingdezhen sought other markets. One of these was Japan, where the popularity of the tea ceremony contributed to growing demand for Chinese ceramics. This porcelain jar, made to hold water during the tea ceremony, was fashioned in the form of a humble wooden bucket, a combination of high and low that appealed to Japanese patrons. The uneven thickness of the glaze and occasional exposure of the clay beneath would have been considered defects in China, but they were prized in Japan for capturing a sense of authenticity."
Vase_decorated_with_floral_medallions,"This lavish vase, produced in the imperial kilns of the Qing dynasty, is a virtual compendium of auspicious images, including lotus, dragons, bottle gourds, and more. Particularly prominent are the bats; because “bat” (fu 蝠) sounds like “good fortune” (fu 福) in Chinese, the animals bear this symbolic meaning."
Box_with_lychees,"The English name for this sweet tropical fruit is derived from the Chinese lizhi. Lychees are understood to represent fertility and are also symbolic of love and romance. Small boxes of this type, used to hold incense, were also produced in metal and porcelain"
Box_with_chrysanthemum_and_praying_mantis,"In China, the praying mantis was appreciated for its skillful hunting with its long front legs. The term for “praying mantis” has the same pronunciation as the word for “handsome man” (lang), and the insect became a popular motif in Chinese art from the sixteenth century on."
Sutra_cover_with_boys_holding_the_stems_of_large_flowers,"Images of boys among floral scrolls, mainly lotuses, were imbued with meaning in the Buddhist tradition. Known as huasheng tongzi in Chinese or mahoraga in Sanskrit, this type of boy symbolizes rebirth from a sacred lotus growing in purified land. The decoration made this textile a fitting cover for a Buddhist sutra."
Eyeglasses_Case_with_Bamboo_on_Fretwork_Background,"Bamboo, a favorite subject in Chinese art, is seen here on a typically Chinese background. The fretwork incorporates the broken cross, or swastika—an ancient symbol in Asia that is associated in China with the character wan, which denotes the number ten thousand and symbolizes longevity. The incorporation of the symbol into an unending pattern emphasizes its meaning.Small overall geometric patterns were commonly mentioned in texts of the Song dynasty (960–1279), and ""endless wan,"" the pattern of connected swastikas, attained dominance by the end of the Ming (1368–1644)."
Vase_in_Shape_of_Archaic_Bronze_Vessel_with_Flowers_and_Birds,"The shape of this vase ultimately derives from archaic vessels used to serve and store wines. The decoration of flowers and birds is ubiquitous in Chinese art; however, the palette used to decorate the piece evolved in the seventeenth century as a refinement of earlier traditions."
Brush_holder_with_scholars_in_a_garden,"This brush pot shows scholars writing, painting, and enjoying nature—activities found in imagery of scholar-officials throughout Chinese art. The scene also recalls famous historical gatherings of learned men such as those in the West Garden, an eleventh-century imperial family residence."
Eyeglasses_Case_Bag_with_Bamboo_on_Fretwork_Background,"Bamboo, a favorite subject in Chinese art, is seen here on a typically Chinese background. The fretwork incorporates the broken cross, or swastika—an ancient symbol in Asia that is associated in China with the character wan, which denotes the number ten thousand and symbolizes longevity. The incorporation of the symbol into an unending pattern emphasizes its meaning.Small overall geometric patterns were commonly mentioned in texts of the Song dynasty (960–1279), and ""endless wan,"" the pattern of connected swastikas, attained dominance by the end of the Ming (1368–1644)."
Goosefoot_Lamp_(Yanzudeng),"Geese are, for the Chinese, a symbol of loyalty and discipline, and lamps in the shape of a goose foot were one of the most popular lamp forms of the Qin–Han era. Bird- or beast-footed vessels were prevalent in the ancient Mediterranean world, suggesting the possible influence of that far-off region."
Casting_Model_for_a_Goosefoot_Lamp_(Yanzudeng),"Geese are, for the Chinese, a symbol of loyalty and discipline, and lamps in the shape of a goose foot were one of the most popular lamp forms of the Qin–Han era. Bird- or beast-footed vessels were prevalent in the ancient Mediterranean world, suggesting the possible influence of that far-off region."
Bottle,"The shape of this vase most likely derives from Indian examples used to sprinkle water and other libations during ceremonies. Such vessels were introduced to China with Buddhism and can often be seen in the hands of bodhisattvas, particularly Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin). One of the Chinese names for vessels of this type is Guanyin ping, or “Avalokiteshvara vase.”"
Box_with_pommel_scrolls,"This design is commonly known as the ""pommel scroll"" pattern because the bracket-shaped scroll resembles the pommel of a Chinese sword. The design was popular in lacquer, ceramics, and metalwork in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and remained important in carved lacquer in the fifteenth century."
Woman's_Informal_Robe_with_Garden_Roundels,"The roundels on this robe show garden rocks with flowers, fruit, and auspicious elements such as the endless knot and bats ( fu, a homophone with the word for good fortune). At the lower edge of the garment, two pairs of Chinese lions gambol with beribboned balls in a flower-filled garden setting."
Seal_of_a_Surrendered_Qiang_Chieftain,"The nomadic Qiang people traditionally lived along China’s western and northwestern frontiers. By the Eastern Han, many had resettled in the interior, and the Han government subsumed them into their populace, requiring them to pay taxes and to render service as laborers or soldiers. In return, their surrendered chieftain received titles and a seal such as this one. In typical Eastern Han calligraphic style, the characters feature elongated shapes and broad, square strokes. The knob is in the shape of a ram, which was standard for officials of non-Chinese background, in contrast to the turtle-shaped knobs for their Chinese counterparts."
Theatrical_vest_for_a_female_Buddhist_priest,"A long vest with patchwork, such as this example, was often worn by a female Buddhist priest in Chinese legendary plays. In such performances, both male and female Buddhist priests are depicted with magic powers to help righteous people in poor circumstances or to subdue demons and save the world."
Woman’s_robe_with_butterflies,"On this robe, scores of delightful butterflies flutter among longevity medallions. Since the word for “butterfly” in Chinese (die) is a homonym for “octogenarian,” the butterfly is a symbol of longevity. It is also usually an auspicious image associated with joy and weddings, and this robe might have been worn for such an occasion."
Engraved_copperplate_for_The_Battle_at_Tam-dy_and_Tru-huu,"This copperplate, made in China and engraved by Chinese craftsmen, is one of six commemorating the Annam Campaign. The adjacent impression was printed from the plate, but because Chinese engravers lacked experience with the European technique of copperplate engraving, it is inferior in quality to its French counterparts.Unlike woodcuts, where the design stands out in relief, copperplate engravings are taken from lines cut into a metal plate. The plates are inked and wiped clean so that ink is left only in the incisions. The images are printed under great pressure from a rolling press that forces the dampened paper into the grooves to absorb the ink. Woodblocks and copperplates are both cut in reverse."
Jar,"Four pearl roundels, each containing the same image of a frontal man's head with a Central Asian face, dominate this jar. Frontal heads surrounded by pearl beading occur in several kinds of early Central Asian art; for example, they appear frequently on unglazed Khotanese earthenwares.Elements of the Buddhist decorative grammar appear here as well: the elongated earlobes are characteristic of images of the Buddha, and the highly stylized palmettes are reminiscent of carvings in some Buddhist cave temples. The tasseled streamers issuing from an ornamental disk are similar to those embellishing late Six Dynasties (220–589) stone figures of bodhisattvas; they also occur in Khotanese earthenwares."
Standing_court_lady,This figure holds a round implement with strings or ribbons that functioned somewhat like castanets.
Sword_with_Ornamental_Fittings,"Bronze swords first appeared in the Western Zhou (ca. 1046–771 B.C.) and remained in use through the Qin. As metallurgy advanced, blade lengths increased: this one measures about three feet. Chinese swords are longer and thinner than those in the West, rendering them more suitable for striking and stabbing."
Dish_with_children_playing_in_a_garden,"The theme of children at play, which expresses a wish for the birth of children and the concomitant joys they engender, is a ubiquitous motif in Chinese decorative arts from as early as the tenth century. Some of the figures seen on this dish—for example, the two boys at left, one riding a hobbyhorse and the other holding a lotus leaf—are a stock figural grouping, appearing on art objects until the seventeenth century. The cluster of leafy palms with rocks and the balustrade enclosing a lotus pond are standard features of Chinese garden designs."
Textile_with_Stripes_and_Confronted_Birds,"The oldest Chinese textiles in the Museum's collection (2002.558, .559), these two fragments with a pattern of geometric motifs and birds or dragonlike animals come from the same length of woven silk. The stripes, probably dyed with cinnabar, retain a fresh red color. Cinnabar was mined in China as early as three to four thousand years ago and has been found in Late Neolithic tombs. By the time of the Western Zhou dynasty (ca. 1046–771 B.C.), the Chinese were refining and processing it to obtain the very best red color. Little of the mineral dye was produced, however, and its use was restricted to luxury textiles for the elite."
Rectangular_box_with_pommel_scrolls,"The pommel scroll is so-named because it resembles the shape of a Chinese sword pommel. This design is often seen in objects decorated with layers of contrasting colors of lacquer, particularly red and black. Found predominantly on ceramics, metalwork, and lacquer from the thirteenth century, there is no known explanation for the creation and popularity of this motif. However, it may have been inspired by the antiquarianism of the period, when motifs that were based on, or presumed to be based on, the Chinese Bronze Age were incorporated into the designs of many types of objects."
Pendant_with_Daoist_divinities,"Both sides of this fruit pit are meticulously carved with images of Daoist immortals, including the fairy Magu with her deer attendant and Shoulao, God of Longevity. The small size and hard surface of fruit stones (usually ganlan, also known as “Chinese olives”) make them extremely difficult to carve, which is why this craft was highly valued. Very few of these objects were created and even fewer survived."
Seated_luohan_(arhat)_in_a_grotto,"A luohan, (arhat, in Sanskrit) is a Buddhist sage who has achieved enlightenment. Groups of sixteen, eighteen, and five-hundred luohans were worshipped in China, where they were a common theme in painting and the decorative arts. The beautifully engraved inscription on this sculpture identifies the luohan as Kanaka, the eighth in the set of sixteen, and explains that the Qianlong emperor had this sculpture made as part of a set of sixteen images for a shrine in the palace."
Male_Palace_Attendant,The elongation of the body and somewhat childish features exhibited here typify works produced in the capital at Luoyang in the first three decades of the sixth century. This distinctive style is understood to reflect an awareness of and appreciation for Chinese aesthetics on the part of the foreign rulers of the Northern Wei dynasty.
Zodiac_figure_of_a_tiger,"Originally created to represent the hours in the Chinese calendar, the twelve zodiac figures gradually assumed other functions over time. This small sculpture, along with other members of the set, would be displayed in the home. The work was believed to protect the residents by dispelling any evil spirits."
Dish_with_Scholar_in_a_Landscape,"Landscape imagery was particularly popular in Chinese ceramics of the mid-seventeenth century, a period often described as transitional, when imperial control of the great kiln complex at Jingdezhen faltered and the lack of oversight allowed potters to develop new shapes and styles of decoration."
Zodiac_Figure_of_an_Ox,"From the Tang dynasty onward, zodiac animals were routinely given human attributes. Here, the figure is envisioned as a Daoist deity holding the head of an ox. The large Chinese character wang (king) on the front of his hat signifies his heavenly identity."
Zodiac_figure_of_a_tiger,"From the Tang dynasty onward, zodiac animals were routinely given human attributes. Here, the figure is envisioned as a Daoist deity holding the head of a tiger. The large Chinese character wang (king) on the front of his hat signifies his heavenly status."
Tree-topped_Shores_and_Distant_Peaks,"C.C. Wang spent much of his life engaging with the history of premodern Chinese landscape painting, both as a collector and a painter. This example shows him engaging synthetically with styles of multiple old masters, including Shen Zhou (1407–1529) and Guo Xi (ca. 1000–ca. 1090), as he constructs a misty riverine landscape."
Container_for_Bulbs,"Most likely used to grow narcissus for the New Year, this elegant container is an interesting Longquan vessel in a shape more commonly associated with the Jun wares of north China. It illustrates the complex interactions between different kilns found in Chinese ceramics from the eleventh to the early fourteenth century."
Buddhist_column,"The column depicts Buddha and his disciples in a mountain landscape. Jade, the material used here, is a hard mineral that is difficult to carve; this piece’s intricate detail and lustrous finish demonstrate the great skill and patience of the Chinese craftsmen who created it."
Mirror_with_two_dragons,"Each of the spirited dragons depicted on the back of this bronze mirror has a slender, sinuous body and a long, ribbed horn. The pair writhe amid waves that swirl around a central boss; four hemispherical knobs may allude to the immortal isles of ancient Chinese cosmology."
Horse_and_rider,"In style and subject matter, this horse and rider with sancai or ""three-color"" glaze is emblematic of funerary sculpture from the early eighth century, the apex of the Tang dynasty. Free-form splatters and drips of colored glaze were first experimented with in the sixth century and the sancai glazes, made by mixing copper, iron, and cobalt to create a lively spectrum of blues, greens, ambers, and yellows over a milky white background, became fashionable in the early Tang for funerary, utilitarian, and export wares. The distribution of glaze on this horse and rider displays a relative degree of control. The colors clarify, rather than obscure, steed, saddle, boot, tunic, and hood. Swift brushstrokes in black detail the rider's brow and mustache, as well as the saddle blanket and horse's eyes, while etched lines stress the animal's musculature.The horse itself was a potent image during the vigorous expansion of the Tang ""golden age."" Chargers such as this large horse were both the reward of military incursions to the west, and the foundation of imperial stability that would in turn encourage trade and prosperity over a vast empire. The most sought-after steeds were known as ""blood-sweating horses""; raised in the western kingdom of Ferghana, they were sent in great numbers as tribute to the emperor. Horses also were a sign of wealth: strict sumptuary laws limited the use of the horses to people of a certain rank and even those serving in the military, such as the hooded soldier saluting from astride this horse, had to provide their own mount."
Travelers_through_Evening_Snow,"Travelers and fishermen in a snowy landscape is a traditional subject in Chinese painting. Here, the theme is rendered in highly refined lines and tonal variations using woodblock-printing techniques that had advanced to such a degree that a print could convey painterly qualities."
Upright_bell_(nao),"The nao type of bell is not suspended, but oriented upwards with its stem set into a socketed base. The unusual form of animal mask ornament suggests that this example was produced in the lower Yangzi River region of southeastern China."
New_Year’s_picture:_God_of_Wealth_riding_on_a_tiger,"In Chinese folklore, a deity almost always rides an exotic animal instead of a horse. The mount for Zhao Gongming, the God of Wealth, is a tiger. He holds a gold ingot, a symbol of wealth, in his left hand and a gnarled cudgel—his signature weapon—in his right hand. Traveling between heaven and earth, he brings good fortune to those who worship him."
"Plough-Puller_and_Wife,_from_the_series_Peasants’_War","K?the Kollwitz was a German graphic artist best known for her often searing portrayals of the victims of poverty, hunger, and war in the first half of the twentieth century. The Expressionistic qualities of her work inspired many contemporary Chinese woodcut artists with Socialist leanings, such as Li Hua, whose work on the same subject is shown next to this moving depiction of the peasants’ woe."

He holds a gold ingot, a symbol of wealth, in his left hand and a gnarled cudgel—his signature weapon—in his right hand. Traveling between heaven and earth, he brings good fortune to those who worship him.."
Landscape_No._882,"C. C. Wang was born in Suzhou in the twilight of the Qing dynasty and died in New York City in the age of the internet. A prominent collector of Chinese paintings, he fed his innovative practice through the study of old masters. This work is an understated and erudite combination of diverse inspirations with Wang’s own inimitable style. The elevated vantage point calls to mind Bada Shanren (1636–1705). The gossamer contour lines of the hills evoke Ni Zan (1306–1374), and the color palette suggests Shitao (1642–1707), all reconfigured through Wang’s own modern sensibility. The result is a work that both honors and transforms tradition. Many of the important early Chinese paintings in The Met’s collection were once owned by Wang."
Mahasiddha_Virupa,"Mahasiddhas were Indian adepts who performed miraculous feats and participated in nonconformist behavior. Virupa’s own transgressive nature is encapsulated in this arresting portrait by two extremes: his enormous paunch implies intemperance, whereas the spotted deerskin, yoga strap, and ritual bone apron signal austerity. His hands make a didactic gesture while the book bound in his hair evokes his role in the protection and transmission of esoteric teachings. This appliquéd and embroidered textile was manufactured in Tibet with Chinese fabrics; note the Chinese designs and characters on Virupa’s seat cushion. This large banner would have been displayed during public rituals and festivals"
Avalokiteshvara,"Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin in Chinese) is a bodhisattva, a divine being who has chosen to remain on earth to help the faithful. This print has framed inscriptions on lotus pedestals addressed to the deity. Below the image is the text of a mantra with a guide to pronouncing it, and a list of the benefits of reciting it."
New_Spring,"This print employs multiple puns to convey its felicitous message. In the Chinese language, “rooster” is homophonic with the character for “good luck.” As the two Chinese characters at the top mean “new spring,” the image of a large rooster completes the congratulatory phrase “Great luck for the New Year.” In the foreground, three yuan (citrons) symbolize success at the three levels of civil service examinations that paved the way to coveted officialdom, because the fruit’s name puns on the top rank at those examinations.The characters near the left margin identify the printshop that produced this image."
Avalokiteshvara,"Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin in Chinese), the Bodhisattva of Compassion, leads believers to the Western Pure Land of Buddha Amitabha. Here, colors were added to the print by hand. The devotee of this work furnished it with dark blue woodblock-printed mounts at top and bottom to simulate the look of a hanging scroll."
Seated_luohan_holding_a_fan,"In 1757, the Qianlong emperor visited the Shengyin Monastery in Hangzhou and saw a set of sixteen luohan paintings attributed to Guanxiu (832–912), a monk-artist renowned for his eccentric depictions of Buddhist adepts. The emperor fell in love with the paintings and commissioned responses in various media, including jade carvings like this one. The figure’s posture and feather fan suggest the luohan Gopaka"
Bounded_by_Mountains:_Mount_Hua,"This album of twelve images was created from a digital scan of a single frame of 35mm film shot while the artist was visiting Mount Hua, the sacred mountain of the west, in winter 2005. Through the subjective and selective process of cropping, the resulting series of images mimics the sense of shifting perspective often depicted in traditional Chinese landscape paintings. Cherney was inspired by theearly-Ming dynasty painter Wang Lü (ca. 1332–1395), who is most famous for his album of scenic studies of Mount Hua and for having advocated the study of nature over that of earlier painting styles in order to achieve realism. The label strip on Cherney's wood album cover bears a seal with a legend that quotes Wang: ""My eye takes Mount Hua as its teacher.""But Cherney reverses Wang's creative process: by enlarging and fragmenting a panoramic vista of the mountain, he transforms objective realism, as captured by the camera lens, into tonal abstraction. Although born and raised in the United States, Michael Cherney has adopted a Chinese name (Qiu Mai) and, in recent years, has been exploring processes that honor traditional Chinese materials, mounting techniques, and subject matter. This work is from his series of printed albums entitled Bounded by Mountains, all produced in a format that combines the technologies of photography, digital printing, and traditional craftsmanship."
Embroidered_Patchwork_Panel,"This patchwork panel comprises various silk textiles, mostly satins and damasks, exquisitely embroidered with the motifs of flowers, fruit, and the occasional butterfly in a technique called needle looping. Worked in silk over gilt paper, the technique allows the luminous gold to show where loops are intentionally skipped. The patches in this Chinese example seem to have been constructed and embroidered as self-contained units that were stitched together to form a larger panel. By contrast, Korean patchwork cloths are usually fashioned from fragments of unadorned, rather than embroidered fabrics, though there are non-patchwork bojagi fashioned from a single cloth with embroidered decoration.This textile was probably used in a Buddhist context but its precise function is unknown. A comparable example, traditionally associated with the Chinese monk Wuxue Zuyuan (1226–1286), resides in the collection of the Buddhist temple Engakuji in Kamakura, Japan."
Immortal,"This pair of figures (with 2015.500.1.12) depicts two young attendants holding large serving bowls. Their unusually large earlobes, quiet expressions with subtle smiles, and long robes with broad sleeves all suggest that they are from the land of the immortals. The substantial size and refined craftsmanship of these sculptures are hallmarks of the imperial workshop, which boasted an ample supply of precious jade material and the most talented carving masters."
Brush_holder_with_Gathering_at_the_Orchid_Pavilion,"Makers of decorative arts often embellished the surfaces of vessels with famous stories. This brush pot depicts the statesman and calligrapher Wang Xizhi and his friends assembling at Kuaiji in 353 CE to celebrate the spring purification festival by drinking wine and writing poems, an event known as the Gathering at the Orchid Pavilion. More than just an appealing landscape with figures, the decoration signaled that the owner of the brush holder understood and appreciated history."
Fire-offering_ladle,"This ladle and its companion (1993.477.1.1a, b) were used to make offerings of fuel during a Homa ceremony. The superb gold and silver inlay is characteristic of early fifteenth-century Tibetan workmanship associated with Derge, Kham Province, eastern Tibet."
Brick_with_Fu_Xi_and_Nu?_Wa,"Fu Xi and Nü Wa played multiple roles in ancient Chinese history and mythology, always occurring as a pair. Nu?Wa’s legend may derive from China’s purported matriarchal past. She is crucial to the myth of creation: after the pillars of Heaven collapsed, she mended the sky by melting stones of five colors and fashioned humans from the yellow earth. For his part, Fu Xi invented nets for fishing and hunting, and he designed the hexagrams, later used in the Yi Jing (Book of Changes), a Confucian classic."
Theatrical_jacket_with_peacock_feather_design,"This jacket from an ensemble (with 32.63.1) features colorful embroidered peacock feathers. Silk flosses in green, yellow, blue, and orange were painstakingly twisted to mimic the feather’s patterns and radiant effects. An exotic bird to the Chinese, the peacock was cherished for its beautiful feathers and is connected with fairies or spirits in Chinese legends.This type of garment is often characterized as an arhat robe (luohanyi), and it is believed that it would have been worn to play the role of a sacred monk in dramas based on Buddhist history. There are many such robes preserved in the Forbidden City in Beijing and elsewhere, and their varied decoration suggests that this form of dress was probably donned by different characters in large-scale court performances."
Lion,"Lions were introduced to China from ancient Persia and India, thereafter capturing the Chinese imagination. Large stone sculptures of lions soon lined the “spirit paths” leading to the tombs of royals and aristocrats, and they became standard elements flanking entrances to government offices and private residences alike. The present example is largely missing its legs, but remnants of its limbs, together with its burly chest and taut haunches, suggest that it originally assumed a striding posture. An inscription on the back of its head indicates that it once formed part of a pair placed at the gate of Luoyang, the Eastern Han capital."
Avalokiteshvara_in_a_Multiarmed_Tantric_Form,"This esoteric form of Avalokiteshvara holds a range of attributes in his twenty-four hands, including the sun, the moon, a vajra, and a bell. Multiarmed, powerful tantric forms of Avalokiteshvara were introduced into East Asia by the monk Amoghavajra as part of an eighth-century effort to repel Tibet’s military expansion across Central Asia. Later, this protective form of Avalokiteshvara, who is able to aid his numerous devotees with his many arms, became especially popular in Tibet after the north Indian monk Atisha (980–1054) emphasized this tantric deity."
Amphora_with_dragon-shaped_handles,"Owing to their large oval bodies and narrow cylindrical necks, vessels of this type have traditionally been called ""amphorae"" and were said to be based on the ancient Greek jar with essentially the same contours. Recently, however, it has been suggested that the shape is derived from Roman glass and metalwork that came to China over the Silk Road. This Western shape has been modified here by the addition of two Chinese features, the high, arched dragon-headed handles and a cupped mouth."
Theatrical_skirt_with_peacock_feather_design,"This skirt from an ensemble (with 30.76.16) features colorful embroidered peacock feathers. Silk flosses in green, yellow, blue, and orange were painstakingly twisted to mimic the feather’s patterns and radiant effects. An exotic bird to the Chinese, the peacock was cherished for its beautiful feathers and is connected with fairies or spirits in Chinese legends.This type of garment is often characterized as an arhat robe (luohanyi), and it is believed that it would have been worn to play the role of a sacred monk in dramas based on Buddhist history. There are many such robes preserved in the Forbidden City in Beijing and elsewhere, and their varied decoration suggests that this form of dress was probably donned by different characters in large-scale court performances."
Seated_Buddha_Vairocana,"The teaching gesture made by this figure, with the thumb of the right hand touching the little finger of the left, identifies him as Vairocana, the celestial Buddha who resides at the center of the cosmos. Vairocana is considered a transcendent form of the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. Though similar in appearance, he exists on another plane, unhindered by a mortal body."
Panel_with_Flowers_in_Vase_and_Scholar's_Objects,"This embroidery illustrates a common theme in Chinese painting and decorative arts: a scene of a scholar’s study. Flowers bloom in a blue-and-white vase; a hexagonal brush pot holds a handscroll, a flywhisk, two brushes, a folding fan, and a ruyi scepter; and an ink stone and mountain-shaped brush rest await the master’s return. On this beautifully made panel, the flowers are embroidered with miniscule pearls rather than white thread."
Wine_container_(hu),"This ritual wine container with exquisite inlaid decoration illustrates a major innovation in China’s bronze tradition in the late Eastern Zhou dynasty (770–256 BCE) when, inspired by the nomadic art of the steppes, Chinese craftspeople applied sumptuous surface decor to otherwise austere bronzes. It also epitomizes a critical change in the function of bronze vessels from ritual objects to vehicles for the display of wealth and status."
Vessel_in_the_shape_of_a_leather_wrapper,"This exceedingly rare, if not unique, piece not only represents a cross-medium artistic exchange, but also a cultural exchange between Chinese and northern nomadic peoples during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The unusual shape and brownish color suggest that it was intended to mimic a leather wrapper or parcel that would have been a common accoutrement of nomadic culture. The two rectangular holes cut into the top surface may have originally held a ribbon handle. The white porcelain body and brown iron glaze identify it as coming from Ding County (Hebei), which was the most important center of white porcelain production during the eleventh century. Located close to the border between the Chinese Song state and the nomadic Khitan Liao kingdom, this kiln site served both Chinese and nomadic patrons. After 1127, when the semi-nomadic Jurchen peoples conquered the northern portion of Song China, this county entered the territory of the Jin dynasty. It is very likely that this vessel’s distinctive leather-like form was commissioned by a Khitan or Jurchen patron."
Snuff_bottle_with_Mi_Fu_bowing_to_a_rock,"A famed poet, painter, and calligrapher, Mi Fu (1051–1107) was also noted for his eccentricities, which included the collecting of stones. He declared one stone to be his older brother, and sometimes bowed to this rock as a mark of respect. Representations of Mi Fu bowing to a rock are often found in Chinese painting, as well as in the decorative arts."
Shaft_or_mandrel_for_jade_carving,"These steel drills with blunt points (zhuangding or dingzi in Chinese), flat heads (tuozi), or curving heads (wazi) are used for high relief carving, undercutting, and fine shaping of small jade works. The craftsman holds the jade in one hand against the drill, which is mounted on a spinning shaft. He or she rotates the shaft using foot treadles, while continuously applying abrasives, usually sand mixed with water, to the tip of the drill, which cuts the jade."
Gouge_for_carving_jade,"These steel drills with blunt points (zhuangding or dingzi in Chinese), flat heads (tuozi), or curving heads (wazi) are used for high relief carving, undercutting, and fine shaping of small jade works. The craftsman holds the jade in one hand against the drill, which is mounted on a spinning shaft. He or she rotates the shaft using foot treadles, while continuously applying abrasives, usually sand mixed with water, to the tip of the drill, which cuts the jade."
Small_engraving_wheel,"These steel drills with blunt points (zhuangding or dingzi in Chinese), flat heads (tuozi), or curving heads (wazi) are used for high relief carving, undercutting, and fine shaping of small jade works. The craftsman holds the jade in one hand against the drill, which is mounted on a spinning shaft. He or she rotates the shaft using foot treadles, while continuously applying abrasives, usually sand mixed with water, to the tip of the drill, which cuts the jade."

He or she rotates the shaft using foot treadles, while continuously applying abrasives, usually sand mixed with water, to the tip of the drill, which cuts the jade."
Badge_with_Five-Clawed_Dragon_Surrounded_by_Plum_Blossoms,"Badges with festival symbols were not used at the Chinese court after 1644, and those showing plum blossoms are especially rare. Plum-blossom badges were appropriate for the winter solstice, a festival of the eleventh lunar month. Both the form of the dragon's head seen here and the embroidery technique have close parallels in the finds from Dingling, the tomb of the Ming-dynasty Wanli emperor (r. 1573—1620)."
The_Military_Door_Guard_“Bring_in_Emoluments”,"Door guards function to ward off evil spirits from the house. This warrior with exotic facial features, however, holds a small dish on which sits a deer icon. In Chinese, the word for “deer” is homophonic with the character for “emolument,” thus conveying the wish for a higher salary.Together with its pendant at right, this print forms part of a pair of military figures flamboyantly dressed in costumes with intricate designs. Its soft blue and rose palette is characteristic of Suzhou prints from the Kangxi era (1662–1722)."
Panel_with_Rabbits_amid_Clouds,"The rabbits running among clouds are intended to symbolize the moon, which is inhabited by rabbits in Chinese tradition. Richly brocaded with gold thread, this textile is both luxurious and auspicious. A similar length of gauze was found at Dangling, the mausoleum of the emperor Wanli (r. 1573–1620) in suburban Beijing, and it seems likely that this piece dates from the same period."
Sleeveless_Jacket_with_Flowering_Vine_Pattern_and_Bands,"The elaborate banding at the edges of this garment is typical of Chinese women's clothing of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The especially complex forms seen at the center front and sides are used here as an independent design motif, but in earlier times, four such lobes constituted the ""cloud collar"" pattern, which decorated the upper part of garments."
Nine_Dragons,"This painting follows the manner of the most celebrated dragon painter in Chinese history, the scholar-official and Daoist master Chen Rong. Chen famously avoided depicting the complete forms of his dragons, preferring to preserve their mystery by partially obscuring them in mists and clouds. In places, the artist of this work depicts a dragon in its entirety, one of the signs that it is a later painting in Chen’s manner. The inscription at the end is either a copy of an authentic Chen Rong or an outright fabrication."
Bodhisattva_Guanyin,"Guanyin (in Sanskrit, Avalokiteshvara), the bodhisattva of infinite compassion, is one of the most commonly depicted Buddhist figures in Chinese art. She was believed to have the ability to bless every suffering person in the mortal world. Although in India the bodhisattva was originally understood to be either genderless or male, in China, female manifestations such as this one were common."
"Daoist_Immortal,_probably_Laozi_(老子)","This sculpture epitomizes the merging of religious and secular imagery in later Chinese Buddhist sculpture. With his shaven head and elongated earlobes, the figure resembles a luohan (one of the Indian disciples of the Buddha), but his refined facial features, dignified posture, long-sleeved robe, and pointed shoes—all attributes associated with Confucian scholar-officials—identify him unmistakably as a youthful monk.The sculpture’s tendency toward abstraction and stylization—the contours of the head, body, and robes are conveyed through the buildup of simple, curved forms—recall thirteenth-century images, but a radiocarbon date suggests that the piece dates to between A.D. 1324 and 1617."
Screen_Panel_or_Kang_Cover,"Two Chinese lions playfully circle a brocade ball in the central roundel of this panel, surrounded by a field of birds in flight and various flowers on a scrolling vine. Each corner's quarter medallion contains a phoenix roundel, and the border features clouds and cranes. The dual orientation of the panel vertically—either short side could serve as the top—lends support to the suggestion the cloth once found use as the cover for a large piece of furniture such as a daybed, or kang."
Chair_strip_with_phoenixes,"In a traditional Chinese reception hall, chairs for the hosts are set in pairs on either side of a central table and are covered with textiles that are not adhered directly onto the furniture. Made with velvet, the textiles provide not only comfort but also a pleasing aesthetic due to their shine and elegance. Here, the motif of phoenixes among peonies symbolizes noble women, making these pieces suitable for use in a lady’s quarters."
Ornamented_Plaques,"This set of decorative plaques includes four nearly identical square pieces and one narrower rectangular form. On each of the plaques, beaded borders enclose finely granulated ground on which thin gold strips and turquoise inlays form a floral design. A braid made of gold threads extends between the borders and the design, composed on connected trefoils extending into the corners with a circle at the center.Technically and stylistically, these plaques are typical of ornaments found at seventh- and eighth-century sites in eastern Central Asia and in the northwestern Chinese province of Qinghai. Chinese sources indicate that metalworking flourished in this region under Tibetan dominion during the seventh and eighth centuries. The use of the trefoil motif and granulation provides evidence of active cultural and trade contact between West Asia and China."
Twenty-five_bust_portraits_of_famous_scholars,"A series of twenty-five bust portraits spreads across this handscroll like a procession. Close examination of the paper reveals that each portrait was originally labeled, but these labels were removed prior to the painting’s entry into The Met collection, so it is difficult to identify the figures. They appear to be famous scholars from throughout Chinese history; the man with the distinctive dark beard and tall black hat near the end bears a striking resemblance to other portraits of the scholar and statesman Wang Yangming (1472–1529). Further research may reveal the identities of other figures."
Bottle_in_the_shape_of_a_double_gourd,"The double gourd holds considerable appeal among the Chinese. In addition to its peculiar shape, it is associated with the fantasy world: immortals and legendary figures are believed to use double gourds to carry medicines with magic power. Numerous baby gourds hanging from a single vine, as shown on this bottle, allude to multiple offspring and a continuation of the family line."
Twin_boys,"The four bodies and two heads of this sculpture belong to four entwined boys—one pair seated and the other kneeling on all fours. The group represents the principle of ancient Chinese cosmology known as liangyi sheng sixiang, in which two primary forces (yin and yang) generate four images. The design, which can be read either vertically or horizontally, further exemplifies the artist’s familiarity with rotational symmetry."
Buddha’s_hand,"The Buddha’s-hand citron takes its common name from the shape of its fruit, which resembles the idealized fingers of the Buddha. Although the fruit is not edible, it has a strong fragrance and is used as an offering at the altar. Its name in Chinese, foshou, has almost the same sound as the words for “fortune” (fo) and “longevity” (shou), adding another layer of good wishes."
Ruyi_Scepter,"One translation of the Chinese term ruyi is ""as you wish,"" and scepters in this shape were often given as gifts because of the good wishes they implied. Although they may have had certain ritual functions, scepters frequently appeared in displays, either placed on stands or in vases and brush pots alongside other functional and/or exotic goods. Ruyi scepters were made in a range of materials including metals, various types of wood, and ivory."
Chair_strip_with_phoenixes,"In a traditional Chinese reception hall, chairs for the hosts are set in pairs on either side of a central table and are covered with textiles that are not adhered directly onto the furniture. Made with velvet, the textiles provide not only comfort but also a pleasing aesthetic due to their shine and elegance. Here, the motif of phoenixes among peonies symbolizes noble women, making these pieces suitable for use in a lady’s quarters."
Panel_with_immortals,"The Eight Immortals (baxian) and God of Longevity (Shoulao) in Chinese legend are always depicted in a group celebrating the birthday of the Queen Mother of the West. Here, six of the immortals stand in the foreground and two on the terrace alongside the God of Longevity. Together, they salute the Queen Mother, who rides a mythical bird (yuan) in the sky. This meticulously embroidered work would make an ideal gift for an important birthday celebration."
Cup_with_horses,"Cups like this one reflect the seventeenth-century Japanese taste for Chinese porcelain. They also reflect a change in Japanese tea culture brought about by ōbaku monks from China, who arrived with a new form of tea that was popular on the continent. Unlike traditional powdered tea, whisked in deep bowls, the new tea (called sencha in Japan) was brewed by steeping whole, unfermented leaves in pots and served in small cups. In size, form, and aesthetic, this cup would have been perfectly suited to Japanese sencha practice."
Rank_Badge_with_Bear,"The bear represents the fifth military rank. While the birds used in Chinese rank badges correspond to actual species, the animals usually do not. Instead, many are fantastic animals, and all were chosen for their supernatural power. Bears on rank badges do not resemble bears in nature. Instead, they often feature an upswept mane, an emphasis on the paws (very long in this example), and an extended tail."
Door_valance_and_side_panels_with_dragons,"The striking five-clawed dragons and the impeccable quality of this valance and side panels set suggest that it decorated a doorway in an imperial residence. The figure of the dragon has a number of associations and incarnations—all positive—in Chinese mythology. Here, the dragons primarily signify the emperor as the Son of Heaven and the intercessor between heaven and earth on behalf of the people."
Box_with_camellia,"The stylized flowers depicted in Chinese lacquer are often difficult to identify precisely. However, the large blossom on this box is probably a camellia, a flower associated with winter and endurance. This box is one of several, most found in Japan, which bear the name Zhang Cheng (here, carved into the base). He is one of only two fourteenth-century lacquer artists whose names are recorded."
Scholar's_Rock,"This natural piece of limestone, gray with a faint tint of green, resembles a rugged mountain in miniature. Its rough surface, layered with horizontal fissures and interspersed with indentations, evokes cliff walls marked with eons of natural erosion. It sits on a wooden stand made precisely to fit its base. The stand is supported on six short legs and decorated with a row of hemispheric bosses on its outer rim.The object's dramatic silhouette and fine linear texture are characteristic of the highly prized ornamental Lingbi rocks from Lingbi County, Anhui Province. The structure and the decorative program of the wooden stand embody the elegance and refinement of craftsmanship peculiar to 18th-century Chinese wood carving."
Folding_screen_with_figures_in_a_landscape,"The scenes in this set of eight pictorial panels represent prosperity in traditional Chinese ideology. Here, farmers and fishermen enjoy the harvest; craftsmen and women busily produce silk and paper; auspicious cranes and deer gather for a longevity celebration; and travelers journey on domestic and foreign ships. Carved out of soapstone and glued onto silk, these relief figures are all depicted in extreme detail. Their discernible but subtle facial expressions further demonstrate the artist’s sophisticated skill in figural representation."
Page_from_Shi_Zhu_Zhai,"The Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy is one of the earliest and finest examples of color printing from China. The book, which served as both luxury object and guide for the aspiring painter, compiles familiar images from Chinese art, especially flowers, rocks, birds, and bamboo. The examples chosen for this display feature bird-and-flower subjects."
Panel_with_birthday_celebration,"This tapestry is part of a set of large ornamental panels. Among the guests honoring the elderly couple are several lively children, probably their grandsons. The man and his wife wear matching robes, appropriate dress for court officials and their wives. As a birthday gift, the three boys at their feet present a hanging scroll bearing the character for longevity (shou) in blue, surrounded by five red bats (fu). Bats were typically used to represent good fortune, as the words are homophones in Chinese."
Table_valance_with_phoenix,"In a traditional Chinese reception hall, chairs for the hosts are set in pairs on either side of a central table and are covered with textiles that are not adhered directly onto the furniture. Made with velvet, the textiles provide not only comfort but also a pleasing aesthetic due to their shine and elegance. Here, the motif of phoenixes among peonies symbolizes noble women, making these pieces suitable for use in a lady’s quarters."
Arhat_(Luohan),"This sculpture epitomizes the merging of religious and secular imagery in later Chinese Buddhist sculpture. With his shaven head and elongated earlobes, the figure resembles a luohan (one of the Indian disciples of the Buddha), but his refined facial features, dignified posture, long-sleeved robe, and pointed shoes—all attributes associated with Confucian scholar-officials—identify him unmistakably as a youthful monk.The sculpture’s tendency toward abstraction and stylization—the contours of the head, body, and robes are conveyed through the buildup of simple, curved forms—recall thirteenth-century images, but a radiocarbon date suggests that the piece dates to between A.D. 1324 and 1617."
Fan_with_Landscape,"Although at first glance this fan appears to have been painted, the landscape was actually delicately embroidered with fine silk thread. The inscriptions reiterate the imagery of mountains and pines, both symbols of longevity in Chinese culture. While the cylindrical date inscribed on the fan can be read as either 1651 or 1711, the latter is more likely. The ink inscription on the case dates it to 1737, which is when the case was made for the fan."
Peach-shaped_Cup_with_Saucer,"According to myth, Xiwangmu, the queen mother of the west, had an orchard producing peaches that granted immortality, and the peach thus became a symbol of long life. The outer surface of this peach-shaped cup features a branch with leaves and blossoms, giving the impression that the fruit is still attached to an otherworldly tree. The cup's rim is enhanced with a tiny bat (fu), a pun with the word for blessings. (From Longevity in Chinese Art)"
Ruyi_Scepter_in_the_Shape_of_a_Fungus_of_Longevity,"One translation of the Chinese term ruyi is ""as you wish,"" and scepters in this shape were often given as gifts because of the good wishes they implied. Although they may have had certain ritual functions, scepters frequently appeared in displays, either placed on stands or in vases and brush pots alongside other functional and/or exotic goods. Ruyi scepters were made in a range of materials including metals, various types of wood, and ivory."
Vase_decorated_with_auspicious_animals,"The five pairs of birds on this vase stand for the five basic relationships (wulun 五倫) in premodern Chinese society. Phoenixes on perforated rocks near magnolia trees symbolize the relationship between ruler and official. Cranes to the left of them represent father and son. Mandarin ducks swimming by lotuses in the pond signal husband and wife. Two wagtails resting atop the magnolia trees stand for siblings, and orioles in flight evoke friendship."
Box_with_camellias,"The lacquer body is built on a red-orange ground and has a thin layer of lacquer near the top that outlines the camellia blossoms and leaves in red, an allusion to the color of this flower that blooms around the Chinese New Year. As is typical of the thirteenth century, there is little overlapping of leaves and petals, and much of the ground is exposed. The lack of incisions to indicate the veins of the petals and leaves is another thirteenth-century characteristic."
Dish_with_immortals_playing_weiqi,"Lotus-shaped dishes like this one were produced primarily during the short reign of the Xuande emperor. While two of the figures wear scholars’ clothing, the short cape of leaves adorning the shoulders of the man seated at center right identifies him as a Daoist immortal. He and one scholar play a chess-like game (weiqi) by moonlight—a common motif in Chinese art and literature."
Vase,"This octagonal-fluted vase attests to a cycle of artistic exchange across media, regions, and time periods. Realized through the use of modern European glass technology, the design of this vessel was inspired by ninth-century Yue celadon ware. Interestingly, these early Chinese celadon vessels were themselves believed to have been inspired by imported glass vessels from Central and West Asia."
Flask_with_molded_decoration,"The mold-impressed design on either side of these two jars is suggestive of classic Greek ornament. The scrolling grapevine decorative motif has an ultimate Hellenistic prototype; it can be traced from the West through Central Asia to China. This design became part of the Chinese decorative repertoire in several kinds of art in the Six Dynasties (220–589) period. (According to tradition, the domesticated grape itself was introduced into China from the West in the second century B.C.)"
Imperial_Court_Robe,"On this robe, woven from threads of silk and gold, five-clawed dragons (long), clouds, and flaming jewels appear against a rich blue ground above waves and mountains. Scattered among the dragons are variants of the Chinese character shou (longevity), making this robe an especially appropriate garment for birthday celebrations.The embroidered neck and sleeve bands were made later than the tapestry-woven textile used for the robe."
Luohan_with_a_lion_cub,"Enlightened Buddhist disciples are known in China as “luohan” (arhat in Sanskrit), and they have been an important subject in Chinese art since the tenth century. They are often depicted in groups of sixteen, eighteen, and even five hundred figures. This rock-crystal figure can be identified as Vijraputra, who is often shown playing with a lion cub. Here, the lively cub and meditating luohan illustrate the coexistence of joy and peace."
Water_dropper_in_the_shape_of_a_crane,"A crane holding a branch of peaches symbolizes longevity. The crane is believed to live for more than a thousand years and has been associated with immortals who would ride on its back. The peach is understood to have more potent life-extending power. In Chinese legend, the fruit grows on sacred trees in the garden of the Queen Mother of the West and ripens every three thousand years; a person who eats it will live forever."
Fairy_and_Crane,"The young lady walking on a bridge, carrying a long-handled sickle and a basket of plants, and accompanied by a white crane, may be Magu, a famous Chinese fairy who symbolizes eternal youth. She brews immortal wine from magic plants, such as those in her basket, and artworks with her image are ideal birthday gifts. In addition to the refined embroidery on this panel, tiny pearls and coral beads are used to render the white crane and the red pomegranate seeds."
Chest_with_the_Expulsion_of_Hagar,"This chest's lid is decorated with an unusual portrait of a pope, most likely Sixtus V (r. 1585–90). The Old Testament tale of Abraham's expulsion of Hagar and her son, Ishmael, to appease his barren wife, Sarah, is depicted on the front of the chest. While the composition was based on European prints, the use of a screen for the background adds a Chinese flair."
"Luohan,_after_a_set_attributed_to_Guanxiu","Of the many luohan painters throughout Chinese history, none was more influential than the Buddhist monk Guanxiu (832–912), whose wild caricatures inspired generations of artists to depict luohans as exotic, superhuman beings. Guanxiu’s paintings were already considered rare in 1757, when the Qianlong emperor encountered what he believed to be an authentic set in a monastery in Hangzhou. To preserve their appearance, the emperor commissioned copies and had them carved in stone so that rubbings like this one could be made. The original painting is now lost, making these copies some of the most important surviving evidence of Guanxiu’s style."

Hand_Warmer,"Painted enamel was originally limited to European-style objects, but later became a popular design element for traditional products in the Chinese domestic market, such as hand warmers. Made to hold glowing pieces of charcoal embedded in ash (and sometimes incense for a pleasant fragrance), this vessel would have been a source of comfort on a cold day."

Roof-Tile_End,"Tile ends are a decorative and functional component of traditional Chinese architecture. Connecting to a half-cylindrical tile, these round pieces functioned as eave covers. In the Warring States period, the patterned part of the tile end was made with a mold, and the clay edge was added by hand. By the later Qin period and continuing into the Han, both parts were made together in a mold before being connected to the premade half-cylinder. They have smoother edges as a result."

Presentation_box_for_a_brush,"This luxurious lacquer box was designed to hold a writing brush from the imperial workshops. The main images on the box are of bats flying over waves. In Chinese, the word for “bat” is pronounced the same as “fortune” (fu). Thus, the bat is an auspicious animal symbolizing good fortune, as opposed to its negative connotations in the West."
Kneeling_Warrior,"This warrior sports distinctive headgear that resembles a type fashionable in ancient Greece and Rome. The figure was recovered in the far northwest of China at a site linked to nomadic peoples, perhaps the Scythians, who dwelled in that region from the fifth to third century B.C. Although crudely cast, the figure’s well-modeled shoulders, arms, and collarbones reveal an awareness of human anatomy—a characteristic of the Hellenistic sculpture that Alexander the Great introduced into Central Asia in the fourth century B.C. Nomadic peoples helped transmit this influence to their Chinese neighbors."
Two_Armored_Warriors,"These figures were among 363 terracotta warriors excavated at Yangling, the mausoleum complex of Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 B.C.). They presumably represent infantrymen. Small holes at their shoulders suggest that they once had movable wood arms pegged to their bodies, while traces of textiles in the ground where they were found indicate that they were once clad in cloth robes. Their armors, originally made of wood or leather, have long perished. While their faces are strikingly naturalistic, their torsos and limbs are highly stylized, conforming to a method deeply rooted in traditional Chinese figural art."
Guanyin_the_Bringer_of_Sons,"A rare example of ecclesiastical painting from the end of the Ming period, this richly colored painting presents Guanyin (Avalokiteshvara in Sanskrit), the Bodhisattva of Infinite Compassion, in a peculiarly Chinese manifestation as the provider of male offspring. Guanyin is seated on a lion (a symbol of royalty in India), descending toward the worshiper on a plume of clouds while holding a baby in his arms. The child is girded by a jewel-encrusted belt and holds an imposing seal, both emblems of high official rank. Below him is the adoring figure of Sudhana, the young boy whose auspicious birth enabled him to set forth immediately on a quest for spiritual enlightenment."
One_of_a_Pair_of_Vases_with_Dragon_Handles,"The dragons in the four openwork cartouches on this vase are strikingly similar to those found on the robes in this gallery and illustrate the ubiquitous sharing of motifs that characterizes Chinese art in the Qing dynasty. This vase was most likely part of a set that included another vase, incense burner, and candlesticks, which would be displayed in public rooms and on ancestral altars. This vase is designed to be rotated on its base, a technical embellishment that is also (rarely) found in porcelain but has no true function."
"Wrist_Rest_with_Scene_from_""The_West_Chamber""","The motif of a woman reading a letter is most likely based on a woodblock print illustrating a scene from a fourteenth-century play known as either The West Chamber or The Romance of the West Chamber. This play, which tells of the convoluted romance between a young scholar and a beautiful woman, is one of the most well known in Chinese history, and allusions to some of its more famous moments are often found in the visual arts."
Cup_with_character_for_longevity_(shou),"Cups like this one reflect the seventeenth-century Japanese taste for Chinese porcelain. They also reflect a change in Japanese tea culture brought about by ōbaku monks from China, who arrived with a new form of tea that was popular on the continent. Unlike traditional powdered tea, whisked in deep bowls, the new tea (called sencha in Japan) was brewed by steeping whole, unfermented leaves in pots and served in small cups. In size, form, and aesthetic, this cup would have been perfectly suited to Japanese sencha practice."
"Box_with_gardenia,_plum_blossoms,_and_finches","The technique of combining fine basketry weaving with Chinese lacquer first appeared in the late sixteenth century. Basketry panels were installed on the sides of lacquer containers that were used to present gifts and important documents. The colorful painting of birds and flowers on this cover probably came from a pattern book, as multiblock color printing became popular in southern China in the same period."
Dish_with_the_Three_Friends_of_Winter,"Pine needles, bamboo leaves, and plum blossoms fill the center of this deeply carved dish. Plum blossoms, which are among the first flowers of early spring, are often associated in Chinese art with evergreen pine and bamboo. Together, the trio are known as the “Three Friends of Winter,” a motif symbolizing how a lofty individual perseveres even in the harshest environment."
Textile_fragment_with_boys_and_birds_in_pomegranates,"This strip of silk features two clusters of pomegranates and leaves. The fruits, which are known for their many seeds, are filled with birds and flowers at the top, while those at the bottom hold boys and flowers. The inclusion of boys inside the pomegranates may refer to offspring: the Chinese character for “seed” is the same as that for “son.”"
Box_with_chi_dragons_amid_clouds,"Known as chi, the feline dragons that curve along the surface of this box were inspired by comparable creatures found on Bronze Age vessels, which were rediscovered during the Song dynasty and often reinterpreted in the arts of that period. Although they lack the large horns, prominent snouts, and scaled body of the typical Chinese depiction of the dragon, chi dragons are also regarded as auspicious and protective."
Textile_with_confronted_birds,"Although symmetry is a basic element of Chinese design, the motif of a pair of confronted animals or birds on either side of a plant was not known in China until the opening of the silk routes in the second century B.C. The pattern seen on this embroidery—birds standing on lotus blossoms (a motif derived from Buddhist art)—was popular in the early Tang period."
Box_with_Pommel_Scroll_Design,"The lush spirals carved into the lacquer illustrate a design commonly known as “pommel scroll” because the bracket-like shapes resemble the pommel of a Chinese sword. This motif was popular in lacquer, ceramics, and metalwork in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and remained so in carved lacquer, as both a primary subject and as a decorative embellishment, for centuries."
Chimera_(Bixie)_(a);_magnifying_glass_(b),"Miniature depictions of animals began to appear in the middle of the Han dynasty. The perforation in the body of this solid gold chimera suggests that it was worn as a pendant or perhaps as one of several “beads.” Such ornaments are likely to have been inspired by small animal-shaped hardstone beads that were imported from South and Southeast Asia. Hardstone beads have been discovered in Han royal tombs in many Chinese provinces. They have also been excavated from contemporary sites along the coast of Vietnam and Thailand as well as in source countries including northern Pakistan, and Afghanistan."
Lozenge-Shaped_Dish_with_Garden_Scene,"Chinese literati enjoying gardens became a common subject in the art of the late Ming period. Artists typically included stock figures based on woodblock prints, such as the musicians gathered in the pavilion on this dish. Here, the men play a mouth organ (sheng), a zither (zheng), and possibly clappers. One young attendant carries another type of zither (qin), suggesting that the two gentlemen outside the pavilion will be joining their fellow musicians."
Tray_with_scholars,"This dish depicts Chinese literati, or scholar-officials, engaging in leisure activities. In the foreground, three such men, identifiable by their clothing, travel on horseback toward a gate attended by two figures holding large fans. The trio in the middle ground examines a painting displayed by a pair of young attendants. The other scholars are either strolling in the garden, reading books, enjoying tea, or engaged in conversation."
Box_with_“peach-blossom_grotto”,"Three Chinese characters incised on a rectangular piece of shell at upper right identify the scene on this box as the “peach-blossom grotto” (tao yuan dong). The phrase refers to a famous poem by Tao Qian (365–427) in which a fisherman enters a grotto and stumbles upon Shangri-la. As is invariably the case with such magical realms, once the man leaves the cave he is never able to return."
Traveling_box_with_lotus_scrolls,"This extraordinary box, most likely made for a Tibetan visitor to the Chinese court, would have been used to carry belongings, both personal goods and gifts such as porcelains and textiles. The large lotus scrolls painted on the sides, and in particular the spiky blossoms, derive from Nepali artistic traditions that were introduced to China in the late thirteenth century. Such floral design also became a standard motif commonly found among early Ming imperial works in various media including cloisonné enamel."
Skirt_from_Theatrical_Ensemble_for_a_Female_Role,"A close look at this colorful design of phoenixes amid scrolling vegetation reveals transformations in the pattern: some of the flowering areas have heads. This transformational potential is present in the patterns of many Chinese costumes. In addition, the embroidered design of this skirt is identical to that of a theatrical jacket in the Qing court collection of the Palace Museum, Beijing."
Lamp_in_the_Shape_of_a_Seated_Man,"This sturdy man in a rigid seated posture boasts thick eyebrows, large eyes, a high nose bridge, and a full beard, distinguishing him as non-Chinese. He is sometimes described as being naked because of the curved contour lines visible on the body, but two incised lines around his neck may represent the collar of a thin garment. The sketchy vertical incisions below the collar lines may delineate the rough texture of a woven textile."
Large_Roof_Tile_End,"Tile ends are a decorative and functional component of traditional Chinese architecture. The example here is believed to have appeared at the end of a rooftop. The geometric relief pattern represents one of the two known decorative programs for such tiles. The pattern likely represents mythical yunqi, or “clouds and life energy,” a motif used to evoke immortality. Positioning such tile ends on a rooftop connected the building with the heavens, symbolizing it permanence."
Pouring_Vessel_(Kendi)_with_Flowers_and_Fruits,"Chinese manufacture of this drinking vessel with a long neck and a spout, known as kendi (a Malay word), began during the fourteenth century for export to Muslim communities in Southeast Asia. By the sixteenth century it was carried farther afield to the Middle East, where Persian copies were made. This late sixteenth-century version, not necessarily made for export to Europe, is decorated in patterns that commonly were applied to kraak porcelain."
Pillow_in_the_Shape_of_a_Twin-Headed_Bird,"Stuffed with plant stalks, this pillow features a pattern of stylized birds and beasts. Interspersed are Chinese characters reading, “extend years, increase longevity, and benefit sons and grandsons.” The two tips forming bird’s heads have led to the pillow’s identification as a “rooster-crowing pillow” (jimingzhen), a burial item intended to carry the deceased into heaven, but no historical texts of the period can corroborate the term. The two-headed form more likely represents a mythical bird than an actual rooster."
Box_with_Lid,"Each half of this box resembles a phiale, a type of lobed bowl from Achaemenid Persia (550–330 B.C.) that was common in western Asia during the Hellenistic period (323–31 B.C.), a time of frequent exchange between the Parthians and the Greeks. While the hammering technique points to a Persian origin, the combination of two bowls into a lidded box is found in neither the Iranian nor the Greek world. The box is, rather, an example of Chinese artists finding innovative uses for imported works."
Unarmored_General,"This unarmored figure can be identified as a military officer by his size (larger than most) and headdress (a distinctive cap split into two folded peaks). The cap may refer to the “pheasant’s-tail cap” recorded in Chinese historical texts, in which case two feathers would have been inserted at the back. Such caps became customary adornment for military officers, owing to the pheasant’s combative nature. It is still uncertain which of the figures’ features indicate their ranks and responsibilities, though the bows on the armors of some terracotta generals are speculated to signal rank."
Lamp_in_the_Shape_of_a_Mythical_Bird,"This lamp, typical of southern Chinese bronzes, demonstrates a design innovation particular to the Han, a form of hollow-bodied lamp known as gang (literally, “hollow”). Smoke emitted from the lit fuel would enter the lamp via a point of ingress—in this case, the mouth and neck of the bird (likely a phoenix or a peacock)—and accumulate in the hollow inner body, which usually contained water. The smoke was therefore contained, and would not prove a nuisance to those nearby."
Dish_with_two_boys,"Scenes of boys at play, which originated in the Song period (960–1279), are common in Chinese decorative arts. They express the wish for offspring and the joy of having them. One of the two lively fellows at the center of this small plate is riding a hobbyhorse, a toy that may have originated in China; the other plays a drum. Sprigs of bamboo, plum, orchid, and chrysanthemum decorate the borders."
Textile_Fragment_with_“Longevity”_Design,"This fragment is meticulously embroidered with a stylized cloud pattern in four colors: pink, orange, green, and blue. The vivid patterns express the ancient Chinese ideology of immortality. The inventory of the tomb’s burial goods, written on bamboo strips, records this type of textile as a “longevity embroidery” (changshou xiu), providing sound evidence of the Han-period name for this decorative motif."
Pair_of_dishes_with_scenes_from_Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms,"The narrative scenes on this pair of dishes probably derive from woodblock-print illustrations of the popular Chinese historical novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo Yanyi). One vignette depicts General Liu Bei and his two sworn brothers at the house of Zhuge Liang, the scholar and strategist who helped Liu win many battles and found the Shu State during the Three Kingdoms period (220–65). The scene on the other dish has yet to be identified."
Folding_screen_with_birthday_celebration_for_General_Guo_Ziyi,"The primary decoration of this screen records a birthday celebration for Guo Ziyi (697–781), one of the most famous generals in Chinese history. Engaging scenes of children at play, symbolic of longevity and good wishes, fill the densely carved roundels below.The inscription on the top left bears the name of Lu Kuisheng, an allusion made by the screen’s unknown artist to this nineteenth-century lacquer master."
Large_Roof_Tile_End,"Tile ends are a decorative and functional component of traditional Chinese architecture. The example here is believed to have appeared at the end of a rooftop. The geometric relief pattern represents one of the two known decorative programs for such tiles. The pattern likely represents mythical yunqi, or “clouds and life energy,” a motif used to evoke immortality. Positioning such tile ends on a rooftop connected the building with the heavens, symbolizing it permanence."
Box_with_Scenes_of_a_Departure,"Images of gentlemen traveling in the evening are common in Chinese pictorial lacquers, and it is possible that pearl shell was understood to be an appropriate medium for the depiction of a moonlit landscape. The vase and other vessels in the pavilion at left illustrate shapes found earlier in ceramics and metalwork and reflect the fascination with elegant living often found in the arts of the late Ming period."
Robe_for_Tibetan_aristocrat_(chuba),"In addition to bolts of cloth, court robes were often sent from China to Tibet in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries where they were refitted into a style of dress worn by lay aristocrats. Close examination of the dragons on the upper part of this robe reveals that parts of their bodies do not match precisely, which suggests that this garment was either made from a larger one or pieced together from different robes. Such reworking illustrates the value awarded to Chinese textiles in Tibet at the time."
Archaic-style_vase_with_dragons,"This vessel takes the form of an ancient bronze ritual wine container (fanggu). The dragons, a contemporary addition, enliven the classical model with a new sensibility. The Qing-dynasty vessel would not have been used for wine, like its ancient inspiration, but was a decorative object designed to display the owner’s learned taste."
Immortal,"This pair of figures (with 02.18.411) depicts two young attendants holding large serving bowls. Their unusually large earlobes, quiet expressions with subtle smiles, and long robes with broad sleeves all suggest that they are from the land of the immortals. The substantial size and refined craftsmanship of these sculptures are hallmarks of the imperial workshop, which boasted an ample supply of precious jade material and the most talented carving masters."
Vase_with_landscape_scenes,This idyllic landscape enjoyed by scholar-gentlemen directly recalls contemporaneous court paintings that evoke tenth- and eleventh-century traditions.
Vase_with_Peony_Scroll,"The complicated technique used to create the striking decoration on this jar is often classified by the Italian term sgraffito, which means scratched. The vase was covered first with a white slip and then a black slip, which was then carved to create the design of the large peony scroll."
Textile_with_Pearl_Roundels_with_Dragons,"The decorative use of rows of pearls ultimately derives from Sasanian Iran. The dragon has been a significant presence in Chinese art for thousands of years, but those depicted here have no heads. A flaw in the weave program may explain this anomaly, or the textile may have been woven in Central Asia, where the dragon motif was less well understood."
Theatrical_skirt_with_designs_from_Buddhist_jewelry,"The pattern of this skirt—part of a theatrical ensemble with matching jacket 30.76.22—features peony leaves and flowers on the shoulders, above a band of scrollwork that resolves into a pair of confronting dragons. The lower part of the pattern consists of suspended beads, punctuated by various auspicious motifs—endless knots, swastikas (wan in Chinese, meaning “ten thousand” and signifying eternality), bats, coins, musical stones, and ribbons. These decorations are often found on Buddhist jewelry (yingluo) usually worn by a bodhisattva."
Theatrical_jacket_with_designs_from_Buddhist_jewelry,"The pattern of this jacket—part of a theatrical ensemble with matching skirt 30.76.21—features peony leaves and flowers on the shoulders, above a band of scrollwork that resolves into a pair of confronting dragons. The lower part of the pattern consists of suspended beads, punctuated by various auspicious motifs—endless knots, swastikas (wan in Chinese, meaning “ten thousand” and signifying eternality), bats, coins, musical stones, and ribbons. These decorations are often found on Buddhist jewelry (yingluo) usually worn by a bodhisattva."
Fly_Whisk,"An instrument of literati dandyism in Chinese culture, the fly whisk is often depicted in early paintings and decorative arts, however, few actual examples are preserved. The hexagonal, tinted ivory handle of this piece is decorated with two rows of lotus petals. The macramé ferrule is edged with copper wire and has a raised design of an attenuated dragon chasing a tin pearl."
Flask_with_molded_decoration,"The mold-impressed design on either side of these two jars is suggestive of classic Greek ornament. The scrolling grapevine decorative motif has an ultimate Hellenistic prototype; it can be traced from the West through Central Asia to China. This design became part of the Chinese decorative repertoire in several kinds of art in the Six Dynasties (220–589) period. (According to tradition, the domesticated grape itself was introduced into China from the West in the second century B.C.)"
Vase_with_Animals_and_Mythical_Creatures,"Porcelains painted with enamels in which the color green predominates are often classified as famille verte, based on the writings of the nineteenth-century French collector and connoisseur Albert Jacquemart (1808–1875). It should be noted that French terms such as famille verte are used only in Western and not in Chinese scholarship and have, therefore, not been used here."
Cauldron_(Fu),"These bronze cauldrons, known as fu in Chinese, are typical of the cooking vessels associated with the nomadic people of the steppes. Their history extends from the early first millennium B.C. to the first few centuries of our era, and they were distributed over much of the Eurasian continent—from the shores of the Black Sea to China's northern frontier. Examples with a pierced ring foot appear to date later than those with a solid ring foot, mostly from the third century B.C. or thereafter."
Large_Cup_with_Ring_Handle,"The flat bowl, attached ring handle, and raised entwined palmettes on this cup are typical of works produced under Tibetan rule in the seventh and eighth centuries. Chinese historical annals record the extensive and extravagant use of gold and silver in Tibet during this period. However, this production has only recently been identified, largely on the basis of similar pieces excavated at sites in northwestern China."
Cauldron_with_lid_(Fu),"These bronze cauldrons, known as fu in Chinese, are typical of the cooking vessels associated with the nomadic people of the steppes. Their history extends from the early first millennium B.C. to the first few centuries of our era, and they were distributed over much of the Eurasian continent—from the shores of the Black Sea to China's northern frontier. Examples with a pierced ring foot appear to date later than those with a solid ring foot, mostly from the third century B.C. or thereafter."
Landscape_No._880126,"C. C. Wang spent a lifetime engaging with the history of Chinese painting. As a young man in Republican-period China, he studied painting and connoisseurship with the leading scholar-painter Wu Hufan, and after moving to the United States he continued to develop as a collector, artist, and mentor to many in the field. This painting, made when Wang was in his eighties, refers to the style of Fan Kuan (active ca. 990–1030), but the bold blocks of color and ink wash also reflect Wang’s concerted engagement with modern art."
Ritual_wine_warmer_(Jue),"A jue is used to serve warm wine during rituals. Its particular shape—flared, pointed, triangular legs; ovoid body; long curved spout counterbalanced with a pointed flange; and two columnar protrusions—makes jue one of the most easily identifiable ancient Chinese bronze and pottery vessel forms. In later periods, jue were still made for ritual use and Qing-dynasty (1644–1912); examples often have elongated legs."
Mirror_with_moon_goddess_and_rabbit,"Depicted on the back of this mirror is the goddess Chang’e who, according to Chinese folklore, flees to the moon after stealing the elixir of immortality from her husband, the brave warrior Hou Yi, who saved the earth by shooting down nine of the ten scorching suns. She resides on the moon with a toad and a rabbit who uses a pestle and mortar to grind the magical ingredients of the elixir."
Vase_with_rabbits,"High-fired porcelain decorated with intense blue pigment under a clear glaze reached an unprecedented height of technical excellence and artistic sophistication during the Ming dynasty, when fine porcelain wares were mass produced and sold to many parts of the world. Their decoration attests to the active cultural exchanges facilitated by maritime trade. The animated rabbits are derived from Chinese sources, whereas the arabesques of scrolling vines and flowers are common motifs in Islamic art."
Ritual_wine_warmer_(Jue),"A jue is used to serve warm wine during rituals. Its particular shape—flared, pointed, triangular legs; ovoid body; long curved spout counterbalanced with a pointed flange; and two columnar protrusions—makes jue one of the most easily identifiable ancient Chinese bronze and pottery vessel forms. In later periods, jue were still made for ritual use and Qing-dynasty (1644–1912); examples often have elongated legs."
Yang_Guifei_in_a_Flower_Garden,"Yang Guifei, the beloved consort of the Tang emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–56), is a favorite subject in Chinese literature and art for her beauty and tragic death. Here, she is depicted in a garden. The emperor is partially concealed behind the lattice screen. The peonies in the corner are often associated with Yang. The color may have been applied by hand with the use of stencils to create painterly textures."
Mr._Mei_Makes_an_Exchange_through_Trickery,This print shows two lovers stepping through a moon gate into a bedroom under the cheerful gaze of a maid. The blossoming prunus (mei in Chinese) reaching over the garden fence signals early spring while punning on the male protagonist’s name for additional resonance between word and image. The scene was taken from a popular late Ming (1368–1644) drama entitled All Things Fulfilled.
Textile_with_deer_and_a_woven_inscription,"This textile features a small repeating pattern of deer in various postures and six auspicious Chinese characters, all placed along a continuous undulating horizontal.The woven inscription includes the characters for ming guang (brightness). Textiles of the ming guang type are referred to by that term in ancient texts until as late as the reign of Shi Hu (335–49) of the Later Zhao kingdom (328–51)."
Pair_of_Stirrups,"Although close in form to the well-known style of Mongolian, Chinese, and Tibetan stirrups still in use in the region today, this pair, with its slender proportions and accomplished decoration, is earlier and finer than most examples of this type. The dragon heads are chiseled in high relief with deep undercutting and some piercing. The treads, where the rider's feet would rest, are decorated with the interlocked design known as the King's Earrings, damascened in silver."
Chasuble,"This deep red satin chasuble was embroidered in China. Its slender, A-line shape was common in chasubles of eighteenth-century Spain, where it may have been used.[1]The focal point of the embroidered design is the roundel with a double-headed eagle at the center of the vestment’s front and back. Although the double-headed eagle surmounted by a crown was a symbol of the Habsburg monarchy, here it is purely decorative and tinged with an auspicious Chinese flavor.[2] Instead of grasping arrows in their talons, as they would in the Habsburg motif, the birds dangle flowering and leafy stems from their beaks. In Chinese textiles auspicious birds frequently hold symbolic flora: a rank badge in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection features a crane that grips a branch bearing both a peach and a peach blossom.[3]The front and back of the chasuble are each divided into three vertical sections, separated by narrow embroidered floral trim that also borders the neck and edges.[4] The central section consists of a series of vertically aligned roundels, floral rosettes, and geometrically decorated vessels resting on stands amid a simple ogival pattern of flowering vines. On each of the two side sections, a graceful design of delicately curving leafy stems emerges from a multicolored cornucopia, a long-standing European motif. Cornucopias are included in at least two other eighteenth-century chasubles embroidered in China, one now in the Metropolitan and the other in the Museo Nacional del Virreinato, Tepotzotlan, Mexico, and formerly in the Catedral de Mexico—a reminder that there were markets besides Europe for chasubles embroidered in China.[5]The scrolling pattern of the side panels is punctuated with large flowers, some of which include elements from Chinese decorative arts and others that are unusual from a Chinese perspective—even quite fantastic. The large flowers close to the cornucopias on the front of the garment and flanking the eagle roundel on the back are rather unrefined in technique, featuring dots on their radiating petals and a bold red, white, yellow, and blue coloration that lacks the more subtle shades of light red seen in the smaller flowers nearby, a customary coloration in Chinese embroidery. As dotted petals are fairly common in Indian floral textiles of the eighteenth century but unusual in Chinese examples, these bold flowers and other similarly distinctive blooms may reflect the Chinese embroiderer’s attempt to mimic the Indian floral patterns that were so popular in international trade.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]Footnotes1. Johnstone, High Fashion in the Church, p. 109.2. Some examples of purely decorative double-headed eagles are found in Portuguese collections. See, for example, the detail of an eighteenth-century colcha in Pacheco Ferreira, As alfaias bordadas sinoportuguesas, p. 158, fig. 108.3. Metropolitan Museum, acc. no. 36.65.10. Doubly auspicious, the crane represents the highest rank for a civil official, and both crane and peach are associated with longevity.4. Another chasuble, embroidered in China and now in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection (acc. no. 61.227), also has a tripartite division and a similar embroidered trim.5. For the Metropolitan’s example, see note 4 above; for the chasuble in Mexico, see Mayer et al., Raiment for the Lord’s Service, pp. 274–75, no. 140."
Portrait_of_a_Gentleman,"A gentleman with a long, flowing beard sits on a tiger skin draped over a chair of luxurious carved lacquer. Behind him, a standing screen holds a painting of misty mountains. His robe of rich vermilion is adorned with a rank badge featuring two cranes; if accurate, such a badge would indicate that he was a civil official of the first rank, but people sometimes stretched the truth in premodern Chinese portraits to elevate their achievements. A portrait such as this one might have been made during the lifetime of the recipient, but after his death it would have been venerated in the family’s ancestral shrine or hall."
Book_from_the_Sky,"This set of four books forms part of an eponymous installation first displayed in Beijing in 1988. The books contain four thousand invented characters that cannot be decoded, raising fundamental questions about the Chinese identity and its relationship to the written word. The artist believes that writing is the “essence of culture.” His subversion of it speaks to our need to communicate and the dangers of distorting or eliminating intended meaning.Born in Sichuan Province, Xu Bing studied printmaking at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. Book from the Sky and other projects have brought him considerable international renown. He moved to the United States in 1990 but returned to China in 2008 to teach at his alma mater."
Teabowl,"This teabowl represents a classic type that originated in Song-dynasty China and was later produced in Japan. Its most prominent characteristic is the striking “hare’s-fur” glaze, named for the iridescent grayish-brown streaks resembling a thick growth of hair. Chinese teabowls of this type became highly prized in Japan, especially among Buddhist monks, during the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries. Later, similar vessels were produced in Japanese kilns, mainly in Seto."
Vessel_in_the_Form_of_a_Heavenly_Rooster,"Containers in the shape of a rooster carrying a vessel on its back are an invention of Song dynasty (960–1279) antiquarians, who believed that such ritual vessels existed in the classical age of ancient China. Several bronzes similar to this one were catalogued as “heavenly rooster vessels” (tianjizun) in the collection of Emperor Qianlong (r. 1736–95), who had a deep interest in antiquarianism. The term “heavenly rooster” comes from a Chinese legend about a mythical bird whose crowing awakens the whole world."
The_Military_Door_Guard_“Rise_in_Rank”,"This warrior with a soft expression and slanted eyes holds a basin in which a dynamic blue goblin wields a book and a rice measure while looking back at a branch bearing three yuan (citrons). The impish figure is Kuixing, a star in Chinese astrology in charge of letters. The three citrons symbolize success at the three levels of civil service examinations that paved the way to coveted officialdom, because the fruit’s name puns on the top rank at those examinations."
Water_Pot_with_Boys,"Archaeological evidence indicates that the kilns near Dehua, in Fujian Province, opened in the late thirteenth century and flourished after the sixteenth, when they became known for their distinctive white porcelains with thick, lustrous glazes. The Dehua kilns produced a range of goods, including religious figures and objects for the scholar's table such as this charming water pot. Works produced at the kilns were also exported to Europe, particularly in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and, as a result, are often referred to in Western literature as blanc-de-chine, a French term meaning ""Chinese white."""
White-Robed_Guanyin,"According to Buddhist belief, Guanyin (Avalokiteshvara, in Sanskrit), Bodhisattva of Infinite Compassion, reveals himself in many forms. In one such manifestation, known simply as the White-Robed Guanyin, the Bodhisattva sits on the rocky island of Putuo (Potalaka, in Sanskrit), believed by the Chinese to be located offshore from Ningbo, in Zhejiang Province.The poem was inscribed (from left to right) by Quanshi Zongle:The body is as small as specks of dust and as ephemeral,So is the doctrine ephemeral and small as specks of dust;The world of all living things is but emptiness,And so Guanyin’s compassionate heart is at rest.Quanshi Zongle, appointed by the first Ming emperor to the highest administrative position governing Chan institutions, served as abbot of the Tianjie temple, near Nanjing, first about 1375 and later from 1388 until his death in 1391. The painting, inscribed at the Tianjie temple, is datable to the end of the fourteenth century."
Box_Lid_with_Competition_Scene,"The scene on the lid represents the moment in ancient Chinese history when Li Yuan captured the hand of Princess Dou by shooting two arrows, each of which penetrated the eye of a peacock. Painted in brilliant shades of red, blue, and green, the rural scene shows Li Yuan shooting at a peacock depicted on a screen while the princess and her attendants watch from the safety of a pavilion. Li Yuan later became Emperor Gaozu (r. 618–26) of the Tang dynasty (618–906), and the theme is an important one in Ming-period decorative arts."
Wrist_rest,"Chinese is traditionally written vertically, from right to left and from top to bottom. An armrest is often placed over the last line on the paper while a new line is being written, so that the ink will not be smeared by a wrist or a sleeve. Armrests are usually rectangular, with a concave section, like a roof tile. This example is carved in the reserve-green technique. The yellow-green skin of the bamboo is partially preserved as highlights against a background of the darker and more fibrous inner layer."
Panel_with_Peonies_and_Rocks,"This panel probably came from a chair cover. Chinese chairs were not upholstered but were covered with long decorative chair strips, which often had independent pattern zones for the four parts of the chair they covered. Viewed from the front, three zones corresponded to the front legs, the seat, and the chair back; the fourth zone decorated a small section that hung behind the chair at the top. It is likely that this panel is from the part of a chair strip that covered the chair's front legs. The view is of a garden scene with peonies, rocks, and a magnolia tree on a decorative gold background."
Furniture_Cover_with_Lotus_and_Dragon_Scrolls,"This cover for a seating platform (kang) or a large chair seat has a pattern of floral and dragon scrolls that was carefully designed to appear right side up when viewed from any of its four sides. The graphic quality of the design is achieved through differences in the reflectivity of the two surfaces on the face of the velvet. The background is rendered in cut pile, which tends to absorb light, while the pattern consists of uncut loops, which are more reflective. Fairly common in Chinese velvets, this use of cut and uncut areas to delineate the pattern allowed considerable freedom of design but demanded great skill."
Recovering_the_Tripod_from_the_Si_River,"This rubbing was taken from a stone engraving on a chamber wall of the Wu Family Shrine in Jiaxiang, Shandong Province, constructed about 151 CE. It illustrates the failed attempt of the tyrannical first emperor of the Qin dynasty (r. 247–210 BCE) to retrieve from the Si River one of the legendary Nine Tripods, a symbol of the legitimacy of the state since antiquity.The image shows a dramatic moment during an attempt to lift the tripod from the water. A dragon head emerges from the vessel and bites through the ropes. The tripod begins to sink back into the river under the gaze of the large figures on top, one of whom is probably the emperor. The failure may presage the doom of his empire (221–207 BCE), the most short-lived in Chinese history."
Theatrical_robe_with_eight_trigrams,"This robe features symbols used in Daoist divination, including a black and white roundel (taiji) on the front and back, and eight sets of black trigrams (bagua). A theatrical garment like this was generally worn to play a strategist with magic power. It was used, for example, by an actor playing Zhuge Liang (181–234) from the play Yangping Pass.On view during Rotation 1 of exhibition from June 25, 2016 through January 13, 2017."
Ewer,"The earliest securely dated Chinese cloisonné, in which colored glass paste is applied within metal enclosures and fired, dates from the reign of the Ming Xuande emperor (1426–35). However, cloisonné is recorded during the previous (Yuan) dynasty (1271–1368), and it has been suggested that the technique was introduced to China at that time via the western province of Yunnan, which under Mongol rule received an influx of Islamic people. The shape of this ewer, which was introduced to China in the early fifteenth century, also derives from Islamic metalwork"
Immortal_Holding_a_Peach,"The figure on this silk tapestry panel is Dongfang Shuo who symbolizes wisdom and longevity. As a historical person, Dongfang (154–93 B.C.) was famed for his immense erudition and humorous speeches. In later legend, as seen here, he steals the magical peaches from the orchard of the Queen Mother of the West (Xiwangmu) and becomes a famous immortal. The layout and powerful outlines, also present in sixteenth-century painting, help date this tapestry. Found on both sides of the panel, the red seals state that it had once been stored in the imperial study of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1736–95), one of the greatest art collectors in Chinese history."
Wall_panel_with_poetic_scenery_of_autumn,"This panel features enameling with an exceptional tonal range and gradation of color and finely tooled metal cloisons. The intricately rendered “blue-and-green” style landscape is based on a pictorial model created by a court artist. Composed by the Qianlong Emperor, the poem on the top left follows a brushed model provided by the scholar official Yu Minzhong (1714–1779), who served as chief grand councilor, editor, and scribe to the emperor. Such a complex collaboration between emperor, official, and imperial workshops only occurred during this golden age of Chinese court-sponsored art."
Hanging_Lamp_in_the_Shape_of_a_Foreigner,"Commerce with Asia and the Mediterranean not only brought exotic goods to China but also led to contact with foreign peoples, who became a popular subject in art. This figural lamp has identifiably non-Chinese features: deep eye sockets, a high-ridged nose, and curly hair tied in a topknot. His hollow body served as the fuel chamber, and a small aperture in his chest allowed fuel to flow into the circular tray. Among the numerous lamps excavated in China, this is the only known example to have chains, which points to the influence of the Mediterranean, where hanging lamps were prevalent."
Ink_Tablet_with_Peach_Tree,"Ink for calligraphy and painting was made from soot mixed with a binding medium and formed into ink tablets, which were then ground with water to yield the liquid ink. Ink tablets were among the objects especially treasured and keenly appreciated by Chinese scholars.This ink tablet is decorated with a design of a peach tree, symbolic of longevity. An inscription indicates that it was made in 1576 in the workshop of Fang Yulu (active ca. 1570–1619) under the supervision of Cheng Dayue (Cheng Junfang, 1541–ca. 1616), both famous inkmakers"
Dagger-Ax_with_Ferrule,"The dagger-ax (ge) was the chief hand weapon of the Chinese army until the Eastern Zhou period (771–256 B.C.), when the two-pronged halberd (ji) replaced it as the infantry’s and newly formed cavalry’s weapon of choice. By the Western Han period, the dagger-ax served only as ritual paraphernalia.Exquisitely crafted bronze dagger-axes with gold, silver, or gilded finials and ferrules (zun) are often found in pairs among the tomb furnishings of princes. The duck-shaped finial and hoof-shaped ferrule of the present example suggest that it was a ceremonial weapon, used in ritual processions."
Lamp_in_the_Shape_of_a_Ram,"The ram, the word for which in Chinese is pronunced similarly to the one for “auspicious,” was a common symbol of luck. This “golden ram” is a paean to Han ingenuity. Via a hinge on its neck, the ram’s back opens for use as an oil receptacle (see ill.), and a spout ensures that leftover fuel flows back into the hollow body. This exceptional piece accords with the appreciation of a gold ram lamp expressed in a Han poem: A person of virtue is diligent in work, and only feels the day is too short. / A golden ram lamp is lit up, extending the daylight."
Wine_Container_(Hu)_with_Mythical_Bird,"Known as hu or zhong, globular vessels such as this one were used most frequently as wine containers. The massive size of this example renders it one of the largest of its kind known to date. More important, however, were its contents at the time of its discovery: 26 liters of a green liquid, well preserved on account of the tightly closed lid. The liquid included 0.1% alcohol along with minor amounts of other materials commonly found in Chinese wine, confirming textual records of the vessel’s function as a wine container"
Strongman,"Acrobatics in China originated in antiquity and by the Qin–Han era had developed a full repertoire of moves, including rope walking and sword swallowing. This large figure was found with ten others in a pit near the First Emperor’s tomb. The group is believed to have represented an acrobatics troupe performing at the imperial court.The figure has an imposing physique and brawny hands, which together with his wide stance suggest his role as a strongman. He and a partner once held a pole, atop which another performer could swing, balance, and twist. The striking accuracy of his anatomy, hitherto unknown in Chinese figural art, has led to speculation that he was inspired by the Hellenistic sculptures that Alexander the Great introduced into Central Asia a century earlier."
Bodhisattva_Avalokiteshvara_in_Water_Moon_Form_(Shuiyue_Guanyin),"After the tenth century, one of the more prominent representations of Avalokiteshvara shows the bodhisattva seated with the right knee raised and the left leg crossed before the body. The posture represents the Water Moon manifestation, understood as a depiction of the divinity in his Pure Land, or personal paradise. Known as Mount Potalaka, Avalokiteshvara’s Pure Land was originally thought to be located on an island somewhere south of India. By the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), this mythical paradise had been identified with Mount Putuo, an island off the east coast province of Zhejiang, and had become an important pilgrimage site."
Pair_of_Belt_Plaques_with_Winged_Horses,"Unlike the ornaments favored by the Xiongnu, few plaques or other adornments used by the Xianbei are known. Gilt plaques embellished with images of flying horses similar to these have been excavated at sites on the Manchurian plain in northeast China; however, it is rare for a pair with facing horses to survive.The name Xianbei refers to a confederation of tribes that spoke different languages and came from varying regions. Originally part of the Xiongnu empire, the Xianbei broke away and resumed control of their lands in the mid-first century B.C. From that time until the sixth century A.D., they played a complicated role in Central Asian and Chinese history. The Xianbei ruled many of the small states that vied for control of North China from the third to the mid-fifth century. The Tuoba, a subsidiary branch of the eastern Xianbei, established the powerful Northern Wei dynasty that ruled North China from the mid-fourth to the mid-sixth century.The first chapter of the Wei Shu (History of the Wei), written in the mid-sixth century by the Chinese historian Wei Shou, preserves most of what little is known about the Tuoba prior to the establishment of the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534). According to this source, a mysterious animal spirit that was shaped like a horse and bellowed like an ox led the Tuoba south on the perilous journey from their homeland in Heilongjiang Province (in the far northeast of China) over the Daxing'an Range and into the Inner Mongolian plain. It is possible that the winged horses on this pair of plaques illustrate the legendary event."
Embroidered_Panel_with_Daoist_Magician,"A Daoist magician stands in a spare, rocky landscape holding a bottle from which four tiny bats emanate. The bottle is labeled with the Chinese character fu, or happiness, which is a homophone with the word for ""bat."" The scene also features trees and flowering shrubs, including tree peonies in the foreground. The collectors' seals along the edges of the work appear to be problematic, except for a small vertical rectangle on the right side, which is the mark of the collector A. W. Bahr, who owned the textile before it entered the Museum's collection."
"?ikhin,_one_of_the_Buddhas_of_the_past","In 1777, the Panchen Lama, high cleric of Tibet’s Tashilhunpo Monastery, sent a gift of seven paintings to the Qianlong emperor, each of which depicted one of the Buddhas of the past. As a sign of respect for this gift, Qianlong had them recreated in several forms: as polychrome paintings, as stone carvings, as rubbings of those stone carvings, and finally as paintings in gold on deep blue paper. This thangka, which depicts ?ikhin, second of the seven Buddhas of the past, survives from a set of this final form, which transmutes the stark white on black visual idiom of the rubbing into a luxurious, shimmering gold on midnight blue. The painting is inscribed with a hymn in praise of ?ikhin, which is rendered in the four official languages of the Qing court: Chinese, Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan. The poem reads:Hymn to ?ikhinThat which arises from good factors is fundamentally illusory;That which creates evil karma, too, is fundamentally illusory.With a body [ephemeral] like accumulated foam and a heart [diffuse] like wind,He casts out illusions, which are rootless and without reality."
Buddha_Maitreya_(Mile)_altarpiece,"Maitreya is the only divinity in Buddhism revered as both a bodhisattva and a Buddha. Slated as the next being to achieve enlightenment, he exists on the verge of Buddhahood, his bodhisattva’s vows completed and the promise of enlightenment assured. Devotion to Maitreya was widespread in China in the late fifth and sixth centuries. This complex assembly shows Maitreya emerging from a halo of flames as he descends to earth to rescue the devout."
Rectangular_Box_with_Scene_of_a_Reception,"The scene represented on this box is the arrival of guests at a grand reception. The host and hostess are seated in the reception hall at the upper right of the composition, which resembles that of a traditional Chinese-style horizontal or hanging scroll. A member of the household stands before the hosts, awaiting a messenger carrying a pink calling card. The guests, who are about to cross a stone bridge, are shown in the lower part of the painting. On their way to the reception, the guests will pass a group of musicians playing behind silk curtains. Most of the musical instruments they use are displayed in the case nearby."
Qur'an_Juz'_XXVII,"The earliest surviving Chinese Qur'ans date to the fifteenth century and were associated with Chinese Sunni Muslim communities called the Hui. The Qur'ans were divided into juz' (one of thirty parts into which the Qur'an is divided) and followed a standard format that endured throughout the Ming Period (1368–674) and later.This juz' is written in Sini script, a variation of muhaqqaq (one of the six canonical proportional scripts). Several of its folios are illuminated with decorative patterns characteristic of Sini Qur'ans. These are typically executed in gold and outlined in black, green, and red ink. The patterns and motifs found in these Qur'ans include overlapping circles, eye-shaped and lobed cartouches, four-petalled floral diesigns and star-shaped geometric forms, and plaited framing devices. This juz' features ornate swirling vegetal designs in the outside borders and is bound in richly decorated stamped brown leather binding featuring Sini calligrams in teardrop-shaped medallions, sinified cartouches, and medallions."

Mater_Dolorosa_(Mourning_Virgin),"The Chinese characters on the bottom of this sculpture indicate the colors used for the various patterns on the robes and help catalogue it as a work of art produced by an artist trained in China, as does the style of the rocks upon which the Madonna sits. The mournful expression of the face of the Virgin, the clasped hands, and the seated position are typical of representations of the mourning Madonna (mater dolorosa), an image of the Virgin Mary that represents her sorrows during the sufferings of her Son, a theme that was popular in music and ritual during the eighteenth century. The sculpture was most likely produced either in Fujian Province or by an artist trained in that area but working in the Philippines."
Brush_washer,"The combination of thicker dark lines and thinner brown lines seen in the glaze on this brush washer is known as “gold thread and iron wire.” This type of glazing is one of the characteristics of Ge ware, which is thought to have been produced in the Hangzhou region, possibly in the same kilns that made the Guan, or official, ware for the court. The surface design is also an allusion to the rare, imperial Ru ware of the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127), revered for the lush crackle in its glaze."
Ritual_Wine_Vessel_(Jiao),"This elaborate set of wine vessels provides an idea of the splendor of Shang and early Zhou ritual ceremonies. The set is said to have come from a tomb uncovered in 1901; shortly thereafter, it entered the collection of Duan Fang, a senior Manchu official and one of the preeminent antiquarians of the late Qing period.The pieces vary in style and execution. Although eleven of the vessels are inscribed, only one grouping shares identical inscriptions: the two wine containers, or you (nos. 2, 3) and the tall wine container, or zun (no. 4). A second grouping has largely comparable inscriptions: the spouted water vessel, or he (no. 5) and one cup, or zhi (no. 11).A partial reconstruction of the set’s arrangement in the tomb may be established from corrosion outlines on the three principal vessels—the two wine containers, or you, and the central tall wine container, or zun—that were etched onto the surface of the altar table. The diagram shows a hypothetical arrangement of the remaining vessels around the major pieces. Even if this is accepted as the original grouping, the disparate inscriptions and vessel styles remain unexplained. Created around the time of the Zhou conquest of the Shang, and clearly by different foundries, the pieces of the set may represent the accumulated wealth of a family shrine.青銅禁1.

Camel_with_Dionysian_imagery_on_its_saddle_bags,"This pottery model of a Bactrian camel may be a rare example of a Chinese-style tomb figure produced in eastern Central Asia. The identity of the central figure on the packboards is uncertain. He may represent the Indian Kubera, king of the yakshas, who is portrayed in drinking scenes being waited on by women. However, the full beard and absence of headgear are unusual in depictions of Kubera. Another interpretation of the scene is that the three figures were inspired by representations of the Descent from the Cross, an important theme in early Christian iconography that may have been transmitted along the Silk Road."
Folding_chair_with_two_birds_among_flowers,"A very rare example from the early Ming dynasty, this chair illustrates the sophisticated craftsmanship of the lacquer and furniture from the period. The folding legs are well balanced with the armrests and curved back, which together create a stable and beautiful structure. Except for the rattan seat, all surfaces of the chair are made of lacquer. In addition to the meticulously carved geometric background, the chair also features a pair of paradise flycatchers among flowers on the back panel. Known as an “awarding ribbon” (shoudai) in Chinese, this type of long-tailed bird is a symbol of fortune and longevity."
"Manjushri,_the_Bodhisattva_of_Transcendent_Wisdom","This monumental appliqué shows Manjushri with his identifying attributes—a sword and book on adjacent lotuses—riding a blue lion. Manchu rulers, especially Emperor Qianlong (r. 1736–95), revered this bodhisattva; the Suzhou imperial workshop likely fabricated the piece as a gift to a Tibetan monastery. Various silks were used: silk strips to suggest the volume of the folds in his garment and couched silk cords to delineate the lion’s mane and tail. Above, the blue Buddha Akshobhya attests to Chinese familiarity with Tibetan conventions. At lower left is the pilgrim Sudhana, the ideal devotee who receives teachings from Manjushri."
"Banner_with_Bodhisattva,_possibly_Mahamayuri","This colorful banner from the renowned Buddhist cave temples near Dunhuang is an important example of early Chinese Buddhist painting. It consists of two parts that may or may not have matched each other originally. The smaller triangular piece features a Buddha seated on a lotus flower in a meditative posture. A bodhisattva standing on a lotus pedestal, richly decorated with precious accessories, fills the scroll.The banner was likely displayed in a temple or the interior of a cave sanctuary, possibly in honor of the main icon in a complex. It could also have been hung outside a building or carried on a pole in ceremonies of various types."
Bowl_with_four_horses,"Known as ko-sometsuke, or “old blue-and-white” in Japanese, this type of Chinese porcelain was made for the Japanese market in the early seventeenth century. Such works often feature relatively coarse bodies and glazing as well as “naive” pictorial designs. Such “imperfections” were intentionally created to achieve a natural, even a humble aesthetic effect that was highly appreciated by Japanese tea masters. A bowl like the current piece would have functioned as a serving dish for sweets offered at an upscale tea ceremony. Its lively decoration and irregular shape would have perfectly enhanced the aestheticized assortment of objects used on such occasions."
Door_Guard_Zhao_Gongming,"As door guard, Zhao Gongming is usually paired with the Lamp-lighting Daoist Master, both fictional characters from the late sixteenth-century novel the Investiture of the Gods. Here, he rides a tiger and brandishes his iron cudgel. A pair of scissors, his magic weapon, floats underneath. The gold ingot held in his left hand indicates that he is also the god of wealth. The characterization of Zhao Gongming’s face, masklike in thick red, black, and white pigments, derives from the makeup conventions of Chinese opera. The predominant red color signals the character’s courage and righteousness."
Carpet,"Carpets woven in the former silk road settlements of Kashgar, Yarkand, and Khotan, situated at the western end of the Taklamakan Desert, display a mixture of patterns and styles. Chinese influence can be seen in the palette–with emphasis on deep red, blue, and yellow–and in some patterns, particularly those of the borders. Field patterns typically draw from Iranian or Central Asian Turkic or even Mughal Indian traditions. The knot type is the asymmetrical knot favored in Iran. This rug bears one of the more popular patterns found in these carpets, the vase and pomegranate design, here arranged in four units repeated to fill the large field."
Vase_with_gentlemen_in_a_landscape_(one_of_a_pair),"Early in the twentieth century, under the auspices of Yuan Shikai, some ceramics of surprisingly fine quality were produced at the Jingdezhen kilns of Jiangxi Province. Yuan had been named president of the Chinese Republic in 1912, and his ambitions to become emperor were realized in December 1915, when he ""accepted"" the throne. His reign was short-lived, however, as he died in June 1916.This pair of vases (with 68.4.2) have mirror-image designs that have been painted over the glaze in sepia and black pigments with minute attention to detail. They are marked on the base with Yuan Shikai's reign title, Hongxian, and they stand as proof of a degree of excellence in ceramic manufacture that is generally unexpected in wares of this period."
Buddha_Amitabha_Descending_from_his_Pure_Land,"This painting, traditionally ascribed by Japanese scholars to a Song Buddhist painter named Zhang Sigong, represents the Buddha Amitabha (J.: Amida) welcoming souls into his Western Paradise. The drapery of the robe is drawn in the ""scudding-cloud and running-water"" style, a drapery pattern the Chinese used to recall the Indian origin of the Buddha image.Infrared reflectography has revealed the following traces of an inscription in the lower left corner: ""Qingyuanfu, east of Washing Horse Bridge. . . ."" Since the name of the city of Ningbo was changed from Mingzhou to Qingyuanfu in 1195 and to Qingyuanlu in 1277, the painting may be dated to between 1195 and 1277. Stylistically, this work appears to date from the end of the twelfth or the beginning of the thirteenth century: the figure is extremely well drawn, with fine lines firmly describing the splendid face and hands of the image in a fully three-dimensional manner. An almost identical Buddha appears in one of the Daitokuji Five Hundred Luohans paintings, also made in Ningbo and dated 1178."
Snuff_Bottle,"Aventurine glass, which was made by dissolving copper particles into the molten glass, was invented by the Venetian glass makers of Murano. It was introduced to China during the Kangxi reign (1662–1722) and immediately caught the imagination of the Qing court. These prized bottles were made by the Imperial Workshop and given as gifts or rewards."
Snuff_bottles_with_figures_in_landscape,"Lacquer, the resin of a tree, has been colored with the mineral cinnabar and then layered onto the surface of this snuff bottle. It is the lacquer, not the underlying substructure, which was carved to create the scene of figures in a landscape."
Snuff_Bottle,"Painting inside snuff bottles was a novel development in the nineteenth century. With an angled bamboo pen, the artist worked through the narrow opening of a bottle’s mouth to paint pictures or write calligraphy on its interior walls."
Snuff_bottle_with_Buddhist_emblems,The parasol and flaming jewel carved deeply into the surface of this object are two of eight auspicious emblems introduced to China with Buddhism.
Snuff_bottle_in_the_shape_of_a_gourd,"A popular decorative motif, the gourd is synonymous of progeny, or multiple children, because the image of numerous gourds growing on a single vine is viewed as a symbol of many children in one family line."
Snuff_bottle_with_bird_on_a_branch,"Unglazed porcelain, also called biscuit porcelain, and high-relief decoration, were particularly popular during the late nineteenth century."
Furniture_Cover,"This furniture cover, probably for a seating platform (kang), is embroidered in the border and the field with a generally symmetrical scrolling floral pattern and a large number of tiny bats (a rebus for ""blessing""). The design is punctuated with auspicious Buddhist symbols."
Rank_Badge,"The bird shown on this badge is a crane, corresponding to the highest rank of civil official. The badge is woven in a fine silk tapestry weave (kesi) with some details, especially outlines, in metallic thread. The sun, at the upper right, was a Qing-dynasty innovation not found on Ming badges."
Panel_with_Geometric_Pattern,"This type of geometric pattern, supposedly derived from designs on ancient textiles, began to appear in the later Ming period (late 16th century). It continued to be elaborated and woven during the Qing dynasty."
Vase_with_archaic_motifs,"The interlaced designs, many ending in dragon’s heads, on the surface of this vase can be traced to decorations found on bronze vessels during the latter part of the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 B.C.)."
Water_Buffalo,"Ingeniously shaped out of a massive dark green nephrite boulder from the riverbed of Yarkand, in northwestern China, this sculpture weighs more than forty pounds. The cunning naturalistic details, including a whorl of hair on the animal’s forehead, demonstrate the observant eye of a master carver in the eighteenth century."
Boulder_with_the_eight_horses_of_King_Mu,"King Mu (r. 1001–947 B.C.) was an intrepid adventurer and is said to have traveled to the famous paradise of the immortals on Mount Kunlun as well as to other worldly and not–so–worldly sites. After his adventures, he released his eight favorite horses into a beautiful valley to finish their lives under the care of his charioteer."
Boulder_with_Daoist_paradise,"This impressive jade sculpture represents a Daoist paradise where immortals, cranes, and deer move through a mountainous landscape punctuated by pines, a waterfall, and a pavilion that stands beside a peach tree laden with fruit. Lower down the slope, a servant offers a platter of these ""peaches of immortality"" to two bearded figures. The otherworldly atmosphere is further enhanced by the meandering clouds that encircle the crest of the mountain. Jade, which is sonorous when struck but is harder than steel, has long been associated with moral virtue and immortality. The theme of reclusion within misty, fantastic realms appears in youxian (Wandering in Transcendence) poetry of the Six Dynasties period (220–589), and was a very popular painting subject beginning in the Tang dynasty (618–906)."
Water_vessel_in_the_shape_of_a_marriage_cup,"The marriage cup, which derives its name from the shape of two joined rhombuses, signifies the ideal union of two individuals. On one side of the cup are two small boys, one holding a ruyi scepter and the other wearing a vest decorated with coin shapes. Their companions on the other side hold a peach and a vase filled with coral. While the accessories in their hands stand for happiness, wealth, and longevity, the boys themselves allude to the proliferation of offspring as the hopeful result of a marriage."
Winged_Cup_with_Geometric_Designs,"By the Warring States period, Chu, noted for its lacquer production, was the major cultural force in south central China. The visual arts of Chu are often characterized as shamanistic in response to the prevalence of images of fairylike creatures riding on dragons, or clouds that change imperceptibly into dragons, and, as they meander through the sky, transform again into dragons. The playful, thin lines painted on this winged cup are a later stylized version of the traditional cloud-dragon motif. The two large winglike appendages on the cup are often described as ""ears"" in Chinese writings, and cups of this type, known from at least the eighth century B.C., are generally termed ""ear-cups,"" or erbei. It was most likely once part of a matched set of eating and drinking vessels."
Vase_with_gentlemen_in_a_landscape_(one_of_a_pair),"Early in the twentieth century, under the auspices of Yuan Shikai, some ceramics of surprisingly fine quality were produced at the Jingdezhen kilns of Jiangxi Province.

Eleven-headed_bodhisattva_Guanyin,"The central figure in this magnificent embroidery is eleven-headed Guanyin, one of many manifestations of the compassionate bodhisattva. The eleven heads symbolize steps on the path to enlightenment.This hanging illustrates the highest achievement of imperial Qing embroidery works of the eighteenth century. The embroidery features elaborate details. These include one thousand arms encircling Guanyin’s body with an eye in the center of the palm of each hand. An ink inscription on the object’s back panel indicates it was created in 1778 under the third Changkya Khutukhtu (1717–86), a Mongolian Tibetan Buddhist representative at the Qing court.Caption:Inscription on the back in Chinese, Manchurian, Tibetan, and Mongolian: “On the twenty-fourth day of the fourth month of the forty-third year ofQianlong reign [May 20, 1778] the Emperor [Qianlong] commanded the Changkya Khutukhtu to supervise this embroidery [of] eleven-headed Bodhisattva Guanyin.”"
Robe_of_State,"The robe of state, or chaofu, is the most formal of the imperial Qing robes, and was worn by the emperor and by his high officials during important annual rites. The slim-fitting sleeves and horse-hoof-shaped cuffs, which are vestiges of jackets for horseback hunting in cold weather, illustrate a Manchu adaptation of the traditional Han Chinese court dress, as does the shorter length of the garment. Such adaptations were formalized in 1759 when the style and decoration of court robes were standardized under regulations which also designated colors and designs for different types of robes. The dark blue color and four-clawed dragons on this robe indicate it would have been worn by an individual ranking somewhere between a third degree prince and a fourth degree official."
Letters,"明 諸家尺牘 五册 紙本Chinese calligraphy is more than just handwriting. From at least the second century, it was considered an outlet for personal expression, not just in the words one wrote, but also in the abstract forms of one’s brushwork. Correspondingly, it was believed that a sensitive viewer could read a man’s character through his calligraphy. Letters were seen as particularly revealing because they were private documents that encouraged the most unguarded type of personal expression. In reality, however, famous calligraphers knew that their letters might be collected as works of art, and they strove to write beautifully even in private correspondence.These letters are by men of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). They were preserved by collectors because of the fame of the writers, the beauty of the calligraphy, or both. Writing and reading letters were important daily activities in imperial China, where jobs were often located far away from friends and family. Many were written quickly and often for practical purposes, and they offer a glimpse inside the daily life of the scholar’s studio."
Mirror,"Though the surface design of this mirror is fantastically complex, its greatest significance is the inscription cast on its border:The sages made this mirror with the essence of the Five Elements. The images and designs are derived from the fundamental principles. Its brilliance is like the sun and moon, and its character firm and clear. When you see your face in the mirror, it dispels all harms and woes. May the Central Kingdom (i.e., China) be peaceful and secure, and prosper for generations and generations to come, by following the great law that governs all.These lines express explicitly the spirit of the age, when people from all parts of the empire began to identify themselves as Chinese, and China as their common homeland"
Woman's_Sleeveless_Jacket_with_Butterflies,"Tapestry-woven (kesi) silk and metallic thread Emblematic of summer and joy, butterflies have long inspired Chinese writers, artists, and even philosophers. For example, the Zhuangzi, a book of Daoist thought (ca. 300 A.D.), contains a story in which the purported author, Zhuangzi dreams he is a butterfly. By the late Tang dynasty, a story of ""butterfly lovers"" appeared in which a young couple, tragically thwarted in their wishes to wed, turn into a pair of butterflies and flutter away.The delicate tapestry-woven (kesi) butterflies seen on the green background of this sleeveless jacket also occur on the black background of its border. Beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century, the borders at the edges of garments became increasingly elaborate."
Daoist_priest’s_robe,"This is a formal outfit for Daoist ceremonies, embroidered with a variety of animals that have religious significance. On top of the large roundel containing a pagoda are a red sun with a gold crow on the left and a white moon with a jade rabbit on the right. White cranes, symbols of immortality, are embroidered all over the robe. Along the bottom border is a mixture of different mythical animals, including blue and red dragons, unicorns, dragonfish, and a tortoise entwined with a snake (xuanwu), a mythical creature that symbolizes the north in the Chinese cosmic system.Front of the robe. The two panels along its collar are embroidered with the blue dragon (symbol of the east) and the white tiger (symbol of the west)."
"The_Deity_Vajrabhairava,_Tantric_Form_of_the_Bodhisattva_Manjushri","The most popular tantric manifestation of Manjushri is Vajrabhairava. Here, he has a buffalo head, holds an array of weapons, and tramples on birds, dogs, and Hindu gods. In this form, he is sometimes called Yamantaka, or the defeater of death, a deity that ends the cycle of rebirth and provides a path to nirvana. He frightens away egotism and selfishness—the root of suffering—and in this true form reveals the awesome and terrifying nature of enlightenment. For this extraordinary embroidery, the artist employed fine silk floss to achieve brilliant gradations of color and used horsehair underneath to create three-dimensional effects. The work was likely part of a group given by the Yongle-period emperor Chengzu to a Tibetan monk who conducted Vajrayana rituals in the Chinese court in 1415–16."
Portrait_of_Shaoyu_in_the_guise_of_Liu_Ling,"This is an example of a type of portrait that became popular in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in which the sitter plays the role of a famous historical or legendary figure. Here, the subject, identified only by his sobriquet, Shaoyu, appears in the guise of the drunken scholar Liu Ling (221–300), who turned to wine to escape the tumultuous political environment of his day. Liu is remembered as one of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, contemporaries who renounced worldly affairs for the simple pleasures of drink, music, and poetry. Following standard depictions of Liu, Shaoyu rides in a deer-drawn carriage and is accompanied by attendants, one of whom carries a spade to bury the master on the spot should he die from dissipation."
"Vase_decorated_with_flowers,_birds,_and_poems","The precise date for the vase is found in the poems and seals that are part of the decoration. One of the poems discusses peonies, particularly those on the mythical mountain Penglai, while the other alludes to the strength and brightness of chrysanthemums. The seal, which appears twice, is that of the “residence of wood and stone” (mu shi ju), the name of an independent kiln or studio at Jingdezhen."
Belt_hook_with_dragons,"Belt hooks, possibly inspired by nomadic cultures of the steppes, were not merely a practical garment fastener but also an important means of asserting social standing. The masterly cast, intertwined dragons and luxurious gilding of this accessory communicate the prominent status of the owner."
One_Hundred_Horses,"During the eighteenth century, the Manchu Qing dynasty sponsored a major revival of courtly arts, which attained a new monumental scale, technical finish, and descriptive intricacy. A key figure in establishing this new court aesthetic was the Italian Jesuit Giuseppe Castiglione. A master of vividly naturalistic draftsmanship and large-scale compositions, in Europe he worked as a muralist. Castiglione helped to create a new, hybrid style that combined Western realism with traditional Chinese conventions of composition and brushwork.This monumental scroll, a unique example of a Castiglione preparatory drawing, is the model for one of Castiglione's most famous paintings, the One Hundred Horses scroll preserved in the National Palace Museum, Taipei. The drawing, although done with a brush rather than a pen, is executed almost exclusively in the European manner. Landscape is represented using Western-style perspective, figures are often shown in dramatically foreshortened views, and vegetation is depicted with spontaneous arabesques and cross-hatching. The large scale of the painting also suggests a European influence, as if Castiglione had taken a typical Western canvas and extended its length to make an architectural frieze."
Strange_Pine_in_the_Yellow_Mountain,"This fan depicts Yellow Mountain (Huangshan), a famous scenic spot in Anhui Province that Zhang knew firsthand as well as through the paintings of such seventeenth-century Anhui masters as Mei Qing (1623–1697), whom he imitates here. Zhang painted this fan at the Master of the Fishing Nets Garden in Suzhou—his studio was located in the courtyard that later served as the model for the Astor Garden Court—where he resided for a time with his better-known younger brother, Zhang Daqian (1899–1983), and his pet tiger. The artist's poetic inscription reads:The strange pines painted by the Mei family are unsurpassed,Father and son sit together practicing their brushwork in the sand.For a thousand ages Yellow Mountain's beautiful colors have been marvelous; How many people have been moved by its magical rosy clouds?(Robert Hatfield Ellsworth et al., trans., Later Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 1800-1950, 3 vols. [New York: Random House, 1987], vol. 1, p. 138)"
Gazing_at_a_waterfall,"Zhang Shiyuan was a historically oriented painter who worked in Shanghai through the Republic period and into the early years of the People’s Republic of China. The layers of darting lines and boisterous dots that texture the hills of this scene were inspired by the seventeenth-century painter Shitao (1642–1707), a favorite in Shanghai painting circles in Zhang’s day. In a tall pavilion partially hidden by a rocky outcropping, two gentlemen commune over their shared admiration for the dramatic scenery."
Ritual_tripod_cauldron_(Ding),"Linked to power and dominion over the land, the ding is one of the most important ritual vessel types. They were used to cook and serve food offerings. Similar to other ritual bronze vessels, ding were originally made as ceramics, then were cast in bronze in the Shang dynasty. In the later periods, ding were produced in ceramics and metalwork not only as ritual vessels but also to serve as incense burners."
Sea_and_Sky_at_Sunrise,"This fanciful painting bears a suite of false inscriptions and seals, including a fake signature of the twelfth-century court painter Zhao Boju. Zhao was famous for his blue-green landscapes, and many paintings bearing his name were produced in later centuries, some intended to fool collectors and others as charming reproductions. This painting, likely made in the seventeenth century, belongs to the latter category. The intense palette of azurite blue and malachite green, and the scalloped clouds that cling to the mountains, signals a magical, mysterious place that is difficult to access and inhabited by supernatural beings."
Deer_by_a_Pine_Stream,"The auspicious objects, animals, and flowers found in the imperial garden were often the subject of court paintings. In this miniature picture, a male deer and a female deer stand by a stream from which auspicious clouds emanate. The image seems to convey the message that in this cultivated, peaceful, and humane era, the nation is as idyllic as an imperial park. No doubt the painting functioned as part of a systematic program of imperial art designed to create a symbolic visualization of a cultivated emperor's reign."
Letter,"In this letter, Song Jue mentions his friend Cheng Jiasui, another painter working in the Songjiang region, who apparently made a painting for the letter’s recipient. Song goes on to say that he is looking forward to showing off his newborn son and asks for some fine silks to have clothes made for the boy."
Letter,Song Jue wrote this brief letter in boisterous cursive script to his friend Li Juxiu to express his wish to get together with their mutual friend Cheng Jiasui. Cheng and Song were both prominent scholar-painters active in Songjiang (present-day Shanghai).
Yong_Zin_Khon_Shogpel:_Seventh_Abbot_of_Ngor_Monastary,"This painting is one of two in The Met collection from a set depicting the abbots of Ngor monastery, which follows the teachings of the Sakya school. Tibetan Buddhism assigns exceptional prestige and reverence to abbots, who were seen as empowered to transmit the pure teachings of the Buddha; on occasions the most revered were accepted as the living embodiments of enlightenment. Founded in 1429, Ngor monastery quickly became a center of excellence for painting, initially produced under the direction of Nepalese master artists. By the sixteenth century, influences from Chinese painting began appearing, as seen here in the treatment of the throne and drapery. In the upper and framing registers is the Sakya order lineage, and in the lower register are protective and auspicious deities."
Monastic_Dance_Robe,"Ritual dances (cham) featuring music have always been an important part of Tibetan Buddhist practice. Stag dances are especially popular during the end-of-year Gu Tor Festival. These performances, dedicated to fierce deities, siphon malignant forces into a torma (a sculpted offering often made of butter and flour). A monk dressed as a stag cuts the torma into pieces, scattering them as he dances to rid the community of hostile forces. The large audiences that attended these dances had to see the stag costumes from afar, so they are deliberately exaggerated—the large eyes and antlers of this mask give the dancer greater stature. The elaborate Chinese silk robe, showing a dragon cavorting among clouds and waves, was likely a gift to a Tibetan monastery."

"Vase_with_decoration_of_rocks,_flowers,_and_butterflies","The decorating of porcelain with lacquer and mother-of-pearl exemplifies the inventiveness of Chinese art from the mid-seventeenth to the early eighteenth century. Although the vase is not marked, the shape is common among works produced during the reign of the Kangxi emperor. However, it is not clear if the lacquer and pearl shell were added when the vase was made or slightly later. Vases with this type of decoration are found in some numbers in Europe, where they are often known as laques burgautés,a term that was coined by nineteenth-century French specialists in porcelain and that is frequently, and incorrectly, used to describe works in lacquer with mother-of-pearl decoration."
Belt_Plaque_in_the_Shape_of_a_Crouching_Horse,"Intriguing metal artifacts such as this silver plaque and scattered references in Chinese and Western histories are our only sources of information about the numerous pastoral, seminomadic, and horse-riding tribes that inhabited the vast reaches of Central Asia traversed by the Silk Road.Most likely used as an adornment on a bridle or other equine accoutrement, this small plaque illustrates the dissemination of artistic motifs across Asia. The beaklike shape of the horse's muzzle, the dramatic twist of its hindquarters, and the lively openwork frame all reflect an imagery and stylistic approach found in objects made earlier by Indo-European Scythian peoples living on the Iranian plateau and in the area around the Black Sea. Comparable motifs appear in tattoos on the body from tomb 2 at Pazyryk, in the Altai mountains of southern Siberia. Eight of the twenty-five burial mounds (kurgan) at that site, currently dated between the late fourth and early third century B.C., have yielded textiles and metalwork from West and Central Asia as well as silk, lacquer, and metalwork from China.This plaque was cast in silver and has remnants of gilding on its surface. It was probably made in North China for a member of the Yuezhi or one of the other confederacies in Central Asia that maintained an active trade with various Chinese centers, exchanging furs and carpets for commodities such as grain and luxuries such as silk or metalwork."
Pair_of_Square_Seals_with_Cloud_and_Rock_Pattern,"Seal carving became an important branch of Chinese literati art during the late sixteenth century, when artists began using soft stones, or soapstones, for the craft. A variety of soapstones, particularly those from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces on China's southeastern coast, quickly became the preferred material, chosen for their fine texture, attractive colors, subtle luster, sensuous feel, and jadelike translucence. These stones have since been held in the highest esteem by artists and collectors alike. As the extensive exploitation in the last few centuries has practically exhausted their sources, they are now in extremely limited supply.This pair of seals, each a square prism with a gently curving top, are made of duchengkang stone, which is named after the site of its occurrence in Fujian Province and celebrated for its mellow amber color and fine grain. On their smoothly polished surface, clouds and rocks, common decorative motifs on the sides of seals, are skillfully and fluidly carved in low relief."
Fragment_of_a_manuscript_of_the_Sutra_of_Accumulated_Treasures_(Dabaoji_jing),"This fragmentary scripture encapsulates the grace of Tang-dynasty “sutra script,” the formal hand used for copying scriptures. Regular spacing within characters and columns imparts a stately quality; fluidity of line and the occasional looping flourishes inject sumptuous elegance."
Dish_with_warrior,"The dramatic warrior with two axes depicted in the center of this plate illustrates the addition of figures based on popular plays and novels to the repertory of kraak ware, a type of ceramic that was often exported to Europe. This warrior, who cannot be precisely identified, holds axe in his lowered right hand, with a second one in his belt, and may be allusion to Li Gui (also known as the Black Whirlwind), one of the heroes of the classic Ming novel The Water Margin (Shui Hu Zhuan). The composite groupings of flowers on the panel, on the other hand, reflect the impact of contemporaneous Turkish Iznik wares on the evolution of kraak ware in the early seventeenth century while some of the single blossoms represent tulips, a flower that was first cultivated in Turkey, and eventually spread to Holland as part of the development of global trade, including Chinese porcelains, in the late sixteenth and seventeenth century."
The_Civil_Official_Door_Guards_“Five_Great_Fortunes”_and_“Longevity”,"While images of military figures guard doors that face onto the street, those of civil officials with benign faces and quiet dignity are placed on inner doors. This pair of door guards wears robes decorated with a crane, emblematic of the highest rank in the civil service system. On the tray held by the right-hand official stands a deer (lu), which is homophonic with the Chinese character for “emoluments.” On the tray in the left-hand print is a qilin, a legendary animal that carries a variety of felicitous associations. In the clouds issuing from the animals’ mouths are five red bats (wu hong fu), a rebus for the “five great fortunes:” longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue, and a peaceful death."
Horsemanship_Competition_for_the_Shunzhi_Emperor,"This long handscroll documents one of the celebratory events accompanying the entrance of the Shunzhi emperor (r. 1644–61) into Beijing shortly after the fall of the Ming dynasty to the Manchus. Painted by a Manchu artist, it is among the earliest examples of Qing courtly painting known and suggests the unsophisticated nature of Manchu art prior to the sinicization of the court under the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662–1722). The scroll is not only of great historical interest but also serves as a striking foil to The Kangxi Emperor's Southern Inspection Tour (acc. no. 1979.5) of about 1697, which reflects the impact of mainstream Chinese culture on court patronage.The painting which is probably a preparatory sketch, presents a file of horsemen each performing a different riding stunt (below). At the right end two rows of imperial bodyguards flank two horsemen who are about to perform. Five men blow conches to announce the next rider, while two officers, one identified by a peacock feather in his cap, direct. Each rider was originally accompanied by two label strips naming his pose and military unit. All of the horsemen belong to one of the three highest-ranking of the eight ""banners"" that divided the Manchu army."
"Mandala_of_Vajradhara,_Manjushri_and_Sadakshari_-Lokeshvara","The Tibetan branch of Esoteric Buddhism, introduced into China during the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1279–1368), continued to be patronized by early Ming dynasty emperors. Throughout the fifteenth century, a significant community of Tibetan lamas remained active in Beijing, the site of the former Mongol capital city, Dadu, and after 1402 the principal Ming capital.This mandala, or cosmic diagram used in meditation, is painted in rich colors on a coarse cloth ground in the Tibetan manner, but the presence of a Chinese dedication along the lower margin as well as a number of distinctive stylistic features suggest that it was the product of an atelier in China that created images based on Tibetan prototypes. Stylistically, the mandala is related to three others, dated between 1477 and 1479, which are now in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.The iconography of this mandala consists of three main deities, the Buddha Vajradhara (above), together with Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom (lower right), and Shadakshari-Lokeshvara, a manifestation of Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion (lower left), set within a field of thirty-nine subsidiary deities. Each deity is seated on a lotus throne and framed by an ornately figured halo. Vajradhara, who grasps two vajras or thunderbolts, is further distinguished by an encircling array of the twelve auspicious Buddhist symbols."
Fan_Case_with_Flowers_and_Insects_on_a_White_Background,"Shown here is an embroidered fan case—an accessory worn at the waist for holding folding fans when they were not in use. The case with a white ground was originally acquired in Beijing by Louis de Geofroy, French ambassador to China in the 1850s. It features an unusual technique—raised-work embroidery, which produces a three-dimensional effect (note the insect motifs)."
Chair_Strip_with_Flowers_and_Decorative_Rocks,"The length of this chair strip is divided into segments, with a different floral design for each part of the chair being covered-the front legs, seat, and back, and a short segment that hangs behind the chair. Tree peonies dominate the floral designs, and some segments are actually miniature garden scenes, with decorative, perforated garden rocks and butterflies.In the term for the textile's structure (""cut and voided velvet""), ""cut"" refers to the fact that, as in most velvets we use today, the pile loops have been cut; ""voided"" refers to areas without pile, where the pile warps were not raised onto velvet rods at all but were instead allowed to remain concealed in the background. In this piece, the pattern appears in cut pile, and the background and details of the pattern, such as the veins of leaves, are voided."
Woven_Panel_with_Swallows_and_Prunus,"This piece, woven in gold threads and polychrome silks is unnusually well preserved and retains, to a large degree, its original brilliant appearance."
Fan_Case_with_Flowers_and_Insects_on_a_Brown_Background,"Shown here is an embroidered fan case—an accessory worn at the waist for holding folding fans when they were not in use. It features an unusual technique—raised-work embroidery, which produces a three-dimensional effect (note the insect motifs)."
Chair_Strip_with_Dragons,"On this rare example of a Ming chair strip, two powerful dragons, one in the sky and the other in the sea, embody cosmic forces of nature. The upper dragon decorates the portion that would have covered the chair’s back, and the lower dragon covers the part that would have hung below the seat in front of the chair’s front legs."
Panel_with_Lantern_and_Streamers,"Perhaps used on the occasion of the Lantern Festival—the fifteenth day of the first lunar month—this tapestry illustrates the seasonal interior design of a wealthy family in the seventeenth century. Celebrated with numerous lanterns lighting up the streets and buildings, this traditional festival extends the auspicious wishes of brightness and joy for the first full moon of the lunar New Year."
Woman's_Informal_Robe_with_Pattern_of_Begonias,"The begonia pattern of this informal robe was woven in subtle shades of gray on a bright yellow ground. The piece still possesses its original sleeve, neck, and hem bands, which also feature a begonia pattern in shades of gray but on a dark gray ground."
Furniture_Cover_with_Pattern_of_Flowers_and_Sonorous_Stones,"This embroidered textile may have served as a table covering. At the center of the piece is a large, round, full-face flower surrounded by four flowers in profile with scrolling stems that sit in a geometric field. That field, in turn, has a wide border that repeats the theme of large flowers in profile and scrolling stems. Four sonorous stones and clusters of small, red nandina berries are also found in the border.As with the needlepoint embroidery practiced today, the embroidery stitches of this textile completely cover the foundation cloth, a yellow silk gauze."
"Plaque_with_dragon,_pheasant,_quail,_and_other_birds_amidst_bamboo_and_plum_blossom","This large two-sided plaque showcases the skill of ivory carvers in the eighteenth century. Four powerful dragons crawl along the edges, and a host of plants, flowers, and birds (including pheasants and quails) are beautifully carved on one side. The depth of the carving—the flowers and birds are nearly three-dimensional—is typical of the eighteenth century, as is the use of ink to enhance select elements. A scene showing figures performing everyday activities in a landscape is incised into the other side of the plaque, which also has a six-character mark that indicates that the plaque was inspired by works produced during the reign of the Qianlong emperor."
Rank_Badge_with_Qilin,The qilin is a fantastic animal shown here in its conventional form. The flames shooting from the creature's body signify its supernatural powers. After 1662 the qilin became the insignia of military officials of the first rank; before that time it was worn by nobles.
Collar_in_the_Shape_of_Two_Butterflies,"Fancifully shaped collars were often worn by children. This embroidered example, probably worn by a young girl, is in the shape of two butterflies."
Chair_Strip_with_Antiquities,"Unlike upholstered furniture, chairs in China were covered only temporarily with textiles such as this chair strip, designed and embroidered specifically to be used as a chair covering. The antiquities in the design are rebuses for good wishes. For example, the halberd and the angled stone chime together form the rebus for ""celebratory occasion."" This strip is embroidered mainly with gold threads that have been couched-that is, laid on the surface of the satin and stitched into place."
Case_with_Cover,"This flat case in the shape of two pomegranates has a cover shaped like two leaves. Pomegranates, with their copious seeds, represent a wish for many descendants."
Purse_with_Cover,"The paired fish embroidered on this small purse are said to symbolize harmony, and the purse’s cover is in the shape of a stone chime—a rebus for “celebration.”"
Gourd-Shaped_Case_with_Pattern_of_Pig-Faced_Creature,"The imagery on this bag is taken from the Xiyou ji (The Journey to the West), a Ming-dynasty (1368–1644) text based on the historical pilgrimage of the Buddhist monk Xuanzang (596–664) from China to India for the purpose of bringing back Buddhist scriptures. The boldly rendered, pig-faced creature is Zhu Bajie, one of Xuanzang’s supernatural animal companions, shown here with the rake he uses as a weapon."
"Table_Valance_with_Theme_of_the_""Hundred_Antiques""","A rich array of vessels and objects in many media—such as bronze, ceramic, and carved rhinoceros horn—are depicted on this valance, which was likely meant for the front of a large table.The bronzes, especially the tall ceremonial wine vessel (gu), seen at the center of the middle group of objects on the lower panel, and the square four-legged ceremonial food vessel (fang ding) at the left, feature a na?ve rendition of the mask decoration on archaic bronzes (which can be seen in the Galleries for the Arts of Ancient China downstairs).Ceramics are scattered throughout the valance: one at the lower left features a crackled glaze, a highly desirable effect among late Ming connoisseurs. The craft of carved rhinoceros horn is represented by the flaring cup seen at the lower right."
Folding_Case_with_Characters_for_Longevity_(Shou_and_Kao),"This case is decorated with the characters shou kao, meaning longevity, on a fretwork ground that incorporates the swastika, or wan, signifying ten thousand years."
Bag_with_Character_for_Longevity_(Shou),"This case is decorated with the character shou, meaning longevity, on a fretwork ground that incorporates the swastika, or wan, signifying ten thousand years."
Panel_with_Dragon,"This fragment of a larger embroidered textile utilizes polychrome silks and two other types of thread. Gold metallic thread is especially prominent in the background, and thread made from peacock feathers wrapped around a silk core is seen in the scales of the dragon."
Rank_Badge_with_Lion,"During the Ming dynasty, the audience robes of government officials bore insignia designating rank. While different birds represented civil ranks, military ranks were represented by a variety of real and mythical quadrupeds. The lion, as seen on this badge, symbolizes the highest military rank."
Rank_Badge_with_Mandarin_Duck,"The mandarin duck corresponds to the seventh civil rank. The birds on rank badges referred to actual species but did not necessarily reflect nature; they were represented in ways that became conventional but were not always consistent. Here, for example, the mandarin duck's feet are not webbed, while the mandarin duck in the badge exhibited next to this one has webbed feet."
Rank_Badge_with_Egret,"The egret corresponds to the sixth civil rank. Tapestry-woven (kesi) in colorful silk with gold thread for the background, this rank badge shows the egret surrounded with waves, rocks, clouds, bats, and flowering plants, including a peach tree, connoting longevity. Below the waves is a stylized water pattern (li shui), which first began to appear on rank badges in the eighteenth century."
Rank_Badge_with_Mallow_Flower,"The mallow flower on this badge was the insignia of civil officials in the Sacred Music Department of the Qing government who performed slow rhythmic dances at court rituals. This type of badge appears in the Huang chao li qi tu shi, an illustrated set of imperial regulations from 1759."
Formal_Collar,"Formal portraits of Qing-dynasty men and women—members of the imperial family, the nobility, and court officials—show them wearing this type of detachable collar (pi ling) over their formal court robes."
Panel,Satin damask was a popular fabric during the Ming period. the stylized lotus scroll pattern is typical of late Ming design.
Textile_with_the_Character_for_Longevity_(Shou),"The character for longevity (shou) is here flanked by beribboned swastikas (wan), each signifying ten thousand years. The shape of the textile suggests that it may have been part of a decorative canopy or valance."
Textile_with_Floral_Scroll,"This textile is said to have been found in the tomb of Prince Guo (1697–1738), the seventeenth son of the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662–1722). The centers of the flowers are brocaded in gold thread-strips of gilded paper wrapped around a silk core—for an opulent effect."
Rank_Badge_with_Peacock,"The peacock insignia was worn by Qing-dynasty civil officials of the third rank. Originally, this sumptuous badge appears to have had a split down the center, suggesting that it was for the front of an official's surcoat, which would have opened down the middle. Rank badges for the back of the surcoat have no such split.Fittingly, peacock-feather thread, now very worn, was used in the embroidery of the peacock's tail and also for the perforated rock in the waves below."
Women_and_children_in_a_garden,"Women and children gather in an elegant garden setting surrounded by a lotus pond in full blossom. The opening scene centers on a pair of women playing the board game weiqi in a waterside pavilion. Toward the end of the scroll, a second vignette shows a woman readying to play a zither prepared by her attendant. Weiqi and music are two of the “four perfections,” a set of abilities considered de rigeur for the scholarly elite. Presumably, the scroll once contained vignettes featuring the other two—calligraphy and painting—that have been lost."
Streamer,"This streamer is part of a matching set of four in the Museum’s collection that were probably once a part of a woman’s skirt. Although usually such streamers simply come to a point at the bottom, these examples are shaped like large butterflies. On the butterfly’s back is the longevity symbol, wan, signifying ten thousand years."
Panels_with_Scrolling_Floral_Design,"These floral panels came from a pair of chair covers, probably from the segment that covered the back of the chair. The two panels are not identical: seen side by side, they exhibit the elegant mirror-imaging that is typical of pairs of chair strips."
Sutra_Cover_with_Floral_Pattern,Sutra cover with repeating floral pattern; light blue. Silk satin damask.
Sutra_Cover_with_Lingzhi_Fungus_and_Diagonal_Cloud_Bands,Sutra cover with repeating pattern of lingzhi fungus and diagonal cloud bands; gold metallic thread on a red background. Silk satin with supplementary-weft patterning in metallic thread.
Set_of_Seven_Boxes,"These feather-light boxes have thin cores coated with a fine putty and lacquer. A pattern of small painted spirals and curls and silver quatrefoils decorates the exterior. The set of boxes, each shaped differently, was originally organized inside a large, round cosmetic box and was probably produced in the southeastern coastal region."
Sutra_Cover_with_Clouds_and_Auspicious_Symbols,Sutra cover with repeating pattern of clouds and auspicious patterns; gold metallic thread on a green background. Silk satin with supplementary-weft patterning in metallic thread.
Woman’s_Robe_with_Lotus_Flowers,The lightweight gauze foundation cloth and the pattern of lotus flowers with butterflies indicate that this robe was meant to be worn in summer.
Roundel_with_Four-Clawed_Dragon_(Mang),"A distinction was drawn between the five-clawed dragon (long) and the four-clawed dragon (mang), which represented lower ranks. The striped water pattern seen here at the bottom center of the roundel developed during the Qing dynasty."
Textile_with_Horned_Animals_in_a_Pearl_Roundel,"This piece, showing two confronted animals, likely bulls, is a composite of roundels from different parts of the same length of cloth. This category of textile moved with Sogdian merchants along overland trade routes that linked Central Asia with territories farther west. The tradition of setting animals in pearl roundels has its origins in the late Sasanian period and remained popular in Central Asia for many centuries."
Back_and_Sleeve_of_a_Dragon_Robe,"The pieces assembled in this panel are parts of a dragon robe or coat made for the Lantern Festival, which takes place on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month-the first full moon of the year. The panel, which has a wide border of silk woven in the eighteenth century, includes the back and one sleeve of a dragon robe with a pattern of a composite lantern framed on three sides by dragons."
Fan_Case_with_Orchids_and_Lotus,"This fan case has two different tapestry-woven patterns. One side, suitable for summer, depicts a lotus; the other, more appropriate for autumn, features orchids."

Three_Cases_from_a_Set,"These three cases are embroidered with bats, flowers, and some of the attributes of the Eight Daoist Immortals, such as the fan and the sword. The cylindrical case was used to hold a ring; the rectangular case, cards; and the case with a round opening, a watch."

Daoist_immortal_Li_Tieguai_receiving_a_visitor,"Legend states that the Daoist immortal Li Tieguai assumed his disheveled form accidentally. One of the master’s abilities was to send his spirit on journeys while his body lay dormant. On one of these occasions, Li was gone for so long that his assistant mistook the master for dead and cremated him. Returning to find his body missing, Li appropriated the body of a local mendicant who walked with an iron crutch, and was thereafter known as Li Tieguai (Iron-Crutch Li). Beloved for his wild appearance and spiritual abilities, Li was frequently depicted in popular culture; here, he addresses a formally dressed official who has come to pay respects."
Bamboo,"Bamboo painting has remained popular through the twentieth century and into the present day. Wu Huayuan made this fan in 1942, amid World War II, in response to a painting by the Ming dynasty artist Xia Chang."
The_Diamond_Sutra,"By the late Ming dynasty, when this copy of the Diamond Sutra was produced, most Buddhist scriptures were printed rather than written by hand. This unusual sutra features handwritten red text and hand-painted color illustrations mixed with woodblock-printed sections of text."
Luohans,"The Buddha achieved enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, India, in the fifth century BC, beneath a tree with large, spade-shaped leaves. This tree, a type of ficus, became revered by Buddhists as the sacred Tree of Enlightenment (bodhi tree) and was propagated by believers throughout Asia. In China, painters used leaves of the bodhi tree to create albums like this, which invest the ground of the image with an extra layer of sacred power by connecting it to the Buddha’s awakening. With bright, thickly applied mineral pigments, this album shows the luohans exercising their magical powers."
Paintings_for_Monk_Xuesheng,"Albums made it possible to gather together paintings by different artists into a single work. These six leaves come from an album dedicated to an obscure Buddhist monk named Xuesheng that includes painting and calligraphy by several artists who were active in Nanjing during the mid-seventeenth century. Each painting, inscribed with a dedication to Xuesheng, has been paired with a calligraphic inscription by another artist. This type of album, a significant effort to put together, might have been commissioned by Xuesheng himself, or perhaps by a friend to present as a gift."
Ritual_Wine_Beaker_(Gu),"This elaborate set of wine vessels provides an idea of the splendor of Shang and early Zhou ritual ceremonies. The set is said to have come from a tomb uncovered in 1901; shortly thereafter, it entered the collection of Duan Fang, a senior Manchu official and one of the preeminent antiquarians of the late Qing period.The pieces vary in style and execution. Although eleven of the vessels are inscribed, only one grouping shares identical inscriptions: the two wine containers, or you (nos. 2, 3) and the tall wine container, or zun (no. 4). A second grouping has largely comparable inscriptions: the spouted water vessel, or he (no. 5) and one cup, or zhi (no. 11).A partial reconstruction of the set’s arrangement in the tomb may be established from corrosion outlines on the three principal vessels—the two wine containers, or you, and the central tall wine container, or zun—that were etched onto the surface of the altar table. The diagram shows a hypothetical arrangement of the remaining vessels around the major pieces. Even if this is accepted as the original grouping, the disparate inscriptions and vessel styles remain unexplained. Created around the time of the Zhou conquest of the Shang, and clearly by different foundries, the pieces of the set may represent the accumulated wealth of a family shrine.青銅禁1.

Bottle_with_Coiling_Dragon,"Archaeological evidence indicates that the kilns near Dehua in Fujian Province on China’s southeastern coast opened in the late thirteenth century and flourished from the sixteenth to the eighteenth. Characterized by thick, lustrous glazes, Dehua wares, both religious figures and items for use on a scholar’s desk, were exported to Europe in the seventeenth to nineteenth century. They are often known in Western writings by the French term blanc de chine, or “China white,” which originated in nineteenth-century scholarship."

Ritual_wine_container_(zun),"This elaborate set of wine vessels provides an idea of the splendor of Shang and early Zhou ritual ceremonies. The set is said to have come from a tomb uncovered in 1901; shortly thereafter, it entered the collection of Duan Fang, a senior Manchu official and one of the preeminent antiquarians of the late Qing period.The pieces vary in style and execution.

Chair_Strip_with_Antiquities,"The length of this chair strip is divided into segments, with a different design for each part of the chair being covered-the front legs, seat, and back, and a short segment that hangs behind the chair. The theme of the ""hundred antiques,"" embroidered onto the dark blue satin, is especially finely executed on the segment that would cover the back of the chair. There, ritual bronzes flank a tall vase containing tree peonies. Auspicious birds are mixed in with the still-life elements: a mandarin duck stands on one foot on a rock next to the tall vase, and at the top of the chair strip, upside down because it would have hung behind the chair, a crane stands in a vessel containing waves. Both these birds have favorable associations, the mandarin duck with conjugal harmony and the crane with long life, and both are insignia of rank for governmental officials."

Seated_luohan_holding_a_rosary,"This ceramic sculpture presents a luohan as an elderly monk with a deeply creased forehead. With nearly closed eyes, the luohan clasps a rosary in his hands, probably as he meditates or chants the words of a scripture."
Panel_with_dragon,"The powerful dragon on this panel illustrates the extraordinary weaving of the imperial workshops of the Qing dynasty. Woven in gold threads of two types, the dragon features a shining face and scales that contrast with its matte tongue, mane, and claw tips. In the complicated system of laws governing the use of imperial symbols during the Qing dynasty, four-clawed dragons (known as mang) were reserved for use by certain members of the imperial family."
Valance,"This table valance's main pattern, the frontal view of a four-clawed dragon (mang) with clouds, waves, and mountains, is paired with an upper panel that features a book and some vessels, one of them a ceramic with a crackled glaze. They appear with two angled musical stones that flank a lantern, symbolizing the imminence of a happy event."
Magpies_and_Prunus,"In China magpies are seen as messengers of joy and are often shown in pairs, while “prunus” is homophonic with the character for “eyebrows.” Together the two motifs form a rebus on the set phrase “Joy up to one’s eyebrows,” which has been inscribed in the upper left corner by the artist Ding Liangxian."
Velvet_Textile_for_a_Dragon_Robe,"This rare piece illustrates the early stage of the design of dragon robes during the Qing dynasty. The size of the dragon in comparison to that of the robe, as well as its power and ferociousness, continues the design style of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644)."
One_hundred_portraits_of_Peking_opera_characters,"In the opera boom of the late nineteenth century, albums were turned to a new purpose: documenting the variety and vibrancy of stage culture in all its multicolored splendor. This album records in detail the makeup and costume of one hundred characters drawn from nine plays. Each character is identified with an accompanying inscription, and the plays are named at the top right of nine of the leaves in slightly larger script."
Seated_bodhisattva,"This elegant bodhisattva wears a particularly elaborate array of fine beaded chains and pendants on his chest and skirt. The object is part of a series of large Buddhist porcelain sculptures bejeweled with applied ropes of pearl beading, which relates them to a popular trend of decoration in the early fourteenth century."
Bottle_with_Dragons,"In the eighteenth century, the kilns at Jingdezhen began to make porcelains of a different material. Known as huashi, or ""slippery stone,"" this expensive material, often called soft paste, was used to make thin vessels that frequently were decorated with incised or raised designs under glaze. While the reasons for its introduction remain unclear, soft paste is easily carvable, and its use would have thus been akin to contemporaneous interests in the manipulation of other materials such as ivory and bamboo."
Dish_with_three_heroes_from_Water_Margin,"Cartouches at these figures’ hips name them as heroes from the classic novel Water Margin (Shuihu Zhuan), which recounts the resistance of a gang of outlaws to the corrupt Song government in the early twelfth century. First published in the mid-sixteenth century, the novel was popular and remained so through the modern period. Figures and scenes from the novel became important sources in the art of the Ming and Qing dynasties."
Reading_a_sutra_by_moonlight,"Chan/Zen art and philosophy blend strict rigor with playful irreverence. The dignified image of an aging master learnedly poring over an abstruse scripture is undercut by the poetic inscription, which suggests that true enlightenment may just as well be found elsewhere:In this volume of scripture,The words have no clear meaning.The sun rises, the moon sets,When will I finish reading it?—Translation after Wen C. Fong"
Dish_with_scene_of_a_woman_and_children,Qing-dynasty porcelains painted with overglaze enamels are often catalogued and dated according to the colors of their palettes using a system first devised in the nineteenth century by a French scholar. Porcelains painted in shades of pink are fittingly known as famille rose. In this dish—whose subject is the popular theme of a woman and children surrounded by luxuries—pink is used for the children's clothing and in one of the borders that frames the charming scene.
Bodhisattva_Guanyin,"Downcast eyes and clasped hands impart a serene quality to this intimately scaled Guanyin. A dated inscription on silk found in the sculpture’s interior reveals that it was commissioned in 1624 by a devotee named Wang Shichun and his wife, surnamed Li. Like many in premodern China, they turned to Guanyin for help; this sculpture allowed them to venerate the bodhisattva daily, in their home."
Court_Robe,"This Chinese court robe is approximately the same age as the one used to make the Japanese kesa displayed here, and both are made of brocaded satin. Eight dragons, four seen full-face and four in profile, are visible when the robe is worn. The frontal dragons are on the chest, the upper back, and each shoulder, while the profile dragons decorate the lower part of the robe, one pair confronted on the front and the other on the back. A fifth profile dragon, not seen when the robe is worn, occurs under the front overlap, for a total of nine dragons. In contrast, the kesa features eight dragons, three seen full-face and five in profile; one frontal dragon from a shoulder is missing.Dragon robes of the Qing dynasty featured comparatively narrow sleeves ending in crescent-shaped cuffs. The robes' decoration was standardized: appropriately placed dragons occurred among clouds at the top of the robe and water, waves, and mountains at the hem."
Sutra_Cover,"Sutras printed in the accordion-fold format were often encased by covers wrapped in decorative silks. Covers both protected the sacred words and presented the sutras in beautiful envelopes that signaled the importance of the contents within. These examples from the sixteenth century indicate the variety of sutra cover motifs, including some seemingly irrelevant to Buddhist philosophy, such as dragons, phoenixes, or the character shou, meaning longevity"

"Buddha,_possibly_Amitabha,_on_a_peacock","This is a rare representation of a Buddha riding on a peacock. The choice of mount suggests that the figure may be Buddha Amitabha, celestial Buddha of the West."
Poem_of_Farewell_to_Liu_Man,"Yelü Chucai played a pivotal role in mitigating the harsh rule of the Mongols over the occupied territories of North China. A trusted adviser to both Chinggis Khan and his son ?g?dei, he introduced fiscal reforms and an amnesty for tax debts. Unfortunately, many of his administrative reforms were short-lived.The blunt, monumental writing on this handscroll, with its emphatic hooks and dots and square character forms, recalls the unrestrained style of Huang Tingjian (1045–1105), a Northern Song master who advocated ""driving every brushstroke with full force."" The poem lauds the virtuous administration of a young official in an era of widespread exploitation and reflects Yelü's own attempts to institute more humanitarian policies:Half the population of Yun[zhong] and Xuan[de] have fledtheir homes;Only the few thousand people under your care are secure.You are among our dynasty's most able administrators.Your good name is as lofty as Mount Tai.On the sixteenth day of the tenth lunar month in the winter of the gengzi year, Liu Man of Yangmen requested that I write a poem on the eve of his departure. I wrote this for him in admiration of his administrative ability. Abusive officials and wily functionaries should feel ashamed! Yuquan [Yelü Chucai]"
Seated_Buddha,"The Buddha is shown preaching with one finger of his right hand extended to call the earth to witness. A removable panel in the back reveals a cavity that contained a group of silks representing the five vital organs, together with seeds, symbolic objects, and prayers. One of these prayers includes a date corresponding to May 9, 1411, when the sculpture was dedicated."
The_Demon_Queller_Zhong_Kui_Giving_His_Sister_Away_in_Marriage,"Here, the legendary ""demon queller"" Zhong Kui leads his sister to her new home accompanied by an escort of demons performing feats of martial prowess. The comic climax to this spectacle is Zhong Kui himself—stone drunk and propped atop a small donkey by three retainers while his sister sits helplessly astride a recalcitrant water buffalo. The painting illustrates a rebus: ""marrying off one's sister"" (jia mei) is a pun for ""subjugating demons.""Yan Geng may have derived inspiration from actual New Year's processions, during which costumed figures impersonating Zhong Kui and his band of demons circulated through neighborhoods and banished evil in return for payment. Paintings on this subject clearly enjoyed widespread appeal, perhaps serving as auspicious gifts for the New Year."
Box_with_long-tailed_birds_and_peonies,"On the side of the cover are abstract, rocklike forms. They provide a groundline, often seen in sixteenth-century lacquer works, for the auspicious peonies and long-tailed birds on the cover."
Incense_Box_(Kōgō)_with_Camellias,"Small boxes of this type, which are preserved in Japan in some number, are often identified as incense boxes, for they were used as such during the tea ceremony. It seems likely that boxes of this type were also used in China to hold incense or other powdered substances such as cosmetics. The camellia spray on the cover is set against a plain background, a characteristic of early carved lacquers that would reemerge in the sixteenth century."
"Jar_decorated_with_rock,_peonies,_and_birds","This colorful jar follows the traditional enameling technique developed during the fifteenth century. Featuring a solid tone, the overglaze enamels are polychromatic but blue appears only in the underglaze, as seen in the outlines around the jar’s neck, shoulder, and base. The dominant use of green, appearing in different hues on rocks, leaves, and the birds’ feathers, is typical of the period. Wares of this type are often identified in the West with the French term famille verte, or “green family.”"
"Inscriptions_on_the_Stone_Drums_(Eastern_Zhou_dynasty,_5th_century_BCE)","Written Chinese evolved slowly over more than two millennia before arriving at a modern, ""regular"" script (kai shu) in the third century A.D. The oldest script type, known as ""seal"" script (zhuan shu), developed gradually during the Shang, Zhou, and Qin periods (ca. 1500–206 B.C.) and is characterized by curvilinear picturelike forms executed in strokes of even thickness.Inscriptions on the Ten Stone Drums, which record royal hunting expeditions, were probably engraved by one of the early dukes of the Qin state and constitute the earliest monumental seal-script texts of any length to survive. The script represents a transitional style between the ""large-seal"" script found on Shang and Zhou bronze vessels and the standardized ""small-seal"" script employed in official documents of the Qin dynasty (221–206 B.C.). The drums, discovered near Baoji in Shaanxi Province in the seventh century A.D., were moved to the imperial palace in Kaifeng by Emperor Huizong (r. 1101–25). When Jurchen Jin troops captured the Song capital in 1127, the drums were moved again to Beijing, where they are now in the Palace Museum.The tradition of making ink rubbings of stone- and wood-carved inscriptions was a precursor to printing in China and made possible the wide dissemination of calligraphic models."
Pair_of_screens_with_scenes_from_Romance_of_the_West_Chamber,"Small screens of lacquer or ivory were used as decoration for a desk or study in the Ming and Qing periods. This pair depicts two episodes from Romance of the West Chamber (Xixiang Ji), one of the most popular novels in China. The story recounts star-crossed lovers: the impoverished scholar Zhang Gong and Cui Yingying, the daughter of a retired chancellor. In their first encounter, seen on the lefthand panel, the hero is enthralled by the beauty of the heroine. On the righthand panel, Yingying prays on a moonlit night."
“Magic_Fountain”_ewer,"This ewer illustrates the vivid artistic and cultural exchange between China, the Middle East, and Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The pear-shaped ewer with curving spout and handle can be traced back to metal pitchers from the Middle East. Successfully rendering this foreign design with porcelain, from the fourteenth century onward Chinese potters made this type of ewer for both domestic and foreign markets. The heavily potted body, slightly bluish glaze, and rich cobalt blue décor are characteristic features of Jingdezhen porcelain from the mid-sixteenth century, which helps to date this piece. The “magic fountain” motif likely has a European source. In 1952, the late Sir Percival David connected this image to the legendary silver wine fountain designed by a Parisian goldsmith Guillaume Boucher for the Mongol Khan Mongke (r. 1251–1259) while Boucher served at Mongke’s court in Karakorum in present-day Mongolia. Scholars have since suggested that the image was more likely to have been inspired by a sixteenth-century European print, painting, or tapestry and were first commissioned by Jesuit missionaries in China. When such vessels reached Europe, they were highly valued and have even appeared in still life paintings, such as one by Williem Kalf (1619–1693) now in the collection of Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum, Madrid"
Ornament_with_landscape_and_figures,"This elaborate sculpture depicts a wooded landscape. Two travelers walk along a mountain path, and a rider journeys to visit a friend living in the small hut on the upper corner. This house in the forest represents an ideal retreat for Confucian scholars wishing to escape the mundane world of official duties. The dense composition and the linear depiction of the figures, drapery, and pine and banana trees relate closely to contemporary woodblock prints, illustrating the exchange of imagery across artistic media."
Chair_Strip,"Unlike upholstered furniture, chairs in China were covered only temporarily with textiles, such as this silk tapestry (kesi) chair strip, designed and woven specifically as a chair covering. The lobed floral medallion was positioned on the seat of the chair, and the four-clawed dragon (mang) adorned the back. At the top of the strip, the crane is upside down because that short portion was meant to hang down behind the chair."
Oval_cup_with_chi_dragons_amid_clouds,"Two long, sinuous dragons, of a type known as chihulong, are carved along the edges of the cup. The incised pattern decorating the cup resembles an auspicious fungus known as a lingzhi that is symbolic of the granting of wishes."
Table_Valance_with_Winter_Garden,"Among the winter plants in this table frontal’s main decorative area are camellias, nandina berries, and a blossoming tree, perhaps a wax plum (lamei), all woven largely with metallic thread. The impressive rock on the left suggests that the scene is a close-up of a carefully cultivated garden. Like its autumnal counterpart, also exhibited here, this valance features an overhanging top register with the attributes of the Eight Daoist Immortals."
Archaic-style_cup_with_ring_handle,"The abstract bodies of the two intertwined birds on the surface of this cup can be traced to the Bronze Age. The shape of the cup is based on similar jade cups of the Western Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 9), and so are the multiple raised dots in the background, which derive ultimately from the simulated granulation on the surface of metalwork of the late Eastern Zhou dynasty (770–256 B.C.)."
Circular_textile_with_two_phoenixes,"This textile features a pair of phoenixes on a golden background among flowers of various seasons; clockwise from the lower left, they are lotus, camellia, prunus, tree peony, and auspicious fungus. The composition is anchored at the bottom by a garden rock."
Table_Valance_with_Autumn_Garden,"The autumn plants in the main decorative area of this table valance appear in a garden setting with rocks and a stream; a pair of birds, whose backs are woven with feathers, flutter among the branches at the right. The overhanging upper register of the valance features an entirely different pattern: the attributes of the Eight Daoist Immortals, beribboned and interspersed with clouds and bats, are seen on either side of the central motif of a bat holding a canopy."
Book_or_Sutra_Cover_with_Lady_Bearing_a_Conch,"Sutras printed in the accordion-fold format were often encased by covers wrapped in decorative silks. Covers both protected the sacred words and presented the sutras in beautiful envelopes that signaled the importance of the contents within. These examples from the sixteenth century indicate the variety of sutra cover motifs, including some seemingly irrelevant to Buddhist philosophy, such as dragons, phoenixes, or the character shou, meaning longevity"
Panel_with_boys_at_play,"This textile is probably a portion of a much larger piece, perhaps a hanging, that would have illustrated many groups of small boys at play in a garden. Items bearing this popular theme were particularly favored as wedding gifts, for the boys symbolize increase, abundance, and future happiness."
Woman’s_robe_decorated_with_crane_medallions,"Each of the round medallions on this robe features a red-crowned crane, a symbol of longevity, carrying in its beak a lingzhi fungus, another symbol of long life. These are surrounded by a ring of bottle gourds (good fortune and professional success) and bats (good fortune). Worn on a special occasion, this robe would have virtually glowed with auspicious meaning."
Covered_box_decorated_with_the_Seven_Sages_of_the_Bamboo_Grove,"The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove were a group of scholars and writers of the third century who chose spiritual freedom over political engagement during a chaotic era. Although in reality they may not have known one another personally, they are said to have gathered in a bamboo grove near the house of the group’s leader, Ji Kang (ca. 223–ca. 262), to enjoy wine, music, and metaphysical discourse. The surface decoration on these two vessels shows the sages engaged in a variety of scholarly pursuits. The imagery circling the outer wall of the censer creates a sense of continuity that could not be achieved in a painting."
Dragon_Roundel_from_a_Ceremonial_Garment,"This piece is from a set of four roundels, decorated the chest, back, and shoulders of a prince’s formal ceremonial garment. Each roundel bears a dragon-in-clouds pattern on a navy blue ground, and seven of the eight auspicious Buddhist symbols appear in the clouds around the edges—the canopy, endless knot, fish, lotus, umbrella, vase, and wheel. (Only the conch is missing.) The roundels for the chest and the back feature a frontal dragon (zheng long), while those for the shoulders show a dragon in motion (xing long) with its head in profile.The emperor’s formal ceremonial garment is decorated in the same way, except that all four dragons appear frontally."
Jar_decorated_with_auspicious_characters_amid_plants,"This pot features four auspicious characters: fortune (fu 福), longevity (shou 壽), peace (ning 寧), and health (kang 康). Rendered in a highly stylized format, the characters are set as a part of vibrant pine trees, bamboo, and plum blossoms. Known as “Three Friends of Winter,” this plant combination symbolizes the lofty virtue of resilience."
Censer_decorated_with_the_Seven_Sages_of_the_Bamboo_Grove,"The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove were a group of men who retreated from society during the turbulent third century to pursue music, engage in pure conversation, and drink wine in the rustic wilds beyond the reach of daily affairs. This vessel, made to hold burning incense, depicts the Sages ensconced amid stalks of bamboo, distanced from the cares of the world."
Dragon_Roundel_from_a_Ceremonial_Garment,"This piece is from a set of four roundels decorated the chest, back, and shoulders of a prince’s formal ceremonial garment. Each roundel bears a dragon-in-clouds pattern on a navy blue ground, and seven of the eight auspicious Buddhist symbols appear in the clouds around the edges—the canopy, endless knot, fish, lotus, umbrella, vase, and wheel. (Only the conch is missing.) The roundels for the chest and the back feature a frontal dragon (zheng long), while those for the shoulders show a dragon in motion (xing long) with its head in profile.The emperor’s formal ceremonial garment is decorated in the same way, except that all four dragons appear frontally."
Luohan_with_an_armrest,"A luohan with crossed legs leans on a curving armrest. With an animated expression, he points out his finger, as if lecturing the Buddhist doctrine to a rapt audience of monks."
"Mountain_scene_in_the_form_of_pine,_cranes,_and_immortals","The central figure in this bold relief carving is a Daoist deity accompanied by an attendant and several cranes, symbols of longevity."
Peanuts_and_jujube_dates,"In this charming carving, a master craftsman has cleverly adapted the sculptural design to the stone’s original shape and colors. The artist used the translucent brown gem to create the glazed surface of the fruit and the yellowish opaque crust for the bumpy look of the peanut shells. The peanuts and jujube dates are rebuses: the words rhyme with the phrase “may you have children soon” (zao sheng gui zi), a common wish for newly married couples."
"Plaque_with_dragon,_pheasant,_quail,_and_other_birds_amidst_bamboo_and_plum_blossom","Despite the Qianlong mark (1736–95) carved into the back of this plaque, stylistic features, such as the dragon’s large horns and awkwardly rendered claws, indicate that this object was produced later, possibly for export. It is decorated with an incised landscape on the back."
Dragon_Roundel_from_a_Ceremonial_Garment,"This piece is from a set of four roundels, decorated the chest, back, and shoulders of a prince’s formal ceremonial garment. Each roundel bears a dragon-in-clouds pattern on a navy blue ground, and seven of the eight auspicious Buddhist symbols appear in the clouds around the edges—the canopy, endless knot, fish, lotus, umbrella, vase, and wheel. (Only the conch is missing.) The roundels for the chest and the back feature a frontal dragon (zheng long), while those for the shoulders show a dragon in motion (xing long) with its head in profile.The emperor’s formal ceremonial garment is decorated in the same way, except that all four dragons appear frontally."
Child_with_basket_of_magical_fungus,"The child’s basket contains lingzhi (cloud-like mushrooms), symbols of immortality and good wishes, which imply the figure is an immortal."
Brush_washer_in_the_shape_of_lotus_leaf_with_chi_dragons,"Two dragons with felinelike heads, known as chi, decorate the ends of this brush washer, which is carved from an opaque piece of white nephrite. Brown and yellow inclusions give the work an aged appearance. Historical records indicate that variegated jade was highly valued from the twelfth to the fourteenth century."
Early_spring_landscape,"Throughout the mid-thirteenth century, during the reign of Emperor Lizong (r. 1224–64), the Southern Song Painting Academy continued to flourish under the leadership of Ma Yuan, Xia Gui, Li Song, and Ma Yuan's son Ma Lin. In landscape painting, the decorative realism of Liu Songnian (active ca. 1150–after 1225) remained popular. Evening in the Spring Hills, a fan painting by an anonymous midthirteenth- century master, recalls Liu's sumptuous landscape style. Seen below two great pine trees with ball-shaped clusters of pine needles and twisting branches executed in a smooth polished brushwork is a bird's-eye view of a private garden in the hills outside Hangzhou. On a fresh spring evening, the branches flowering with perfect pink blossoms, the garden owner and his guest stand in a pavilion that overlooks a broad valley to view the green hills with notched silhouettes in the distance."
Inkstone_with_Bamboo_Design,"The green inkstone is carved in the shape of bamboo stem segments and is adorned in low relief with leafy branches rising from behind rocks. The slanted surface of the sunken grinding area displays multiple layers of natural markings within the stone in purple and various shades of green. The wooden box is also carved in the shape of a length of bamboo.The ink slab and its case bear three inscriptions, which offer clues and raise questions about the work's date. An inscription on the underside of the stone and one on the lid of the box, although signed Qinggong Daoren and Nancun, respectively, both have the same seal, Zuo. While these names are unknown from other sources, they probably denote the same person. The stone's inscription is dated to 1370, which is curiously early, considering the good condition of the box. The third inscription, on the upper side of the slab, comprising eight delicate characters executed in regular script, is dated to the summer solstice of the renwu year (1702), signed Wang Shizhen (1634–1711), a preeminent poet of the early Qing period, and is followed by Wang's seal, Yuan. If this inscription is not a genuine ownership mark by Wang Shizhen, it is likely to have been added either during Wang's time or not long after his death. From 1722 onward, because the character zhen in Wang's name also occurred in the personal name of the newly enthroned Yongzheng emperor (r. 1723–35), the characters of Wang's name were replaced by others that have a similar sound. Since here Wang's name was written in its original form, the inscription was probably carved before 1722."
Inkstone_with_Su_Wu,"The back of this inkstone is adorned with a picture of Su Wu (d. 60 B.C.), an emissary of the Han dynasty who was detained by a nomadic ruler to tend goats in the frigid steppeland of southern Siberia. It is carved out of a fine-grained stone with natural markings that was quarried in Shaoxiang, Guangdong Province. Its low water permeability and low absorbency, as well as the inclusion of moderately hard grains within its fine structures, make it an excellent material for inkstones."
Box_with_dragon_design,"The five-clawed dragon in the center of this lid holds up the character sheng, which means “divine (or imperial) majesty.” The rocks and waves below the dragon symbolize the mountain and the sea. Taken together, these motifs illustrate the imperial authority ruling over the universe. Similarly styled dragons are seen on works in different materials, such as textile medallions, from the same period."
Panel_with_cranes_over_an_immortal_land,"Two cranes holding sticks in their beaks fly above a landscape. A pavilion below holds a vase containing several more sticks. Cranes and sticks symbolize longevity; the source of the imagery is a legend about a man who measured his age by the number of sticks he stuck into an immortal land. The poem embroidered on the right is dated 1777 and describes this immortal land, making this panel an ideal gift for a birthday celebration. The poem bears seals of Niu Yizu (active late 18th century), a prefect of Xuzhou known for his calligraphy, who wrote the script that was used for the embroidery."
"Vessel_with_mythical_creatures,_flowers,_and_birds","The shape of this vessel, probably used for pouring liquids, derives from Tibet and may have been made for use in China or as a gift to a Tibetan temple or high-ranking monk"
Pair_of_boxes_with_melons_and_butterflies,"The combination of melons and butterflies is a pun on an old idiom that expresses a wish for many offspring, like melons on vines. This encoded meaning makes this pair of boxes a likely gift for a wedding."
Ornament_with_Squirrels_and_Grapes,"Also a common theme in painting, squirrels and grapes—both known for their ability to multiply—allude to wishes for generations of children, particularly boys. Amber, which was known in China as early as the third century, was imported from both the Baltic region and Burma."
Theatrical_Collar,This unusual collar is thought to have been worn theatrically for the role of a woman. Many of the small jade ornaments attached to its black satin lobes are probably reused from centuries earlier: such ornaments decorated women’s headdresses in northern China during the Liao and Jin dynasties.
Pillow_with_a_boy_holding_a_lotus,On the top of this pillow is a lively depiction of a boy holding a lotus flower. The potter crafted this simple but powerful representation by incising the image on the clay body and then applying colored glazes.
Picnic_basket_with_scene_from_Investiture_of_the_Gods,"The decorative designs on this box attest to the popular taste for the fantastical and the auspicious. Its cover displays an exciting scene from the sixteenth-century mythological novel Investiture of the Gods (Fengshen Yanyi). The fairy at the top left corner sends out magic scissors to cut her enemy; in the story he escapes, but his deer is less fortunate."
Panel_with_boys_at_play,无描述
Boy_with_lotus,无描述
Hanging_with_children_at_play,"This large polychrome silk embroidery features a popular motif known as “the hundred boys.” To express the desire for a prosperous family, hundreds of male children at play are depicted, usually in a beautiful garden. Here, 250 boys are engaging in various activities, such as wrestling, hide and seek, butterfly catching, deer riding, and playing with a ball. Each child is embroidered in a different posture with simple but fluid outlines, which required not only intensive skill but also artistic sensibility. Hangings like this usually served as wall decorations in wedding celebrations."
Snuff_bottle_with_demon_queller_Zhong_Kui,"This fierce-looking figure is the legendary demon queller Zhong Kui. He is depicted in vibrant red paint on both sides of the bottle. A pale blue demon is painted on the object’s underside, which implies it was crushed under Zhong Kui’s feet."
Snuff_Bottle_with_Scene_of_a_Lotus_Pond,"CDAG snuff IDs ceramics REPRO.indd 5 7/10/13 8:08 AMSnuff Bottle with Scene of a Lotus PondQing dynasty (1644–1911), Daoguang mark and period (1821–50)Porcelain with overglazed enamel colors, ivory stopperBequest of Benjamin Altman, 1913 (14.40.559a, b)"
Snuff_bottle_with_squirrels,"This exquisite work of carved lacquer has representations of a popular animal: the squirrel. This small rodent is prized not only for its preciousness but also for being a highly fertile animal. Depicted playing among vines with bunches of grapes, another symbol of multiple offspring, squirrels express wishes for a large family."
Dish_with_scene_of_a_family,"Scenes of children and families, like the one on this porcelain dish, became increasingly popular during the Qing dynasty. The central scene represents an intimate moment in which a man seated in the hall of a two-story house watches his wife and two boys play in a walled garden"
Dish_with_a_couple_and_phoenixes,"This dish displays a romantic story known as Phoenixes Arriving for Flute Playing (chuixiao yinfeng). Nongyu, the daughter of Duke Mu of Qin State (reigned 659–21 B.C.) married a famous flute (xiao) player. According to this legend, the couple spent all their time practicing the flute. After several years, even phoenixes came to listen to their music. One day, the couple rode away on the phoenixes and never returned."
Dish_with_a_Child_Chasing_a_Fish,"It seems likely that, in addition to its playful quality, the theme of a child catching a fish, presumably a carp, also had overtones of good wishes. It remains unclear as to whether this dish had a function or served as an object for display."
Screen_with_deities,"Designed as a table screen sitting on a wood stand, this jade disk is engraved with images of the Daoist God of Sun, on the front, and Goddess of Moon, on the back."
Mirror_with_game_board_design,"The diagrammatic decoration on the back of this mirror points to a new cosmology. The square world—aligned with the four cardinal directions and inscribed with the “twelve earthly branches” used to compute the calendar—is surrounded by the circular heavens ringed in turn by the waves of the cosmic ocean. Sharing the heavenly realm with the animals of the four directions (the red bird of the south, white tiger of the west, entwined turtle and snake of the north, and the blue dragon of the east) and other mythical creatures are T-, L-, and V-shaped markings that recall the measuring devices and rulers used by Fu Xi and Nu Wa, who were believed to have created the universe. The same “TLV” design also appears on the liubo game board, suggesting that a game of chance also plays a part in the workings of the universe."
Theatrical_Costume_for_the_Role_of_a_Warrior,"This costume is for the role of a high-ranking warrior. A nearly identical costume is in the Qing court collection of theatrical costumes in the Palace Museum, Beijing."
Tablet_with_Design_for_a_Carpet,The use of a precious material such as ivory to make a model of a carpet was typical of the famously extravagant Qianlong Emperor. The design of a roundel filled with flowers and surrounded by floral scrolls can also be found in porcelains and other objects from the eighteenth century.
Woman's_Ceremonial_Robe,"This warmly padded ceremonial robe with roundels would have been worn by a Manchu woman for celebrations of the winter months, but the embroidered flowers in decorative containers are from all the seasons, including a lotus for summer, a chrysanthemum for autumn, nandina berries for winter, and plum blossoms for spring, as well as the full-blown peony with an orchid in the center vase."
Theatrical_Robe_for_a_Male_Role,"This theatrical robe was designed to be worn by an elite male on a casual occasion. Its original form was derived from a long jacket of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). It is beautifully embroidered using the needlepoint technique and is similar in color and pattern to Qing court theatrical costumes, now at the Palace Museum, Beijing."
Vase_with_Birthday_Reception_for_General_Guo_Ziyi,"This vase shows the birthday celebration for the Tang dynasty general Guo Ziyi (697–781). The scene at the foot of the vase shows the arrival of guests bearing gifts, among them a court robe and hat. The body of the vase features a joyful reception where the general and his wife receive congratulatory wishes from family members and guests. At the top of the vase, none other than Shoulao himself, the god of longevity, presides over the festivities, flanked by the eight Daoist immortals. The identity of Guo Ziyi, who achieved the rank of prince of Fenyang after suppressing the An Lushan rebellion, is confirmed by the inscription ""Fenyang Manor"" (Fenyang fu) above the entrance to the residence."
Woman's_informal_robe,"Embroidered in brightly colored silks and gold on the woolen ground of this robe is a roughly symmetrical arrangement of the ""hundred antiques,"" lavishly complemented with fruit and flowers. At the bottom center of the robe, between containers of narcissus flowers, the scholarly tradition is represented by brushes, a scroll of silk or paper for calligraphy or painting, coral branches, and a fly whisk, all objects associated with the literati.A little higher, below vessels containing sumptuous fullblown peonies and other flowers, is a long slender object shaped like a mushroom at one end and seen here with a tassel at the other end. This implement is called a ruyi, and as it figures in rebuses to symbolize the fulfillment of a wish, the presence of a ruyi often signals that a word puzzle is at hand. Here it is seen with a bowl containing a peach and a Buddha's-hand citron, fruits associated with longevity and prosperity. Represented on the inner part of the sleeves on either side of this robe are utensils for burning incense, each set consisting of an incense burner, a small round box for storing incense, and a cylindrical holder containing a spatula and tongs for manipulating the burning incense. Sets of utensils for burning incense were indispensable accessories in a scholar's studio."
Presentation_dish_for_an_imperial_lecture1621,"The mark in the rectangular cartouche on the top of the dish notes it was a gift made for an imperial lecture (jingyan) in 1621. In this type of lecture, erudite officials taught Confucian classics to the emperor, who often presented the teachers with valuable gifts, such as this rare example of skillful metalwork from the imperial Ming workshop. The decoration shows a scholar official, proudly walking under a parasol, being escorted to the palace for an imperial lecture."
Bowl_with_inscription,"Porcelain produced during the short reign of the Longqing emperor is rare. The elegantly written inscription quotes from the Song of the Lady with the Silk Worms, a poem by the famed Xie Fangde (1226–1289), and reads in part: “Not only does the moon shine through the willows before the storied house but pretty girls continue to dance and sing ...take heed lest the silkworms have not enough leaves.”"
White-Robed_Guanyin,"The ivory white porcelain of the Dehua kilns of Fujian was well-suited to representing Guanyin, especially in her white?robed form, and the kiln produced countless sculptures of the bodhisattva to meet the public’s insatiable demand. This is a particularly grand example, befitting a wealthy residence."
Sutra_cover,"Sutras printed in the accordion-fold format were often encased by covers wrapped in decorative silks. Covers both protected the sacred words and presented the sutras in beautiful envelopes that signaled the importance of the contents within. These examples from the sixteenth century indicate the variety of sutra cover motifs, including some seemingly irrelevant to Buddhist philosophy, such as dragons, phoenixes, or the character shou, meaning longevity"

Stele_of_the_Xuanmi_Pagoda,"In 841, a stupa was constructed at the Anguo Monastery, in the Tang dynasty capital of Chang’an, to preserve the ashes of the great Buddhist monk Duan Fu (d. 807). A massive stone stele was erected on site to commemorate the creation of the stupa and to celebrate Duan’s accomplishments. The prominent official and calligrapher Liu Gongquan inscribed the text. Liu’s strongly angular, stately characters are well-suited to the sacred task of commemoration. The stele is considered a key example of the aesthetic superiority of Tang calligraphy, and it is still widely copied by calligraphy students today."

Side_Panel_from_a_Sarcophagus,"The headstone of this sarcophagus is embellished with an acting troupe poised to perform on the balcony of a two-story building. The side panels feature narrative scenes illustrating twenty-four stories of filial piety. A very similar set of engraved illustrations was discovered on the sarcophagus of Pan Dechong (1191–1256), who was buried in 1260 on the grounds of the Yongle Palace, a famous Daoist temple located in southwestern Shanxi Province. Pan was a leading member of the Quanzhen sect of northern Daoism, which advocated the importance of filial behavior, so it is not surprising that the Confucian theme of filial paragons was adopted to decorate his sarcophagus. The significance of the theatrical troupe is still unclear.These narrative scenes are a popular manifestation of the subject matter and fine-line drawing style of the scholar-artist Li Gonglin (ca. 1041–1106), particularly his Classic of Filial Piety of around 1085. Li's masterpiece gave contemporary relevance to this canonical Confucian subject through a new expressive style of calligraphic brushwork as well as through the creation of a new set of illustrations that offered subtle commentaries on contemporary political and moral questions. The sarcophagus, which may be dated roughly two hundred years later, shows the widespread impact of Li's thematic concerns and drawing style on popular art forms"
Bodhisattva_Guanyin,"This lavish Guanyin was crafted out of a massive piece of spinach-hued jadeite with gray and tawny inclusions. Jadeite, originally from Burma, became extremely popular and even more valuable than nephrite jade in the nineteenth century. A sculpture of this scale, affordable only for the wealthiest families, was meant to communicate supreme respect for Guanyin."
Temple_vase_with_dragons_and_clouds,"This vase was likely made as one of a pair for use as a flower container on a religious altar. The dragons are typical of Ming style, with thick, sinewy bodies and flowing manes."
Vase_with_scenes_and_poems_from_Farming_and_Weaving,"Rice farming and silk production, both represented here, were cornerstones of agrarian society in premodern China. Woodcuts made after imperial court paintings based on the twelfth-century text Farming and Weaving (Geng Zhi Tu) were widely used as models for artworks in other media, such as this vase. The headings of the texts on the front and back sides of the vase are “soaking rice seeds” (jinzhong) and “harvesting silkworm cocoons” (xiacu)."
Covered_box_with_vajra,"The two crossed vajra pestles depicted on the box’s cover are commonly used in Esoteric Buddhist rituals. In the shape of a club with multiple prongs on both ends, the vajra is a ritual weapon with indestructible and irresistible power symbolizing the energy of enlightenment. This ornament indicates the box was originally made for Buddhist ritual use, likely as a container of incense."
Monthly_flower_cup_(from_set_of_twelve),"This cup is from a set of twelve representing the flora of each month of the lunar year. It illustrates a pomegranate tree, associated with the fifth month. The design, finely painted in a combination of underglaze blue and transparent overglaze enamels, is accompanied by a poem on the reverse side"
Bodhisattva_Guanyin,"Like many Buddhist sculptures, this one originally contained, in its hollow interior, a paper dedication inscribed with the patron’s wishes. Though the bodhisattva does not take the outward form of Guanyin the Bringer of Sons, the inscription expresses the patron’s hope for a male heir: “The [Buddhist] believers Kong Xishan and his wife wholeheartedly commission the carving of this golden-bodied Guanyin in order to entreat [Guanyin] to fulfill our wishes that we may live together to old age and have a fine son soon.”"
Monthly_flower_cup_(from_set_of_twelve),"This cup is from a set of twelve representing the flora of each month of the lunar year. It features a hare sitting by an osmanthus tree with yellow flowers, representing the eighth month. The design, finely painted in a combination of underglaze blue and transparent overglaze enamels, is accompanied by a poem on the reverse side."
Dish_with_scholar_by_a_lotus_pond,"On this dish, a scholar sits beneath a tree while an attendant picks lotus flowers. The scene recalls a story of the Song-dynasty scholar-official Zhou Dunyi (1017–73), who was known for his fondness of the lotus, a sign of a nature lover."
"Li_Tieguai,_Daoist_Immortal","These bronze sculptures (with SL.17.2019.1.1) capture the playful appeal of the Daoist immortals Liu Hai and Li Tieguai. Li supports himself on his famous iron crutch, with an enormous gourd full of magical elixirs slung across his shoulder, while his friend Liu Hai plays with his companion, a massive toad. These lighthearted sculptures would have been well-suited to the reception hall of a cultured family, where their fine craftsmanship and playful spirit would have added a touch of learned whimsy"
"Sutra_of_the_Repentance_Ritual_of_Great_Compassion_(Cibei_daochang_chanfa),_Volume_1","Printed sutras usually took the form of accordion-fold books, and they often featured an illustrated frontispiece. Legend states that the repentance ritual described in this sutra was instituted by Emperor Wu of Liang (464–549) to deliver his deceased wife from an unpleasant reincarnation as a python. This is the story depicted in the illustrated frontispiece, where a group of Buddhist monks industriously undertake the rituals prescribed in the sutra. The empress’s spirit floats free from the mouth of the snake, ascending heavenward on a cloud."
"Liu_Hai,_Daoist_Immortal","These bronze sculptures (with SL.17.2019.1.2) capture the playful appeal of the Daoist immortals Liu Hai and Li Tieguai. Li supports himself on his famous iron crutch, with an enormous gourd full of magical elixirs slung across his shoulder, while his friend Liu Hai plays with his companion, a massive toad. These lighthearted sculptures would have been well-suited to the reception hall of a cultured family, where their fine craftsmanship and playful spirit would have added a touch of learned whimsy"
Valance,"Qing dynasty (1644–1911), early 18th century Silk and metallic thread embroidery on silk satin Birds, flowers, and pomegranates flank an exuberant and prolific peach tree at the center of this embroidered valance, which is imbued with themes of fertility and longevity. Below the tree is a stream in which floats an imposing golden bell, antique in form, accompanied by a halberd and a musical stone, two items that form the rebus for a celebratory occasion."
"Pair_of_table_screens_with_flowers,_birds,_and_poems","Ducks and water plants are incised into one of this pair of screens; small birds perched on plum blossoms adorn the other. Both images are inspired by poems engraved on the backs of the screens. One, by Zhu Xi (1130–1200), describes the tranquil sound of the swimming ducks. The other, by an unidentified poet, refers to the opening of the petals of a tea plum."
"Buddha,_probably_Shakyamuni_(Shijiamouni)","Scientific analysis reveals that this sculpture was carved in north China and has a radiocarbon date range of 1040–1260. The simple dress and solemn facial expression of the Buddha are typical of Buddhist sculpture of the Jin dynasty. This Buddha was likely once the main figure of a triad, attended by two bodhisattvas and/or luohans."
Textile_panel_with_phoenixes_and_lotuses_holding_the_Eight_Buddhist_Treasures,"Bright yellow was the color reserved for the imperial family. On this panel, brocaded with gold and polychrome threads, four flying phoenixes alternate with lotus flowers, each holding two Buddhist symbols. These symbols—an umbrella with paired fish, a vase with lotus, a conch shell with an endless knot, and a canopy with a wheel—constitute the Eight Buddhist Treasures, a standard design used by the imperial workshop. Introduced with Buddhism, this imagery is also found in contemporary porcelain, cloisonné, and other media."
Butterfly,"The butterfly is usually associated with joy and weddings, but as its name (hudie) is a pun for ""age seventy to eighty,"" it is also a symbol for longevity."
Garden_seat_with_scene_of_a_lotus_pond,"Barrel-shaped garden seats, often made of wood or rattan, can be traced to the twelfth century. Porcelain examples, ideal for summertime, gained popularity in the sixteenth century with the development of a ceramic technique for firing large pieces. Here, rings of embossed dots around the top and bottom recall prototypes with fastenings for leather or fabric seat covers."
Sutra_cover_with_flower_scrolls_and_auspicious_symbols,"Luxury silk features prominently in covers of Buddhist sutras commissioned by the Ming court. Ornamental patterns on these textiles often reflect a standard design from the imperial workshop. Here, colorful flower scrolls are rendered in the same style as those found on imperial cloisonné enamel and ceramics."
Garden_seat_with_birds_and_flowers,Cloisonné was used in the production of luxury furniture starting in the sixteenth century. The colorful birds and flowers decorating this seat would have added an extra touch of brilliance in a blossoming garden.
Lobed_Plaque,"The silver jeweled ornaments of the Turkoman tribes of Central Asia are characterized by their bold forms, striking profiles, and prominent semiprecious stones, most often carnelians or turquoise. By the nineteenth century, the once seminomadic Turkoman people had settled in various parts of Iran, Afghanistan, and Chinese and former Soviet Central Asia, but metalworkers' guilds continued to hold an honored position in each center. Turkoman silversmiths produced a variety of objects in a style and with motifs that reflected both Islamic and shamanist cultural influences: jewelry for women and children; ornaments and fittings for knives, helmets, and belts; and harnesses and other embellishments for horses and other animals.This pendant of somewhat unusual form originally hung from a chain threaded through metal rings attached to the loops on the rectangular plate at the top. The combination of filigree and a thicker silver rim is often seen in Turkoman silver jewelry. The use of blue stones as protection from the ""evil eye"" has a long history in Islamic culture, particularly in the Persianate world."
Brick_with_Ax-Chariot,"Pictorial bricks appeared frequently on the walls of Eastern Han tombs. In addition to floral and geometric designs, they sometimes bear narrative scenes of hunting, farming, feasting, dancing, and acrobatics. As such, they recreate activities that the tomb occupants enjoyed in life and wished to take with them into the afterlife. This brick shows a chariot drawn by a spirited horse. The two charioteers guard a large ax—a symbol of military authority accorded to government officials above the rank of district magistrate. The lively scene illustrates the procession of a high-ranking official, thereby signaling the prominence of the deceased."
Brick_with_Banquet_Scene,"This brick presents a scene of a luxury banquet with multiple entertainments. At the top right are a juggler and an acrobat. A lady with long sleeves dances at the bottom right, while a clumsy figure opens his arms to catch her. Two musicians sit behind the dancers. At top left, the host and hostess sit with tripods of wine before them, enjoying the performances. Simple but lively, these reliefs provide insight into the Han lifestyle, a time from which few other pictorial materials have survived."
Odes_of_the_State_of_Bin,"Composed more than 2,500 years ago, Odes of the State of Bin is part of The Book of Odes, one of the Confucian classics. The poem chronicles the annual cycle of activites in the countryside: the unfolding stages of the agricultural and sericultural year; preparation for seasonal changes; domestic activities; sources of nourishment; and requisite ritual acts. This scroll, a work in the baimiao (""plain drawing"") style executed in the thirteenth century, uses a continuous narrative format; no text is included. Lacking illustrations to the first two stanzas of the poem, it opens with a scene of picking mulberry leaves for silkworms."
Brick_with_the_Mother_Queen_of_the_West,"This decorative brick presents an iconic view of Xiwangmu, the Mother Queen of the West. According to Han belief, she governed the land of the immortals. Here, she sits on a throne, dignified by a canopy and guarded by a dragon and a tiger. She wears a special headgear known as sheng. Her attendants—a three-legged bird, a toad, a hare, and a nine-tailed fox—are nearby. Her maids receive a kowtowing figure, presumably the deceased in whose tomb this brick was discovered. An immortal, the one who guided the deceased to this place, stands behind him."
Brick_with_Scene_of_Hunting_and_Harvesting,"Most noteworthy in this scene of hunting and harvesting are the two kneeling archers taking aim at a flock of birds in flight. To the left of each archer is a group of four triangular devices, at least one of which is connected to an arrow with a cord. These features may reflect a unique shooting method called yishe, or corded-arrow hunting, which was a leisure activity among elites from the Eastern Zhou (771–256 B.C.) through the Eastern Han. Yishe involved firing an arrow attached to a silk cord with a weighted mechanism tied to its end. If a bird that had been struck attempted to fly away, the weighted arrow kept it grounded."
Brick_with_Scene_of_Salt_Production,"This brick records a rare scene of salt production. At the far left is a roofed, shafted structure containing four toiling figures. A pulley block identifies the structure as a salt well. Moving to the right, one can identify a set of evaporation pans over a furnace tended by a seated figure, as well as two additional figures, both with baskets on their backs, who transport salt from the well to the pans."
Vessel_for_Ritual_Offering_(Dou),"These vessels (25.143.1–.3) were used in state rituals held in the first lunar month of the year, during which the emperor made offerings to heaven at the Altar for Bountiful Harvest (Qigutan), part of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.In shape and decoration, these ceramic vessels—a gui and two dou—are modeled on bronze grain receptacles of the Eastern Zhou dynasty (770–256 B.C.), which would have formed part of a larger set of objects, employed in ritual offerings, that included containers for wine and meat. In later times, ceramic took the place of bronze, and vessels were color-coded according to one of four ritual altars at which the emperor conducted ceremonies: blue for heaven, yellow for earth, red for the sun, and white for the moon."
Precious_Spring_Longevity_Box,"The Qianlong emperor commissioned at least eighteen versions of this box. He especially valued the design on the top: a large representation of the character for spring (chun, an allusion to long life), and a small image of Shoulao, the god of longevity. The character and the overflowing bowl below it are set against a background of radiating rainbows. The bowl of treasures motif first appeared in carved lacquer in the sixteenth century; it was incorporated into this more complicated program of imagery during the reign of Qianlong."
Festival_Overcoat,"When the Manchus of the Qing dynasty came into power, they incorporated roundels with dragons into their official court dress, as seen on this woman's coat. This coat, called “jifu gua” or “longgua”, was designed to be worn over a festival robe. This overcoat is a rare example that can be dated to the early part of the eighteenth century by comparison to garments excavated from the tomb of Prince Guo, who died in 1738. After standardization in the mid-eighteenth century, coats with eight dragon roundels, such as this one, were reserved for the empress dowager, the empress, imperial concubines of the first, second, and third rank, and the consort of the crown prince."
Bowl_with_dragons,"The overglaze red and green enamels on this bowl add a colorful touch to the lively dragons painted in underglaze blue. Produced by the imperial workshop, this object demonstrates the courtly taste for color that developed in the fifteenth century."
Box_with_lychees,"Asymmetrical, fruit-shaped boxes such as this one were made as part of sets of vessels used to hold confections and stored together in a larger box. The depth of the carving of the lychees on the cover and the lattice patterns on the sides are both typical of eighteenth-century carved lacquer."
Vessel_for_Ritual_Offering_(Dou),"These vessels (25.143.1–.3) were used in state rituals held in the first lunar month of the year, during which the emperor made offerings to heaven at the Altar for Bountiful Harvest (Qigutan), part of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.In shape and decoration, these ceramic vessels—a gui and two dou—are modeled on bronze grain receptacles of the Eastern Zhou dynasty (770–256 B.C.), which would have formed part of a larger set of objects, employed in ritual offerings, that included containers for wine and meat. In later times, ceramic took the place of bronze, and vessels were color-coded according to one of four ritual altars at which the emperor conducted ceremonies: blue for heaven, yellow for earth, red for the sun, and white for the moon."
Arhat_holding_a_shoe,"Although not represented in Indian or Southeast Asian art, luohans (Sanskrit: arhats) play an important role in China, where they appear in both religious painting and sculpture and as a theme in the decorative arts. Originally the disciples of the Historical Buddha Shakyamuni, luohans are understood as protectors of Buddhism and the devout."
Snuff_Bottle_with_Flowers_and_Rocks,"Snuff, or powdered tobacco, was brought to China by Jesuit missionaries in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century. Its use spread quickly, as did demand for small containers to hold it. Snuff bottles were produced in large number and an astonishing variety of media, including metal, jade, ivory, bamboo, lacquer, and glass. Not all bottles were functional: many were collected as exoticisms or treasured for their precious materials and exquisite craftsmanship."
Rank_badge_with_two_phoenixes,"The phoenixes appear in a symbolic landscape of clouds, waves, and a decorative rock surrounded by colorful flora: (clockwise from lower left) auspicious fungus, camellia, prunus, and (dominating the right) tree peonies. Unpatterned edges at the top and bottom of the textile (now hidden under the mat) suggest it was woven for a special purpose, probably as a decorative rank insignia for a female member of the imperial household."
Incense_Burner,"Although seemingly random, the gold splashes on the surface of this incense burner and its matching stand were carefully applied to give the otherwise flat surface a sense of movement and depth."
Rectangular_box_in_imitation_of_a_pack_of_books,"The corner of this lid is inlaid with four characters: huang shi yi bian, meaning “inherited book from Yellowstone.” This inscription refers to a legend that Zhang Liang (ca. 250–186 B.C.), a founding strategist of the Han dynasty, had been given a secret book of strategy from the hermit Mr. Yellowstone. Its inclusion indicates that this box was probably used by the literati to present books or stationery. The chi dragon glaring at and grabbing the title appears to be a loyal guardian of the box’s content."
Medallion_with_two_peacocks,"This medallion was a badge for a civil official of the third rank in the Ming dynasty. Originally square, it has been cut, perhaps to serve as the cover for a round box. Ming-dynasty rank badges were usually woven or embroidered as part of an official’s robe; later, in the Qing dynasty, separate badges were applied to their garments."
Medallion_with_Five-Clawed_Dragon_(long),This dynamic dragon (long) surges across a golden ground. The brownish green thread of the dragon's body and head is made of peacock feathers.
Rank_Badge_with_Egret,"The egret corresponds to the sixth civil rank. The bird on this badge has lost most of the long white crest that is an identifying mark of the egret; however, a few white threads still remain near the head. These traces of the crest and the bird's green legs and bill confirm its identity.The rock on which the egret stands was once embroidered completely with peacock feather thread, now mostly lost. It would have shimmered with iridescence, rivaling the splendor of the gold background."
Box_with_scene_of_a_reception_and_boys_at_play,"The reception scene on the top of the box suggests the birthday gathering for the general Guo Ziyi, an impression reinforced by the many boys at play on the sides of the box. Guo Ziyi was said to have had one hundred sons and one thousand grandsons."
Woman’s_coat_with_crane_medallions,"This type of coat was worn with an inner robe for important family occasions and ceremonies, such as significant birthdays. This example features eight medallions, each consisting of a stylized crane surrounded by patterns of bottle-gourd vines. As cranes and bottle gourds symbolize longevity, this design expresses auspicious wishes appropriate to the occasions on which the robe would have been worn."
One_of_a_Pair_of_Chair_Strips_with_Auspicious_Patterns,"Unlike upholstered furniture in the West, chairs in China were, historically, covered only temporarily with textiles. These chair strips (see also 65.210.2) were designed and woven specifically for the purpose. As is typical of such strips, the length is divided into multiple segments, each bearing a different design for the part of the chair it covers—the front legs, seat, or back—as well as a short segment that hangsbehind the chair.This pair of auspiciously patterned chair strips was appropriate for special occasions such as birthday celebrations. Peaches (symbols of immortality) and the character for longevity (shou) decorate the segment behind the chair, and the front legs are covered with a pattern of pavilions in the sea, which probably refers to the isles of the immortals."

Peaches (symbols of immortality) and the character for longevity (shou) decorate the segment behind the chair, and the front legs are covered with a pattern of pavilions in the sea, which probably refers to the isles of the immortals."
Dish_with_Stylized_Flowers,"During the sixteenth century there was a general decline in the quality of official wares in all media, including cloisonné. Attention centered on productivity and efficiency, a change from the fifteenth century, when the primary aim was to make the finest objects regardless of cost. The duller palette and imprecise enameling and gilding show the effects of the commercially oriented production of the time."
Vase_decorated_with_bats_and_peaches_amid_scrolling_floral_vines_and_“double_happiness”_character,"The bats and peaches on this vase celebrate happiness and longevity. The character meaning “double happiness” (shuangxi 囍), which alludes to marital harmony, heightens the auspiciousness of the combined symbols."
Sutra_Cover_with_Lotus_Scroll,"Sutras printed in the accordion-fold format were often encased by covers wrapped in decorative silks. Covers both protected the sacred words and presented the sutras in beautiful envelopes that signaled the importance of the contents within. These examples from the sixteenth century indicate the variety of sutra cover motifs, including some seemingly irrelevant to Buddhist philosophy, such as dragons, phoenixes, or the character shou, meaning longevity"

Incense_Burner_with_the_Eighteen_Luohans,"This ceramic vessel captures both the playfulness and power of the luohans (arhats). At right, one luohan fords a river on the back of a tiger while his companion hails a flying dragon; at left, more luohans welcome their companions, who arrive on floating clouds. This piece was produced under the short-lived Southern Ming dynasty, a remnant court that fled to the south after the Qing dynasty had been established in the north. Dated ceramics from the Southern Ming are extremely rare."
"""Cloth_of_Gold""_with_Medallions","This exuberant textile illustrates one of the most luxurious materials used at the Mongol court: nasij, or “cloth of gold.” Except for very fine outlines of patterns in bright red silk, the entire surface of this special textile was woven with gold threads. An innovation from Central Asia, this technique attests to the mass movement of weavers from the eastern Iranian world to China during the Mongol period."
Theatrical_warrior’s_jacket_with_dragons,"This type of jacket was usually worn by a performer playing a Manchu general. The ceremonial armor worn during parades and inspections inspired its form.On view during Rotation 1 of exhibition from June 25, 2016 through January 13, 2017."
Vase_with_children_at_play_and_scholars_in_gathering,"A new technique featuring shading effects, adapted from the method of painting enamel on copper alloy, replaced solid-colored styles and became the mainstream for porcelain decoration in the eighteenth century. Here, the children’s faces have the subtle gradation characteristic of this style, and their clothing is detailed in a wide variety of hues."
Birds_among_flowering_branches_against_clouds,"In this exuberant composition, various birds and plants are juxtaposed with cloud formations in colorful combinations. This tapestry was probably part of a larger decorative panel with hundreds of birds and a phoenix, a symbol of a group of loyal officials with a righteous ruler."
Bodhisattva_Guanyin,"Bodhisattvas are usually adorned as royalty, with heavy jewelry, layered silk robes, and elaborate headdresses. At the center of Guanyin’s crown sits a cross-legged Buddha, the celestial Buddha Amitabha of the Western Paradise, from whose forehead Guanyin is said to have first emerged. The vase in Guanyin’s hands often appears in depictions of the bodhisattva in two special forms: White-Robed and Water-Moon Guanyin."
Dragon_Roundel_from_a_Ceremonial_Garment,"This piece, from a set of four roundels, decorated the chest, back, and shoulders of a prince’s formal ceremonial garment. Each roundel bears a dragon-in-clouds pattern on a navy blue ground, and seven of the eight auspicious Buddhist symbols appear in the clouds around the edges—the canopy, endless knot, fish, lotus, umbrella, vase, and wheel. (Only the conch is missing.) The roundels for the chest and the back feature a frontal dragon (zheng long), while those for the shoulders show a dragon in motion (xing long) with its head in profile.The emperor’s formal ceremonial garment is decorated in the same way, except that all four dragons appear frontally."
Top_of_a_bridge_pin,"This sumptuous gilt bronze ornament in the shape of a mountain with wild animals would have decorated one of the tuning pegs that hold strings of a se, a plucked string instrument popular during the Zhou and Han dynasties. The numerous small holes on the piece served to attach it to the wooden peg. Comparable examples have been found in the tombs of the King of Nanyue, in Guangzhou, Guangdong, and the King of Jiangdu at Da Yun Shan, in Xuyi, Jiangsu."
Laozi_crossing_the_Han_Pass,"Carved in deep relief, this object depicts Laozi, the celebrated founder of Daoism, on his way to visit Xi Wang Mu, the Queen Mother of the West. She rides on a floating cloud while awaiting his arrival."
Bowl_with_Eight_Immortals_of_the_Wine_Cup,"The figures depicted on this bowl are eminent men of letters from the eighth century who shared a love of wine. Celebrated in a poem by Du Fu (712–770), “Song for the Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup,” they include the poet Li Bai and the calligrapher Zhang Xu."
Box_with_pommel_scroll_design,"The box’s base bears an incised mark of Yang Mao (active 14th century), one of the most famous lacquer masters in China. Historical texts indicate that Yang specialized in carved red lacquer, but no further detailed archival records survive to attribute any particular work to this artist. The skillful carving and design of this box suggest it was from the time of the artist, if not by his hand."
Figure_of_a_gentleman,"This unusual sculpture portrays a gentleman wearing a long braid and an unadorned robe with a low-cut, folded collar, a Manchu style popular during the Qing dynasty. In addition to his imposing posture, the figure’s facial expression conveys a sense of self-confidence. Polished to evoke the texture of soft silk, his finely carved robe imparts realism to the sculpture. Although the figure’s identity is unrecorded, the sculpture is likely a portrait after a real person for a family memorial."
"Magnolia,_crabapple,_and_tree_peony","The plants on this embroidery evoke an auspicious rebus, or multipart visual pun: magnolia (yulan 玉蘭), crabapple (haitang 海棠) and peony (nicknamed fugui 富貴) combine to mean “fortune in the jade hall” (yutang fugui 玉堂富貴), a wish for riches and honor."
"Panel_with_dragon,_phoenix,_and_peonies","This vivid silk tapestry, lavishly embellished with gold thread, depicts a coiling dragon rising through clouds above mountains and waves. A colorful phoenix flies over blooming peonies, a garden rock, and a magic mushroom—all symbols of an age of peace and prosperity."
Bowl_imitating_carved_lacquer,"The decoration depicting bats flying over waves on this porcelain bowl was molded to imitate carved lacquer, and it exhibits the same depth and richness as other lacquers from the eighteenth century. The closest parallels to the bowl’s shape can be found in small wooden dishes with metal rims from Tibet and Mongolia, which were sometimes placed on altars to hold flowers or other offerings. It is possible that this dish was also intended to serve a ceremonial function, or as a gift for a foreign dignitary."
Calligraphy_Couplet,"Rare spotted bamboo serves as the background for apoetic couplet embroidered in blue silk threads wrappedaround bamboo slats. The poem reads:The green paulownias are as clear as a spotlessreputation,The heavenly dew as lustrous as literary pearls."
Immortals_of_Harmony_and_Happiness,"These two figures are known as the Immortals of Harmony and Happiness (He-He Erxian). According to legend, they were originally two monks, Hanshan and Shide, who resided in the Guoqing Monastery, on the Tiantai Mountain, Zhejiang Province, during the Tang dynasty (618–907). They later became immortalized in folklore and were widely accepted as symbols of harmony and long-lasting friendship."
Brush_Holder,"This brush holder illustrates scenes from the famous poem “Ode to the Pavilion of the Inebriated Old Man” by Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072). Demoted in 1045 to the remote Anhui Province, Ouyang took solace in wine and the natural world. Carving with supreme skill from a massive piece of bamboo, the artist exploited the potential of the different layers of the plant’s flesh to create varied textural and pictorial effects."
Luohan,"This powerful depiction of a luohan (arhat, in Sanskrit), one of the disciples of the Buddha, shows the same finely drawn, highly colored figure style found in the Ten Kings of Hell (in this case), confirming its origin in the Zhejiang city of Ningbo, where workshops specialized in painting Buddhist images during the Southern Song and Yuan periods."
Star_deities_of_the_northern_and_central_dippers,"This depiction of Daoist deities was once part of a set of paintings used in the Buddhist water-and-land ritual and commissioned by the emperor, as attested to by the inscription in the lower left: ""By imperial order, directed and supervised by the senior eunuchs of the Directorate of the Imperial Household Service, Shang Yi, Wang Qin, and others."" The identity of the deities is given in a second inscription, written in gold, along the right-hand margin: ""Portrait of the Northern Dipper, Central Dipper, and Root Destiny Star Lords.""According to the scholar Shawn Eichman, there are five ""dipper"" constellations in Daoist astronomy, with the Central Dipper as the leader and the Northern Dipper responsible for removing names from the records of death. In this depiction, the seven star gods of the Central Dipper are shown in the lower register wearing regal robes and crowns, while the nine stars of the Northern Dipper, including two hidden stars, wear less formal robes and occupy the middle register. Eichman identifies the small figure with two attendants at the upper right as the Root Destiny Officer, who descends to earth to accept offerings on the cyclical anniversary of each person's birth (see Stephen Little with Shawn Eichman, Taoism and the Arts of China [Chicago: The Art Institute of Chicago, 2000], p. 248)."
Square_dish_with_long-tailed_birds_and_camellias,"Made in a classic two-bird design, this dish is representative of the style of the early fourteenth century. The lacquer artist achieved a nearly three-dimensional image on a flat surface: deep carving creates the relief effect, and fine incisions for the bird feathers and leaf veins convey texture. The red background is relatively visible compared to examples made later in the century."
Ink_Tablet_with_Tang_Mirror_Design,"Woodblock illustrations were an important source of decorative designs during the late Ming and Qing dynasties. The eight-lobed, foliated Tang mirror decorating this octagonal ink cake was borrowed from an illustration in the Xinqing gujian (Catalogue of Xiqing Antiques), a compilation of the antiques collected in the Qing palace. A fictitious mark of Fang Yulu was added to this ink cake to increase its value."
Octagonal_box_with_“dragon_pine”,"The designer of this box transformed the pine tree into a fanciful dragon, symbol of the emperor. This combination probably expressed a wish that the emperor live as long as the pine, an emblem of longevity. The box was made with the same technique as the adjacent dragon dish, and they bear identical dated marks, which implies that they were made in the same imperial workshop, if not by the same hands."
Tray_with_Daoist_figures,"The eight figures assembled on the riverbank represent the Eight Immortals, a group of Daoist deities who originated from the legends of the Tang dynasty (618–907). They can each be identified by their personal attributes, including the flute, staff, sword, flower, and gourd. Here, they await the arrival of Shoulao, God of Longevity, who is flying above the waves on the back of a crane. Daoism gained increasing popularity in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and so did its imagery. This exquisitely decorated tray is a remarkable example."
Box_in_the_shape_of_an_archaic_jade_she,"The shape of this box is derived from a type of jade pendant (she) with an oval interior and pointed end that was produced during the Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 220). The six dragons prowling across the surface of this box are more stylized than Han-era examples, however. Their tails are depicted as ribbons, which is typical for designs from the eighteenth century."
Male_attendant_holding_a_bird,"This foreign gentleman of the hunt, or falconer, wears a Western Asian-style long coat with wide lapels and Western Asian-style boots. His elaborate tall fitted hat is characteristic of Central Asian headgear."
Guanyin_as_the_Nine-Lotus_Bodhisattva,"In the summer of 1586, nine lotus flowers in the Ming imperial palace issued double blooms, a rare occurrence that was seen as an auspicious omen. That the flowers bloomed in the residence of the Empress Dowager Cisheng, mother of the emperor, was particularly favorable, for Cisheng was a devout Buddhist who had dreamed of her own incarnation as Guanyin. This painting is one of several Cisheng commissioned to celebrate the occasion. The composition, which places the boy pilgrim Shancai (Sudhana, in Sanskrit) before a maternal bodhisattva in a palace setting, strongly suggests that we are meant to see Cisheng as Guanyin. The square red seals in the upper left belong to Cisheng and her son, Emperor Wanli."
Phoenix_headed_amphora,"The shape of either Western Asian or Central Asian metalwork could have provided the model for this Tang-dynasty earthenware ewer. However, the attachment of its elongated handle to the mouth rim rather than the body indicates a Central Asian—specifically, Sogdian—prototype. The mounted archer shooting over his shoulder, the so-called ""Parthian shot,"" can be found in the Western ornamental lexicon."
Dish_with_an_immortal_on_raft,"The scene on this dish represents the diplomat and expeditioner Zhang Qian (164–113 B.C.), who led the Han imperial envoy to the Western Regions. Legend has it that when Zhang attempted to find the source of the Yellow River he sailed his raft into the Milky Way. The figure here confidently sits on a single log in a relaxed posture amid turbulent waves."
"Door_frame_tile_with_elephant_from_the_""Porcelain_Pagoda""","To commemorate his parents, the Yongle emperor commissioned the construction of the Proclaiming Grace Temple (Bao'en si) in Nanjing. The temple's most prominent landmark was its ""porcelain pagoda,"" a nine-story structure some 260 feet in height that was surfaced in colorful glazed ceramic tiles. The pagoda was destroyed in 1856 during the Taiping Rebellion, so that only fragments, including this elephant tile, have survived."
Leys_Jar,Auspicious dragons chase flaming pearls around the neck and body of this vessel. The motif and the reign mark on the base of the jar indicate that the work was intended for use in the imperial court. Such small jars with flared necks were used to collect used tea leaves and table scraps.
Western_Paradise_of_Buddha_Amitabha,"Buddha Amitabha in his Western Paradise is depicted here as Buddha Amitayus of Infinite Life. Crowned and surrounded by bodhisattvas, monks, and disciples, he holds a vase of longevity in his hands. The title, written horizontally above the image, reads, “Picture of the adornments of [the two kinds of] circumstantial and direct [retributions] in the world of ultimate bliss in the West.”Below the garden-palace complex in the background, the souls of devotees emerge from lotus flowers to be reborn in Paradise, also known as the Pure Land."
Ewer_with_peacock_and_peonies,"This brightly painted porcelain ewer illustrates a vivid cross-medium exchange of artistic design during the sixteenth century. The form is based on a metal wine ewer, while the bright red enamel embellished with golden birds and flowers is clearly inspired by luxury lacquer ware. The turquoise-blue enamel resembles similar colors commonly found on cloisonné and adds a fresh touch to the red-gold surface."
Buddhist_monk_Budai,"Budai, a tenth-century monk, was known for his laughing face and round stomach. Named after the cloth sack (budai) that he carries under his arm, he is believed to be the incarnation of Maitreya, the future Buddha, who helps common people in the mortal world.The porcelain of the Dehua kilns in Fujian Province is characterized by its thick, lustrous, clear glaze and white paste. It is generally referred to in Western writings as blanc de chine or “China white.”"
Textile_with_Swan_Hunt,"Hunting swans with a falcon was an important annual autumnal event for nomadic people such as the Jurchen rulers of the Jin dynasty, one of several rulers who controlled much of northern China from the tenth to the fourteenth century. Illustrations of this important seasonal event are found in textiles, jade, and ceramics. Historical texts record that Jurchen noblemen wore green silk robes with this motif during hunts. This piece is perhaps a fragment from such a robe."
Plaque_with_dragons,"This exquisite plaque features detailed relief carvings of five sinuous dragons amid stylized clouds. Not satisfied merely to reproduce an existing design, the artist enhanced the motif’s visual appeal by articulating novel attributes for the five dragons, including long, elephantlike snouts, single long horns, feline heads, and even beaks resembling those of an eagle."
Dish_with_Flowers_and_Birds,The inscription written on the base both gives a date and indicates that this piece was commissioned for the court.
Bottle,"The twisted shape of the vertical lobes that define this bottle, and the density of the decoration, suggest that it was made for the Japanese market. The inscription on the lower section of the vessel is a paean to diligence and to the importance of scholarship at court."
Azure_Cliff_with_Red_Maples,"A solitary figure with a walking staff stands atop a low cliff contemplating a mountain vista. This scene of human encounter with nature is accompanied by a verse by the celebrated Tang-dynasty poet Du Fu (712–770), inscribed by the painter:The azure cliff catches the breeze, a lone cloud thin,Red maples, their backs to the sun, ten thousand trees dense.—Translation by Stephen Owen"
Landscape_after_Guo_Xi,"This is an early work by C.C. Wang, painted while the artist and collector still lived in China. Though his later paintings show an attempt to adapt the training of his youth to twentieth century purposes, this painting shows him studiously channeling tradition, revealing a mastery of the brush idiom of the late eleventh-century landscapist Guo Xi (ca. 1000-ca. 1090); the majestic pines with “crab-claw” hooked branches, bold, wavy contour lines for rocks, and wavy texture strokes for rocks are hallmarks of this manner."
Chime_(Qing)_for_Linzhong_(8th_note_in_the_12-note_scale),"The manufacture of sonorous stones for decoration or music from carved or cut jade may be traced to the end of the late Eastern Zhou period (ca. 771–221 B.C.) and followed in a tradition of L-shaped stone chimes known from about 1700 B.C. The great importance of sonorous substances such as wood and stone among the percussion instruments of East Asia stems from the religious belief that, through this vibrating matter, nature itself speaks to the human ear. Highly polished slabs were decorated with tiger, lion, or dragon motifs."
The_Kitchen_God,"In China an image of the Kitchen God is pasted above stoves to observe all activities in the house. At the New Year the image is burned, and the god returns to heaven to report to the Jade Emperor, who rules the universe. His testimony would determine the family’s fortunes in the coming year.In this print the haloed Kitchen God and his wife sit formally behind an altar. They are flanked by two youths holding jars marked “good” and “evil,” into which they will cast counters for each good and evil deed carried out during the year. The inscribed couplet reads:Ascend to Heaven and report nice things;Return to your palace and bestow good luck."
Incense_Burner_with_Dragons_Chasing_Pearl,The inscription written on the outside of the lip indicates that the jar was offered by members of the Wu family to the Temple of the Lord of the Black Heaven in order to protect the peace of the family and the home in 1564. The Lord of the Black Heaven is one of the many quasi-historical immortals found in Daoist traditions.
Playing_the_zither_for_a_crane,"In a landscape of his own design, a man plays music for his pet crane beneath a massive paulownia tree. Within this tightly curated microcosm, the fantastic rocks stand in for mountain ranges, the man-made pond for an ocean, and the foliage for dense forests, creating a safe and placid representation of nature for the enjoyment of a privileged elite."
Headstone_from_a_Sarcophagus,"The headstone of this sarcophagus is embellished with an acting troupe poised to perform on the balcony of a two-story building. The side panels feature narrative scenes illustrating twenty-four stories of filial piety. A very similar set of engraved illustrations was discovered on the sarcophagus of Pan Dechong (1191–1256), who was buried in 1260 on the grounds of the Yongle Palace, a famous Daoist temple located in southwestern Shanxi Province. Pan was a leading member of the Quanzhen sect of northern Daoism, which advocated the importance of filial behavior, so it is not surprising that the Confucian theme of filial paragons was adopted to decorate his sarcophagus. The significance of the theatrical troupe is still unclear.These narrative scenes are a popular manifestation of the subject matter and fine-line drawing style of the scholar-artist Li Gonglin (ca. 1041–1106), particularly his Classic of Filial Piety of around 1085. Li's masterpiece gave contemporary relevance to this canonical Confucian subject through a new expressive style of calligraphic brushwork as well as through the creation of a new set of illustrations that offered subtle commentaries on contemporary political and moral questions. The sarcophagus, which may be dated roughly two hundred years later, shows the widespread impact of Li's thematic concerns and drawing style on popular art forms"
Tray_with_pommel_scrolls,Layers of black lacquer applied between the red ones enhance this tray’s surface appearance and contribute to the vivacity of the scroll design.
Dish_with_characters_for_longevity_and_health_(shou_kang),"Auspicious characters in stylized archaic script became extremely popular in sixteenth-century Ming decorative art. The two characters in the center, for longevity (shou) and health (kang), illustrate a blessing wish. The artist nearly merged them into a single character in an ornamental and playful way."
Pair_of_dishes_with_peonies_and_lotuses,"Carved-lacquer dishes, such as these decorated using a laborious and expensive technique, were probably never meant for dining. Instead, they were displayed or used to offer guests items such as confections. The deep, dense carving of the lacquer shows an artistic combination of tree peonies and lotuses."
Square_tray_with_birds_in_a_garden,"This complicated decorative composition features two pairs of pheasants and sparrows and a background of fruit trees, flowers, and a stylized rock, a sign of an upscale garden. These motifs represent wishes for longevity, riches, and worldly success. The lacquer is built of red layers over yellow ones, and the artist carved to varying depths to expose the colors. An interest in bright color combinations, also found in ceramics and textiles, characterizes the art of the late Ming dynasty."
Lotus_and_waterbirds,"Imported from India, the lotus—growing from the slime of a pond, its blossoms blooming unsullied—was linked to Buddhist images of purity and rebirth. By the thirteenth century, naturalistic depictions of lotus in different seasons also evoked the ephemeral nature of physical beauty. This large-scale decorative work is by a professional painter of the Piling School, situated near Changzhou, Jiangsu Province. The midsummer scene (on the right) shows lotus flowers in early stages of budding and bloom, while the autumnal scene (on the left) shows its later stages: petals falling, leaves turning brown, and seed pods ripening. The newly sprouted water reeds of midsummer also contrast with the late-blooming water plant and the smartweed that has gone to seed, while the busy activity of a pair of ducks skimming the water for food on the right is juxtaposed with two egrets resting quietly on the left."
Dish_with_dragon,"Several complex techniques were used to create this design of a dragon flying above rocks and waves. The dragon was first carved and then filled with gold and colored lacquers. The resulting decoration, which extended above the surface of the dish, was ground down until it was flush and then polished to an even finish."
Box_with_peonies,"Frequently depicted in carved lacquer, peonies are an important symbol for honor, rank, royalty, and wealth. This box bears additional flowers along the sides: camellias, chrysanthemums, pomegranates, and tree peonies. It is one of several pieces in The Met collection with a six-character mark carved on the bottom reading “Made during the reign of the Yongle emperor” (Da Ming Yongle nian zhi). The use of marks like this, seen more commonly on ceramics, began in the early fifteenth century and continued in all media into the twentieth. Works so marked were likely produced for the court."
Box_with_dragons_in_clouds,"The front-facing dragon on this box’s lid continues a late Ming-period tradition of depicting dragons frontally. In addition to the reign mark on the base, a title mark describes the piece as a “cloud-and-dragon treasure box” (yunlong baohe); its inclusion in the inscription reflects a new practice that appeared in the imperial workshop of the Qianlong period."
"Samyutagama_Sutra,_chapter_25,_from_the_Jinsushan_Tripitaka","Sutra writing developed its own distinctive tradition of regular script in which individual characters retained the squat, fleshy proportions and compact strokes of early clerical script. In this scroll, comprising 325 columns of standard script, the emphatic thickening of vertical strokes also reflects the scribe’s knowledge of the Tang calligrapher Yan Zhenqing (709–785).Although the scroll is traditionally dated to the Tang dynasty (618–907), a Song date is confirmed by its provenance. The first line of text identifies the scroll’s place of origin as the Guanghui Monastery, a Chan (Zen) Buddhist temple in Zhejiang Province noted for its fine handwritten sutras and high-quality paper. The temple was renamed Guanghui (“boundless kindness”) in 1008, so the scroll cannot date before that year. Since Yan Zhenqing’s style was especially popular during the early Song, the scroll may be dated stylistically to the eleventh century."
Gourd-Shaped_Bottle,"Gourd-shaped vessels were popular in the Ming imperial court in the sixteenth century, especially in the Jiajing period, when the emperor was known for his fervent interest in Daoism. Gourds and bottles in their shape were thought to hold the elixir of immortality for Daoist deities. The shapes, colors, and textures of gourds seemingly appealed to Moore and his design staff, who made a number of vessels that take their shape or feature them as decoration."
Bowl_with_“Oil-Spot”_Design,"Although kilns operating in south China are most often associated with the elegant black glaze wares treasured in Japan for use in the tea ceremony, ceramics of this type were also produced in the north among the numerous popular kilns that are classified as Cizhou kilns."
Tea_Bowl_with_“Hare’s-Fur”_Decoration,"Famed throughout China, Jian wares were also exported to Japan, often by Buddhist monks who had visited monasteries in the nearby center at Mount Tianmu. As a result, ceramics with this type of decoration are known in Japan as tenmoku, after the Japanese reading of the name of the mountain. Tenmoku glazes continue to play an important role in Western pottery today."
Poetic_couplet,The couplet embroidered on these two panels suggests they were meant for the birthday celebration of an official who earned great honors from the imperial court

"Rectangular_tray_with_fish_chime,_treasures,_and_clouds","The two fish on this tray are suspended from a pendant in the shape of an ancient stone chime, which represents wishes for happiness and abundance (yuqing). The twin fish is also one of the eight Buddhist treasures—the other seven are arranged in the foreground: a wheel, conch shell, umbrella, parasol, flower, jar, and double knot. Shown with bats and clouds, these symbols convey auspicious wishes beyond religious meaning."
Rank_Badge_with_Crane,"The Qing government generally adopted the earlier Ming system of rank badges, with the exception of some minor changes in the choice of animals. The crane on this badge corresponds to the highest civil rank."
Rank_Badge_with_Lion,"During the Ming dynasty, the audience robes of government officials bore insignia designating rank. While different birds represented civil ranks, military ranks were represented by a variety of real and mythical quadrupeds. The lion, as seen on this badge, symbolizes the highest military rank."
Brush_holder_with_“Ode_to_the_Pavilion_of_the_Inebriated_Old_Man”,"A tour de force of carving skill, the design on this brush holder is cut from the lighter skin of the bamboo so that it stands in relief against the darker, fibrous stalk. The subject is a gathering hosted by Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) in 1045. Ouyang later composed an ode to commemorate the event, and to poke fun at himself for being both the eldest and the most easily intoxicated of the guests."
Platter_with_the_story_of_Pan_An,"This large platter exemplifies typical wucai (five-color) ware from the Kangxi period, a golden age of enameled porcelain. The era saw the developed of unprecedented fresh hues and rich varieties of enamel, including the recently invented overglaze blue. The platter most likely depicts the talented writer Pan An (247–300) being showered with fruit. Unusually, the cart pulled by a goat refers to another handsome young man Wei Jie (286–312), even though he is not associated with fruit. The ceramic artist freely combined the tales into a composite scene."
Dragon_medallion,Official Ming-dynasty records document that members of the imperial family wore robes decorated with medallions of dragons.The vibrant colors and dense design of this roundel reflect late Ming court taste.
Brush_Holder_with_Literary_Gathering,"Famous historical literary gatherings were a favorite subject in painting and the decorative arts. The party on this rare silver brush holder may allude to the Gathering in the Western Garden, a legendary assembly of literary luminaries held in the city of Kaifeng in 1087."
Box_with_pommel_scrolls,"The decoration covering the surface of this box is sometimes known as a pommel-scroll design because it resembles the shape of sword’s pommel. A flowering plum tree and crescent moon made of ivory, gold leaf, lacquer, and glass, are inlaid into the interior of the cover. The motif may allude to any number of earlier poems that evoke the shadows of plum blossoms by moonlight in a night filled with their scent."
Couplet,"This couplet was brushed by the prominent collector and painter C. C. Wang, who immigrated to the United States from China in 1949 and settled in New York. Paintings from Wang’s collection form the core of The Met’s holdings of premodern Chinese painting and calligraphy. The verse, adapted from a poem by the Song dynasty polymath Su Shi (1037–1101), describes a spare vignette from the recluse’s life:Clear water, protruding stones, one can count the fish;Dense bamboo, deep within, a bird calls."

Sutra_Cover,"Luxury silk features prominently in covers of Buddhist sutras commissioned by the Ming court. Ornamental patterns on these textiles often reflect a standard design from the imperial workshop. Here, colorful flower scrolls are rendered in the same style as those found on imperial cloisonné enamel and ceramics."

Theatrical_armor_with_dragons,"This garment is part of a set of costume armor based on the style of the eighteenth-century Manchu Qing court. The lining bears a rectangular stamp reading “used by the Grand Theater,” which indicates that it was worn by performers in the Forbidden City. The exceptional tapestry work depicting five-clawed dragons, a symbol of the emperor, further confirms the robe’s imperial palace origin.On view during Rotation 1 of exhibition from June 25, 2016 through January 13, 2017."
"Chrysanthemums,_Rocks,_and_Grasses_Representing_Autumn;_from_Set_of_Four_Panels_Representing_the_Four_Seasons","Set of four panels, see 62.97.31-.34"
Panel_with_Longevity_(Shou)_Characters,"Writing the character for longevity (shou) in one hundred different forms has a long tradition in China. The earliest example, a stone carving dated 1229, still survives in Guangxi Province, and highly stylized examples are found in all media from later dynasties. Here, the character shou is reproduced in ten different forms, and the purported source for each form is given above in smaller characters. These panels may have once been part of a set of ten hangings with one hundred such characters. Although the gold thread has abraded, it’s not hard to imagine how marvelous and luminous this work would have been when it was displayed within the original set at a luxurious birthday celebration."
Panel_with_Landscape,"The scenes on these two panels depict magnificent gardens within green hills overlooking bodies of water. Although we cannot accurately identify them, the buildings and scenery are comparable to those found in eighteenth-century woodblock illustrations of the Old Summer Palace in Beijing and the Mountain Resort in Chengde. It seems likely that these two pieces were once part of a series representing imperial retreats."
Rank_Badge_with_Silver_Pheasant,"The silver pheasant corresponds to the fifth civil rank. Conventionally in rank badges, the silver pheasant is represented in white with five serrated tail feathers. Occasionally the usual five are augmented with some thin parallel plumes, here shown in red, shading to pink and white.The gold of the waves is rendered in couching, the most common technique for embroidering with gold thread. In couching, the gold thread is laid on the surface and affixed to the foundation fabric with occasional stitches that do not obscure the gold."

It seems likely that these two pieces were once part of a series representing imperial retreats."
Two_Pheasants_on_a_Rock,"While at first glance this picture of pheasants and a distant landscape looks like a painting, it is actually silk tapestry (kesi). Beginning in the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279) and continuing into the late Qing, faithful reproductions of paintings were made in kesi. By contrast, tapestry-woven silks with decorative patterns were produced for clothing and furnishings. By the nineteenth century, kesipictures show a change in technique: large areas are tapestry-woven in a single color and then details painted in. Here, for example, the river is a single area with painted waves and ripples. (From China, 1800–1900 A.D.)"
Chair_Strip_with_Cranes_and_Lantern,"This chair strip was appropriate for multiple occasions. Textiles with lantern patterns were frequently used as seasonal decorations for celebrations of the annual Lantern Festival, which occurs on the night of the first full moon of the Lunar New Year. The generally auspicious crane motif is associated with both longevity and career success. It also serves as the symbol for the highest rank of civil officials."
Wrist_rest_with_kingfisher_and_lotus,The pairing of the kingfisher bird and the lotus is symbolic of summer. The motif appears in paintings as well as in three-dimensional art. Rests such as this were used while writing or painting to support the wrist and ensure the proper placement of the brush.
Rank_Badge_with_Wild_Goose,"The wild goose on this badge corresponds to the fourth rank of civil officials. This square is a fine example of an exquisite tradition in rank badges that developed in the eighteenth century. The bird is shown in a delicately delineated landscape complete with trees, flowers, rocks, waves, and flowing water. Some painted detail is included—for example, the dots on the light-green grass in the foreground."
Brush_with_plum_blossoms,The plum blossoms at various stages of flowering that decorate this brush are an apt choice for a scholar’s implements. It is a theme often represented in literati painting and lauded in poetry.
Scenic_Sites_in_the_Qianlong_Emperor’s_Southern_Inspection_Tour,"These four tapestry hangings (13.220.134–.137) may be from a larger group depicting the scenic sites that the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1736–95) visited during his historic tours south of the capital. The inscriptions identify these four places as Forest of Springs (Quanlin), Pool of the Ancient School (Panchi), Guangyue Tower (Guangyuelou), and Wuwei Monastery (Wuweiguan), all now in Shandong Province. Aside from Guangyue Tower, the buildings at the other three sites have been destroyed, though the first two are known to have housed auxiliary palaces. The images on these panels are comparable to woodblock illustrations in Nanxun Shengdian, a book published in 1770 to memorize the emperor’s tours."

Vase_with_peony_scroll_and_landscape_panels,"The shape of this vase is common in porcelain but unusual in carved lacquer. Its form reflects the experimentation and exchange that characterized the decorative arts in China in the eighteenth century. Unlike most carved lacquer objects, which have a wood substructure, this heavy vessel probably has a support of metal, such as brass or copper."
Sutra_cover_with_phoenixes_amid_flowers,Sutra cover with repeating pattern of phoenixes among flowers; gold metallic thread on a red background. Silk satin with supplementary-weft patterning in metallic thread.
Set_of_boxes,"The smaller painted and gilded boxes nestled into this carved container were intended to hold treasured items. Although sets like this one were popular, it is unusual to find an outer box and its smaller components together."
Carpet,"Ningxia carpets came to the attention of the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662–1722) during a journey to the western provinces in 1696–97, and in the early part of the Qing dynasty, a number of Ningxia carpets were ordered for audience halls in the palace. This carpet contains elements often found in high-quality Ningxia carpets: curvilinear and geometric renderings of dragons, a swastika-like fret as seen in the border, and the characteristic outer edge of grayish brown."
Ruyi_scepter_with_poem_composed_by_the_Qianlong_Emperor,"This scepter was fashioned from bamboo veneer, a special technique where the exterior layer of a bamboo stalk is used to create a soft and smooth appearance resembling boxwood. Such works were popular in the imperial workshop because of their appeal to the Qianlong Emperor. The back of this scepter was incised with a poem composed by the emperor in appreciation of the bamboo scepter as an ideal literati object: “[The bamboo scepter] loves to stay where only witty conversa-tion takes place, and feels like meeting real gentlemen.”"
Rock-form_ornament_with_poem_composed_by_the_Qianlong_Emperor,"This unusual “rock” was carved from a pale-green jade boulder to resemble a highly appreciated type of scholar’s rock from Lake Tai. The scalloped surface on such rocks is shaped over a long time by underwater erosion. The flat surface of the top corner is incised with the Qianlong Emperor’s poem, dated spring 1757, expressing his wonder at the strange form of the rock and connecting it with another famous scenic spot, Feilai Hill, or Peak Flew Hither, in Hangzhou."
Album_of_Illustrated_Cotton_Production_and_poems_composed_by_the_Qianlong_Emperor,"In 1765, Fang Guancheng (1698–1768), viceroy of Zhili (present-day Hebei province), presented the Qianlong Emperor with a set of sixteen paintings of cotton production. Recognizing the series as an important achievement of local agriculture, the emperor composed poems for each of the paintings. The images and poems became designs for imperial works of art in various media, including jade, porcelain, and ink cake. This jade album is a concise version that combines the original sixteen paintings into ten pages."
Brush_holder_with_scene_from_Investiture_of_the_Gods,"This vessel depicts a narrative scene from Investiture of the Gods (Fengshen Yanyi), a sixteenth-century mythological novel. On one side, deities surround a fierce, open-mouthed tiger, and on the other, three figures representing Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism—Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning (Yuanshi Tianzun), Buddha, and Confucius—sit in front of bamboo groves."
Twelve-lobed_covered_box,"Lacquer boxes with lobed sides and pewter trim are typical of Yuan-dynasty artwork. Many were fitted with an interior tray that probably held cosmetics, combs, hairpins, and other adornments. This box represents a creative design that transforms a twelve-petal flower form into an elongated oval."
One_of_a_pair_of_lamps_with_archaic-style_calligraphy,"The removable sides of the lamps are jade plaques in carved wood frames, each inscribed at the top with a group of nine characters that can be read in any order. The various readings are transcribed in the middle of the plaques in different fanciful ""archaic"" scripts, with a note at the bottom giving the supposed source and date of each particular script. The main frame of the lamps are of zitan, a fine grained hardwood, and the ornaments are of boxwood an ivory.(One of a pair; see 20015.500.5.2)"

Theatrical_robe_with_phoenix_and_floral_patterns,"This elaborate robe would have been worn by a performer playing a princess or a palace concubine. Details such as the elegant cloud collar, multicolored sleeves, and fine embroidery attest to the quality of the garment and the status of the role. Phoenixes were used to signify the empress and other women at court. The dangling ribbons of the skirt would have moved as the actor was walking or dancing.A depiction of a “princess” wearing a similar robe in a nineteenth-century album of theatrical portraits (at the National Library of China, Beijing) helped to date this piece and confirm its function.On view during Rotation 1 of exhibition from June 25, 2016 through January 13, 2017."
Woman’s_Festival_Robe,"The golden five-clawed dragons on this robe indicate that it was woven for an empress or imperial consort of lower rank. While it retains the imagery mandated in the mid-eighteenth century court regulations, changes in the rendering of these designs help date this robe to the late nineteenth century. The heads of the dragons appear swollen and disproportionate to the bodies, and their claws have lost their strength. The standard rock and waves pattern at the hem have also changed. The diagonal waves are longer, straighter, and less realistic. These stylistic changes parallel those found on other works of art made at the same time."
Theatrical_robe_for_a_Buddhist_priest,"This type of robe, known as a kasaya and intended for a Buddhist priest, is a piece of rectangular fabric that is wrapped over an inner robe and fastened in the front with a hook. The lining of this example bears a stamp that reads “Used in the Grand Theatre (Daxiji yong),” which indicates the robe was worn by an actor in the imperial theater in the Forbidden City rather than by an actual priest."
Foliated_dish_with_four_birds_and_flowers,"This dish is an excellent example of a small group of carved black lacquers that feature a four-bird motif. In this example, four birds fly amid a dense array of blossoming peonies. This design evolved from a “two-bird” motif that first appeared during the late thirteenth century. Demanding extraordinary carving skills, these vessels create a nearly three-dimensional visual across a basically flat surface. The even more complex design featuring four or five birds, as here, began to appear on lacquers of the fifteenth century."
Covered_box_with_figures_in_a_garden,"This circular box is a classic example of carved red lacquer from the early Ming imperial workshop. Intricate diaper patterns differentiate the sky, water, and terrace, and the meticulous carving and elegant design are hallmarks of the finest quality carved lacquers from this period. A garden scene framed by a foreground rockery is seen on the cover, where a scholar seated by an elegant hall looks out over a pond of blossoming lotus while his youthful attendant prepares tea. The scene recalls the famous Song-dynasty scholar and legendary lotus-lover Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073)."
"Fan_Surface_with_a_Dragon,_Clouds,_and_Waves","During the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368), on the occasion of the Duanwu Festival (the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, now celebrated as the Dragon Boat Festival), the ministry of rites would present to the imperial court fans made of silk tapestry (kesi) with various pictorial subjects, including dragons in clouds. This fan surface, with a dragon breathing out a flaming pearl above waves, is a vestige of that tradition. The woven inscription indicates that it was a gift to a brother-in-law."
Jar,"An inscription, chang ming fu gui (""long life, riches, and honor""), has been painted in red enamel over the incised reign mark on the base."
Rank_Badge_with_Bats_(no_insignia),"This rank badge bears no rank insignia, that is, no bird or animal denoting the civil or military rank of the wearer. However, it does have a ring of bats encircling the empty space where the insignia belongs. In China bats were considered an auspicious pattern because the word for ""bat"" is similar in sound to the word for ""happiness""."
Sutra_cover_with_dragons_and_phoenixes_amid_clouds,"Luxury silk features prominently in covers of Buddhist sutras commissioned by the Ming court. Ornamental patterns on these textiles often reflect a standard design from the imperial workshop. Here, dragons, phoenixes, and auspicious clouds are rendered in the same style as those found on sixteenth-century imperial ceramics and lacquerware."
Archaic-style_vase_with_poem_composed_by_the_Qianlong_Emperor,This massive jade vase is handsomely incised with a poem composed by the Qianlong Emperor in 1773. The poem clearly indicates that the work was based on a Song-dynasty (960–1279) ceramic vase with an unadorned surface. More fascinating is that the jade vase features subtle crackling like that observed on high-quality Song celadon-glazed ware.
Head_of_a_Luohan,"This monumental sculpture likely represents the elderly monk Kashyapa, a direct disciple of the historical Buddha Shakyamuni and one of the original luohans. It was probably once part of a triad along with Shakyamuni and Ananda, another luohan disciple."
Theatrical_jacket_for_a_court_lady,"This jacket features delicate embroidered lotuses on green satin. Known as a lotus-picker jacket (cailianyi), this type of garment would have been worn by a lady while she picked lotuses. On the lining of this example, several ink stamps indicate it was used at the Jingshan, a man-made hill north of the Forbidden City where actors from south China who performed in the imperial theater lived."
Box_with_Daoists_welcoming_immortal_Shoulao,"Boxes in this shape are often fitted with trays that have recesses for holding cups to serve wine at celebrations. The design on this example shows Daoists welcoming Shoulao, the god of longevity, as he descends from the heavens on a crane—apt imagery for a vessel used to mark a birthday and convey wishes for a long life. A historical group of Daoist immortals is seated in the individual cartouches carved on the sides of the box."

A historical group of Daoist immortals is seated in the individual cartouches carved on the sides of the box."
Mirror_case_with_lunar_scene,"In imperial China, scholars from humble backgrounds could attain upward social mobility by passing the civil service examination (held by the state every three years) and becoming a career government official. This achievement was often symbolized as “plucking a branch off the osmanthus tree on the moon” in popular culture. This embroidered silk case depicts the goddess Chang’e who, accompanied by her attendant and rabbit, hands a branch of the tree to the successful scholar."
Column_with_Dragons_and_Inscriptions,"This unusual stone column, although missing its top and base, exemplifies the monuments that lined the aboveground “spirit ways” leading to Eastern Han tombs. An inscription indicates that the column marked the tomb of a local official. Fluted columns were rare in Han-dynasty China and may have been inspired by the columns associated with King Ashoka (ca. 269–232 B.C.) of Mauryan India, a result of contact between the two countries."
Model_of_a_Barn,"This elevated building reflects a popular architectural style in southern China. The wavy surface of the roof evokes the structure and texture of tiles. Engraved pictorial decorations embellish all four facades. Mythical birds, animals, multibranch lamps, and human figures evoke a sacred atmosphere, implying the model’s function as a religious edifice."
Tomb_Gate,"These five stone slabs—a lintel, two posts, and two door panels—stood at the entrance to a tomb. Their decoration was achieved through a combination of carving and painting. Since pigments deteriorate once stones are unearthed and exposed to air, these rare examples permit a look at the full chromatic glory of Han stone carvings.The pictorial program brings together several symbolic needs of the deceased. Two gigantic doorknockers and a pair of bulls protect the tomb against evil. Patterns on the lintel and posts, including the sun, the moon, and auspicious animals, signal the heavenly domain. On the right-hand door, an immortal following a string of clouds stands ready to guide the deceased into Heaven. Taken together, the decoration transforms this tomb gate into the gate of Heaven."
Bowl,"Jade, the most esteemed natural material in ancient China, was sometimes used to copy works in other media. This bowl may have been modeled on similar examples in glass, in particular a type found only in southern coastal China, a center of robust and frequent trade with foreign cultures."
Model_of_a_Dyeing_Workshop,"This miniature stove model takes the form of a rectangular prism with a sloped top. The facade at the taller end of the slope has an arched opening into the fire chamber, which is attended by a worker. The facade on the shorter end has a rectangular vent and is topped by a chimney. Three hearths crown the model, each heating a cauldron tended by two toiling figures. That the workers are stirring and scooping water suggests that this model may have replicated one used in a dyeing workshop."
Dog,"This recumbent dog is captured at a moment of animation: with wide eyes and upright ears, it opens its mouth as though barking, its teeth bared in confrontation. Its compact, hollow body was molded, while its other parts, such as the ears, teeth, and eyes, were sculpted separately and applied to the body. Vividly detailed canines such as this one embodied the animus of a living animal and frequently appeared in burial complexes, where they warded off evil spirits and guarded both the tomb occupant and the material wealth that he or she brought into the afterlife."
Stem_Cup,"This cup represents a rare category of bronzes produced in far southern China, a region that had frequent contact with South and Southeast Asia. Its carved surface decoration and striations reflect the influence of ancient Indian bronzes, while its shape can be traced to Roman glass goblets."
Lamp_with_Sixteen_Branches,"This lamp, one of the most elaborate Han examples of its kind, takes the shape of a tree with sixteen branches. The branches follow two prototypes: one has a crane, and the other, a winged immortal riding a dragon. A gigantic turtle in the lowermost basin carries the trunk on its back. (Both the turtle and the crane were Han symbols of longevity.) Three figures and twenty-five animals populate the mountain-shaped base, whose surface is painted with clouds. The clouds suggest a place high above the human world, thus transforming the lamp into a land of immortality—appropriate imagery for a funerary object such as this."
Model_of_a_Multistory_House,"Comprising thirty-one detachable parts, this architectural model consists of a seven-story main building and a four-story auxiliary building, with a sky bridge connecting the two. A figure carrying a sack of crops enters from the left, while a recumbent watchdog guards the storage complex to the right of the gate. Designed in a funerary context to emulate a full-scale structure, this model hints at the architectural capabilities of the Eastern Han. Multistory buildings were a considerable feat of engineering, and such models may have been deposited in tombs to symbolize the enduring status and power of the deceased."
Ornament_with_Granulated_Decoration,"These two miniature ornaments illustrate the brilliance of Han granulation, a technique imported from the West. The shield-shaped ornament represents a magic hearth. The second piece comprises three knotted shapes known as sheng, a type of lady’s headgear associated with the Mother Queen of the West, the reigning goddess of the immortal realm."
Money_Tree,"This object represents a type of funerary good called a “money tree” (qian shu) or “money-shaking tree” (yao qian shu). In the extant texts, the term “money tree” first appeared in the eighth century A.D. It is, however, unclear if there was any connection between early discoveries and later records. Based on about two hundred examples known to us, the use of money trees in Han China was prevalent in the southwest and was popular from the first to third century A.D."
Pillow,"This pillow was unearthed from a site of the Jingjue state, which once existed at the northwest frontier of China. The fabric illustrates the highly sophisticated technique of five-color woven silk. Although the weave perpetuates an earlier Western Han tradition, the incorporation of more than two or three colors represents an advancement. Also exceptional are the characters interwoven among the stylized clouds. Though fragmentary here, the full inscription reads, “may a marriage between nobles prosper for a thousand autumns and ten thousand years and benefit sons and grandsons”."
Three_Fragments_of_the_Xiping_Steles,"The Xiping Steles are so named for the Han emperor Liu Hong’s second reign, called Xiping, which means bright and peaceful. Undertaken during this time was the nine-year task of editing and codifying the Confucian canon. The finished manuscripts were carved on forty-six stone tablets, which were erected at the imperial university in Luoyang and functioned somewhat like textbooks. The steles were damaged during the wars that followed the fall of the Han. These three fragments are from the Yi Jing (Book of Changes) and Yue Jing (Book of Music), the latter thought to have been lost since the Qin dynasty."
Horse_and_Groom,"After the Han diplomat Zhang Qian (d. 113 B.C.) brought “heavenly horses” back with him from Dawan, an ancient kingdom in modern Uzbekistan, Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 B.C.) ordered two major military campaigns in order to obtain these grand beasts for his cavalry. This large bronze sculpture illustrates one such celebrated horse, characterized by an arching neck, firm legs, and stocky haunches. Its pointed ears and flared nostrils exude vigor. The knot in its tail suggests that the horse formed part of the cavalry, or possibly a ceremonial procession. The groom is also a member of the military, as indicated by the shield on his left arm."
Slips_with_Yi_Li_(Book_of_Etiquette_and_Ceremonial),"The Yi Li (Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial) is one of the five classics of the Confucian canon, the others being the Shi Jing (Book of Songs), Shu Jing (Book of Documents), Yi Jing (Book of Changes), and Chunqiu (Spring and Autumn Annals). Together, the five classics embody the fundamental principles and code of conduct endorsed by the government. Found in a tomb in the northwestern frontier, this wood slip, a common form of document before the advent of paper, illustrates how Confucian teachings prevailed from the heartland to the farthest corners of the empire."
Inscribed_Weight,"Both the weight and the measure are inscribed with the same edict:In the twenty-sixth year (i.e., 221 B.C.), the Emperor completely unified the regional lords of the All-under-Heaven. The black-headed ones (i.e., the common people) were at great peace, and he established the title of “Emperor.” Now he commands the Chief Ministers [Wei] Zhuang and [Wang] Wan. As for the standards, lengths, measures, and rules that are not unified and are doubtful, clarify and unify them all.The inscription demonstrates efforts to unify and standardize systems throughout the Qin Empire, one of the first undertaken by the new regime. Not only did it enable the collection of grain taxes at a uniform rate throughout the conquered territories, but it also communicated to the widest possible audience the legitimacy and authority of the empire.The weight is notable in that it is made of iron, not bronze; only the largest weights in the Qin system were. This example weighs 120 jin, or 1 shi (literally, “stone”). To prevent corruption, Qin officials could not use weights that deviated from state-mandated norms, which was one way of ensuring that people recognized the legitimacy of the Qin regime."
Ornament_with_Granulated_Decoration,"These two miniature ornaments illustrate the brilliance of Han granulation, a technique imported from the West. The shield-shaped ornament represents a magic hearth. The second piece comprises three knotted shapes known as sheng, a type of lady’s headgear associated with the Mother Queen of the West, the reigning goddess of the immortal realm."
Ruler,"The Han government adopted the measurement system of the Qin. The basic unit for length, or chi, equaled approximately 9 inches, or 23 centimeters. Known examples vary slightly in length, from 21.7 to 24.1 centimeters. At the time of its discovery, the present example was more than eight-tenths intact, indicating that it was originally 23.4 centimeters long. Generally, rulers of the Eastern Han period were slightly longer, and the reason for this change remains unknown."
Relief_with_Mythical_Animals,"The decoration on this stone carving represents a land of wonders where immortals and auspicious animals reside. The most salient being is a nine-headed beast with the scaled body of a dragon, visible at the top left. There are various interpretations of this mythical creature. One, based on historical texts, suggests that it is Renhuang (“Human Sovereign”), who according to legend was the third ruler of China."
Inscribed_Measure,"Both the weight and the measure are inscribed with the same edict:In the twenty-sixth year (i.e., 221 B.C.), the Emperor completely unified the regional lords of the All-under-Heaven. The black-headed ones (i.e., the common people) were at great peace, and he established the title of “Emperor.” Now he commands the Chief Ministers [Wei] Zhuang and [Wang] Wan. As for the standards, lengths, measures, and rules that are not unified and are doubtful, clarify and unify them all.The inscription demonstrates efforts to unify and standardize systems throughout the Qin Empire, one of the first undertaken by the new regime. Not only did it enable the collection of grain taxes at a uniform rate throughout the conquered territories, but it also communicated to the widest possible audience the legitimacy and authority of the empire.The weight is notable in that it is made of iron, not bronze; only the largest weights in the Qin system were. This example weighs 120 jin, or 1 shi (literally, “stone”). To prevent corruption, Qin officials could not use weights that deviated from state-mandated norms, which was one way of ensuring that people recognized the legitimacy of the Qin regime."
Staff_with_Bird-Shaped_Finial,"This wood walking staff was found together with ten wood slips that record an imperial edict specifying the privileges afforded to seniors. Topped with a finial in the shape of a partridge, the staff enabled its holder to enter a government office at will and to walk on the side of the road that was otherwise reserved for the emperor. Anyone who dared abuse or take advantage of an elder, the edict decrees, would face criminal charges and severe punishment by the state."
Crossbow_(Modern_Replica),"The crossbow was one variety of long-range, delayed-discharge weapons used in ancient China. The launching mechanism (see ill.), usually cast in bronze, was mounted at the rear of the wood arm. The bow staves were installed crossways at the front. The arrow was nestled lengthwise into the flight groove. While an archer pulls a regular bow using only the strength of his arm, a crossbow calls for the added support of both his foot and back, yielding a more powerful release. Moreover, the delayed discharge allowed for more time to take aim and, therefore, greater precision."
Ten_Arrows,"While bronze arrowheads continued to be used during the Qin dynasty, their shape had evolved considerably from earlier eras. These examples, excavated from the mausoleum complex of the First Emperor of Qin, have a triangular cross section that enhanced the arrow’s penetrative force. Iron arrowheads began to be used in the Western Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 9), gradually replacing bronze ones."
First_half_of_Ten_Thousand_Li_of_the_Yangzi_River,"This handscroll was split into two pieces; this is the first half. Once attributed to the Southern Song court painter Xia Gui, these paintings in fact reflect a later interpretation of the artist’s style. Xia’s subtle brushwork has been magnified in both size and intensity to create a bold, high-contrast work of art. Ten Thousand Li of the Yangzi River exemplifies a type of fifteenth-century painting in which earlier styles—especially those of the Southern Song—were intensified to cater to the aesthetic of court and urban patrons."
Saucer_with_two_chi_dragons,"This elegant saucer features an unusual design—two sinuous dragons covered with hair rather than scales. Their complex layout amid floral scrolls matches compositions often seen on works from the early Ming period. The saucer also has carving that is distinctively sharp and deep with less polished corners. These elements suggest that the piece is an early example of Yunnan carving, a lacquer school attributed to the Yunnan region of southwest China that developed from the fourteenth to sixteenth century."
Pair_of_Finials_in_the_Shape_of_Mythical_Beasts,"From the fifth to the third century B.C., images of mythical animals began to appear in China that hinted at contact with nomadic peoples from the north and west. These two finials have beaks, wings, and powerful legs: a bird-quadruped hybrid likely connected to the Western griffin. They are inlaid with glass “compound-eye” or “dragonfly-eye” beads, an invention of the Warring States period (475–221 B.C.). Their hollow sockets imply use as ornaments on ceremonial weapons or staffs."
Female_Musician_Playing_a_Zither,"This kneeling musician, together with the two other musicians and two dancers in this gallery, once formed part of a troupe of performers interred with a deceased prince to entertain him in the afterlife. She was excavated together with her instrument, the realistic depiction of which allows for its identification as a se, a type of zither. Music and dance played a crucial part in court rituals, and the number of dancers and musicians made available to nobles was a prerogative based on rank. Therefore, these earthenware performers may reflect the permitted scope of such fanfare for this prince."
Sutra_container_with_Daoist_pantheon,"This container held a Daoist scripture, or sutra, on an imperial altar and exemplifies the finest carved lacquerware from the imperial Qing workshop. On its meticulously carved sliding cover is a celestial audience of more than 150 deities convened by the Great Jade Emperor (Yuhuang Dadi). Imperial archives reveal that the Qianlong Emperor was directly involved in the design process and made several adjustments to satisfy his personal taste. After it was approved by him in early 1744, the design was sent to the imperial workshop in Suzhou to be produced."
Spearhead,"The spear (mao) was the primary hand weapon for jabbing in ancient China. Its use continued into the Qin era, which also witnessed the emergence of the pi, a broad-bodied spear with flat edges. The Qin army was equipped with both types of spear, though use of the pi was more widespread. Pit no. 1 of the First Emperor’s mausoleum yielded five mao versus sixteen pi, a ratio of one to three, indicating that the pi had relegated the mao to a secondary position on the battlefield."
Standing_Archer,"Gazing straight ahead, the archer positions his hands as though holding a loaded crossbow, ready to shoot. In the burial pit, standing archers were often placed around their kneeling counterparts, suggesting that they would shoot in turn. All the terracotta warriors were once equipped with real bronze weapons, some of which may have been used in battle by living soldiers. About 40,000 bronze weapons and arrowheads were unearthed from the pit where this soldier was found."
Four_chariot_warriors,"These twelve figures were among the roughly 2,400 terracotta warriors excavated from the tomb of Liu Yue, prince of a Han fief state. Made of fine clay, the figures were originally brightly painted, as indicated by surviving traces of pigment. The charioteers assume seated postures, as they would on their vehicles, while the foot soldiers, arms extended, probably once held long-handled dagger-axes or spears. They represent the two major components of the Han army during the early years of the dynasty: the chariot division and the infantry."
Pair_of_Crossbow_Holders_(Cheng_nu_qi_)_with_Crossbow_Ornament,"Cheng nu qi were used to secure crossbows to chariots, ensuring their ready access by soldiers. They were usually made of bronze and occurred in pairs. The body of the holder assumed a flattened cylindrical shape. The front end extended upward into a hook, while the back end opened into a socket that attached to the front of the chariot car. (Revisit the chariot model in the first gallery to envision a mounted crossbow in use.) The present example is one of six pairs of crossbow holders excavated from the tomb of Prince Liu Sheng of Zhongshan. Its impeccable manufacture reveals the lavish tastes of Han nobles."
Civil_Official,"This civil official or scribe was one of twelve figures found in a pit southwest of the First Emperor’s tomb. The pit and its contents may have represented the office of the Commandant of the Court, the highest legal bureau in the empire. The figure’s peaked cap probably represents the type worn by officials of his merit rank. His long robe is belted; many such figures wear a knife and a bag suspended from their belt, the bag presumably containing a sharpening stone. The knife was used to excise errors written on bamboo or wood documents."
Four_horses,"Each of these horses is carved from a single piece of wood. They are lacquered in black with highlights in bright red. The riders, each one also carved from a single woodblock, are not lacquered but painted, with pigment over white slip, now mostly lost after millennia of burial. They probably functioned as honor guards in a ceremonial procession, a typical element of Han tomb furnishings. It is notable that they were found at Mianyang, Sichuan Province, where the lacquer industry flourished during the Han dynasty."
Head_of_Warrior,"This detailed visage of a young warrior is among the most striking to be recovered from the tomb of Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 B.C.). His well-modeled physical features perpetuate the “realism” of Qin sculpture—represented most notably by the terracotta warriors of the First Emperor of Qin. Although this tendency toward naturalism survived into the early phases of Han figural art, it was only a brief episode, soon to be replaced by a highly stylized portrayal of the human form."
Ornamental_Plaque,"Depicted here is a lively scene of riders and various animals, including a dragon. It bears an astonishing affinity to ornaments found at Tillya Tepe, in northern Afghanistan, attesting to China’s overland trade with distant lands."
Tripod_Food_Container_(Ding)_with_Cloud_Pattern,"Used as a ritual container for food, the ding tripod was one of the most important status symbols in ancient China. The present example reflects the Han trend of using lacquer instead of bronze for making such vessels. It further exemplifies the high-quality lacquerware produced in official workshops in Sichuan during the early Western Han. It bears a mark reading “made in the city of Chengdu,” the capital of Sichuan."
Kneeling_Archer,"Excavations of the mausoleum of the First Emperor of Qin revealed terracotta models of 108 cavalry, 332 archers and infantry, and a combined unit of more than 300 charioteers, cavalry, and infantry, all fully armored. Based on this figure’s gestures, we can assume that he was an archer, whose original weapon—a crossbow— is now lost. He is the only figure on view here that still bears traces of color, indicating that he was once vividly painted (see the red of his armor laces and the black of his collar). Chemical analysis suggests the use of mineral pigments such as cinnabar, azurite, malachite, bone or lead white, and an artificially produced mineral pigment commonly known as “Han purple.”"
Four_Infantrymen,"These twelve figures were among the roughly 2,400 terracotta warriors excavated from the tomb of Liu Yue, prince of a Han fief state. Made of fine clay, the figures were originally brightly painted, as indicated by surviving traces of pigment. The charioteers assume seated postures, as they would on their vehicles, while the foot soldiers, arms extended, probably once held long-handled dagger-axes or spears. They represent the two major components of the Han army during the early years of the dynasty: the chariot division and the infantry."
Armored_Infantryman,"The main battalion of the First Emperor’s terracotta army comprised infantrymen like this one, aligned in rows of four. He wears body and shoulder armor over a long tunic. Judging from his gesture, he once held a weapon, possibly a halberd or spear.The terracotta warriors were all products of mass production. Parts such as the head, arms, and torso were molded separately as modules and then assembled. Before firing, however, clay was applied to their surfaces to allow for individualization and refinement. Most figures were fired as a single piece, suggesting the use of large-chambered kilns."
Chariot_Model_(Modern_Replica),"The chariots on which these two half-life-size models are based were excavated in 1980 from the mausoleum complex of the First Emperor of Qin. Both models bear details faithful to full-size examples. Model no. 1, shielded by an umbrella-like canopy, is a light chariot, used in battle or for inspection tours. Model no. 2 has a heavier carriage, and its box, enclosed under an oval-shaped canopy, is large enough for passengers to sit or sleep.After his conquest was complete, the First Emperor toured the unified country in his chariot—the same vehicle that would later carry his body to Xianyang for burial. These replicas may have been intended to evoke that chariot. As such, they worked in concert with the terracotta warriors, stone armors, bronze weapons, and interred body of the emperor to complete a narrative of eternal power."
Lamp_in_the_Shape_of_a_Deer,"One of a pair, this lamp was excavated from the area of a princely tomb that housed bathroom utensils. Judging by its long neck and mane, this deer probably represents the mi species, or Père David’s deer, which populated northern China in antiquity but has since gone extinct. The tray would have been filled with an animal- or plant-based fuel, and a hemp stem was plugged onto each of the three spikes, to be lit as a wick. Two lumps of beeswax were found together with this lamp, providing evidence of its use as lighting fuel in the Han dynasty."
Serving_tray,"Made from tree sap, lacquer was one of the earliest inventions of East Asia. Its use in southeast China can be traced to the Neolithic period. Although raw lacquer is toxic, it is harmless when dry, and its remarkable resistance to water, acid, and heat makes it ideal for culinary utensils.This group represents a set of tablewares for individual use, reflecting dining etiquette of the Han period. Each person had his or her own low table on which a tray of vessels for food and drink was placed. Guests did not sit around one large table, as they do today."
Head_of_a_Broad_Spear_(Pi),"The spear (mao) was the primary hand weapon for jabbing in ancient China. Its use continued into the Qin era, which also witnessed the emergence of the pi, a broad-bodied spear with flat edges. The Qin army was equipped with both types of spear, though use of the pi was more widespread. Pit no. 1 of the First Emperor’s mausoleum yielded five mao versus sixteen pi, a ratio of one to three, indicating that the pi had relegated the mao to a secondary position on the battlefield."
Four_chariot_drivers,"These twelve figures were among the roughly 2,400 terracotta warriors excavated from the tomb of Liu Yue, prince of a Han fief state. Made of fine clay, the figures were originally brightly painted, as indicated by surviving traces of pigment. The charioteers assume seated postures, as they would on their vehicles, while the foot soldiers, arms extended, probably once held long-handled dagger-axes or spears. They represent the two major components of the Han army during the early years of the dynasty: the chariot division and the infantry."
Horse,"The Qin were known for their expertise in raising horses, a knowledge likely gleaned from their nomadic neighbors. By the late Eastern Zhou period (771–256 B.C.), they employed large numbers of horses to pull chariots, creating a formidable force on the battlefield.The present example was one of thirty-two horses found in a single pit. They were accompanied by eight chariots and twenty-four charioteers, meaning that there were four horses and three soldiers for each chariot. This horse is heftily built with alert eyes, pointed ears, a well-trimmed mane, and a knotted tail—all characteristics of Qin war horses."
Female_Musician_Playing_a_Flute_or_Panpipe_(Sheng?),"This kneeling musician, together with the two other musicians and two dancers in this gallery, once formed part of a troupe of performers interred with a deceased prince to entertain him in the afterlife. That she raises both arms to her mouth suggests that she may have played a wind instrument. Her hands were missing at the time of excavation, but a panpipe and a type of reedpipe identified as a sheng were discovered alongside her, suggesting her role."
Wine_Container_(Zhong)_with_Interlacing_Dragons,"This extraordinary vessel was unearthed from the tomb of Prince Liu Sheng. One of the most important archaeological discoveries of the Han period, the tomb yielded numerous luxury objects that illuminate the magnificence of Han craftsmanship. The pattern of stylized dragons and phoenixes shares similarities with earlier Qin motifs. An inscription on its underside indicates that it was used at the kitchen of the Prince of Chu, who attended the Rebellion of the Seven States in 154 B.C. It was probably a trophy presented to Liu Sheng after his father, the Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 B.C.), quashed the rebellion."
Chariot_Model_(Modern_Replica),"The chariots on which these two half-life-size models are based were excavated in 1980 from the mausoleum complex of the First Emperor of Qin. Both models bear details faithful to full-size examples. Model no. 1, shielded by an umbrella-like canopy, is a light chariot, used in battle or for inspection tours. Model no. 2 has a heavier carriage, and its box, enclosed under an oval-shaped canopy, is large enough for passengers to sit or sleep.After his conquest was complete, the First Emperor toured the unified country in his chariot—the same vehicle that would later carry his body to Xianyang for burial. These replicas may have been intended to evoke that chariot. As such, they worked in concert with the terracotta warriors, stone armors, bronze weapons, and interred body of the emperor to complete a narrative of eternal power."
Mold_for_“Half-Ounce”_Coins_(Banliang),"The Qin economy was monetarized in the mid-fourth century, and over time many different types of bronze coin were in circulation. This mold may date from 210 B.C., when the First Emperor ordered the issue of greater numbers of “half-ounce” coins. The Qin also used standard-sized bolts of cloth as a medium of exchange, with one length of cloth equaling eleven coins. The Han generally followed Qin monetary policy and, under Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 B.C.), issued a new type of bronze coin, the wuzhu, consolidating production in 114 B.C."
Model_Armor,"Excavations of the First Emperor’s tomb yielded numerous stone models of armors and helmets, all of which appear to be copies of actual metal armors, and presumably the more advanced, iron gear of the Qin era. The present example is structurally complete, with body armor, shoulder plates, and a fringe at the waist and hips. The rows of scales comprising the body armor are fixed, while those of the shoulder plates and fringe allow for movement."
Female_Musician_Playing_Chimes,"Music and dance played a crucial part in court rituals, facilitating harmony between the cosmos and humankind. This kneeling musician, together with the two other musicians and two dancers in this gallery, once formed part of a troupe of performers interred with a deceased prince to entertain him in the afterlife. She can be identified as a chime player by her posture. Her half-closed hands might have held a pair of wood hammers, with which to strike the chimes."
Female_Dancer,"To transport worldly pleasures and activities into the afterlife, ceramic models of objects from everyday life were often interred in tombs together with the deceased. This earthenware model of a dancer, one of a performing group whose companions also appear in this gallery, was made to entertain the tomb occupants into eternity. Captured mid-movement, the woman appears to be performing a slow, elegant dance that highlights her long sleeves. Bending to the left so that her body forms an S shape, she raises both arms into smooth curves to either side."
Model_Helmet,"This model helmet replicates the iron headgear that began to supplant bronze examples in the late Warring States period (475–221 B.C.). All of the First Emperor’s terracotta warriors wear suits of armor, but none wears a helmet. The reason for this may be the nature of the terracotta army’s function: to simulate a funerary procession for their ruler. According to protocol, subordinates had to remove their helmets when appearing before the emperor."
Rhinoceros_and_Groom,"Excessive hunting led to the near extinction of the rhinoceros in Han-dynasty China, occasioning their importation from southeast Asia. The anatomical accuracy of the present example indicates that the artist must have modeled his work after a living animal. This rhinoceros, accompanied by a stout, broad-faced groom, formed part of a sculpted menagerie of rare and exotic animals excavated from the tomb of Prince Liu Fei, reflecting not only the prince’s luxurious lifestyle but also the reach of the empire’s influence far beyond its borders."
Jar_with_Two_Handles,"Two-handled jars are known from western Sichuan to the far southern province of Yunnan, excavated primarily from slate tombs located along rivers. They are believed to have been made by the Qiang, a tribal people likely from the northern steppes who traveled south to the Dian region, in present-day Yunnan Province. The present example is inlaid with bronze on its upper body and handles, indicating its exceptional status (plain examples are far more common). The twin handles reflect nomadic forms, while the metal inlays indicate the influence of sedentary agricultural societies to the southwest."
Wine_Container_(Fang)_with_Geometric_Patterns,"This magnificent vessel, meticulously inlayed with stylized clouds and geometric patterns, boasts a robust form and two animal-mask ring handles. It functioned as a wine container. Both historical texts and inscriptions on bronzes indicate that a vessel in this form was called fang, meaning “square-shaped vessel.” Inherited from the Warring States period (475–221 B.C.), the fang gained popularity during the Western Han but disappeared in the Eastern Han."
Two_Mat_Weights_in_the_Shape_of_Paiyou_Performers,"The exaggerated expressions and distorted proportions of these two figures suggest that they were paiyou performers, or comedians, at the Han court."
Female_Dancer,"To transport worldly pleasures and activities into the afterlife, ceramic models of objects from everyday life were often interred in tombs together with the deceased. This earthenware model of a dancer, one of a performing group whose companions also appear in this gallery, was made to entertain the tomb occupants into eternity. Captured mid-movement, the woman appears to be performing a gentle, elegant dance that highlights her long sleeves. She bends slightly forward, raising her right arm. Her dangling sleeve, though motionless in the moment, seems to suggest the beginning of the next move."
Sword_with_Ornamental_Fittings,"Iron swords with jade fittings were prevalent during the Western Han dynasty. The use of jade fittings began in the Eastern Zhou (771–256 B.C.), when they appeared on the pommel and guard of bronze swords. By the Western Han, iron had replaced bronze, and jade adorned not only the pommel and guard but also the tip and slide of the scabbard. These four fittings formed a standard combination, and a sword adorned with the full set became known as a yuju jian, or “jade-fitted sword.” They were not intended for battle but, rather, to be worn by royals and elites."
Elephant_and_Groom,"Discovered in a princely tomb together with the rhinoceros figure displayed nearby, this elephant attests to the deceased’s fascination with rare animals. Elephants were once native to central China, but by the time of the Han, climate change and excessive hunting had led to their retreat to the far south and southwest of the empire. The present example is a highly realistic representation, not least in its heavily folded hide. The role of the accompanying figure is unclear, but the awkward proportions of his head and torso suggest that he was probably an animal trainer or a dwarf actor."
Two_Pigs,"Known as “hand warmers,” hardstone pigs were common Han tomb furnishings, placed in the hands of the deceased. Pigs are a symbol of wealth in China, so they were likely meant to provide for the deceased in the afterlife. These examples are realistic in form; over time, such pigs became more stylized, their carving reduced to a few sharp cuts."
Assembly_of_Ornaments,"The set of jade ornaments was likewise discovered in a royal tomb, in this instance, a member of the Dou family. The curving pendant with dragon’s heads reflects a design from earlier traditions, whereas the monkey and bear are novel motifs."
Bear,"Bears are native to China, their presence there known since antiquity. They were kept in Han imperial zoos and parks, where the emperor and his entourage enjoyed watching them in performance or in combat with other animals. Bears appear in Han art in media ranging from metalwork and lacquer to pottery and, as here, jade. Among the earliest examples, dating from the early Western Han, is a hollow brick excavated from the palace of the king of Nanyue. It resembles images of bears on horse ornaments of the nomads, suggesting a possible influence from the Eurasian steppes."
Ornament_with_Two_Dancers,"This ornament depicts two figures dancing atop a sinuous snake. Often interpreted as a sacred animal in the Dian culture, the snake is a common motif in the arts of the Yunnan region, where this object was discovered. The snake also functions as a design device to organically connect the figures and stabilize the composition."
Rooster,"These chickens, together with the pairs of dogs and pigs on this table, and the horses, bovines, and goats on the next table, represent the six most common domesticated animals in ancient China. They were discovered at Yangling, the mausoleum complex of Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 B.C.). Historical texts indicate that tombs were meant to contain a generous supply of the same goods and utensils that served a living person, and this group of earthenware animals may have served as part of the food supply sustaining the emperor in his afterlife."
Ten_Disk-Shaped_Ingots,"The use of gold as money in China can be traced back to the Warring States period (475–221 B.C.). Following the standardization of coinage after the Qin unification, round bronze coins entered regular circulation, and gold became an upscale currency. One of its major uses was as annual tribute from princes and marquises to the central government. These ten gold ingots were among 219 pieces discovered about 4 kilometers east of the site of the Han capital, Chang’an. Each weighs roughly 250 grams, equal to one jin in the Han system."
Pendant,"The peculiar shape of this ornament has led some to associate it with a turtle. Earrings with similar projections, and whose dates concur in part with the Han, have been found at sites in Taiwan, North Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines, pointing to a vigorous maritime trade among early cultures along the South China"
Water_Clock,"This water clock originally had a gauge incised with lines marking divisions of time. Probably made of wood or bamboo, the gauge was inserted into the hole in the cover and floated on the water. As the water drained at a constant rate through the tube at the bottom, the gauge sank steadily, allowing the time to be read at each mark. Water clocks were kept in every office throughout the empire. Beginning in Qin times, officials were required to note the date and time of all incoming and outgoing correspondence and to record this information on the documents themselves."
Standard_Measure_(Dou),"Wang Mang (ca. 45 B.C.– A.D. 23), a usurper of the Han throne, established the short-lived Xin dynasty in A.D. 9. The present vessel is one of the few surviving examples illustrating his standardization of measurements. Most striking are the reliefs of five auspicious crops on its sides, identified by inscriptions. The patterns are too fine to have been cast or engraved and are thought to have been painted with lacquer or made by way of chemical treatment. These sacred omens were widely used in Han visual art and reflect the ideology of the period."
Pair_of_Bovines,"This pair of bovines, together with the goats and horses on this table, and the chickens, dogs, and pigs on the next table, represent the six most common domesticated animals in ancient China. They were discovered at Yangling, the mausoleum complex of Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 B.C.). Historical texts indicate that tombs were meant to contain a generous supply of the same goods and utensils that served a living person, and this group of earthenware animals may have served as part of the food supply sustaining the emperor in his afterlife."
Burial_Ensemble_of_Dou_Wan,"This burial ensemble was excavated from the tomb of Dou Wan, wife of Prince Liu Sheng of Zhongshan. The suit consists of small jade plaques, each meticulously shaped and fitted together with gold wire to delineate the curves of the body. It represents the completion of a magical transformation of a deceased individual’s body, accomplished through a layering of jades. The first layer would have been the set of jade plugs seen here, which were inserted into the nine bodily orifices to seal the corpse. Next came a layer of small and large bi disks. The corpse was then encased in this suit, its head resting on the accompanying pillow. The ensemble of jades protected the body and the soul in their entirety, enabling the deceased to attain immortality."
Pair_of_Standing_Bovines,"Slightly taller than the cow, the bull stands out for its muscled shoulders and sturdier, more compact body. Both are realistic in depiction, with such naturalistic features as bulging eyes and wrinkled noses. Their horns are exaggerated crescents, and tiny triangular incisions across the surface of their bodies evoke the texture of cowhide. Their ears may have been cast separately and later joined to the bodies."
Bowl,"Previously thought to be a Roman import, this bowl’s origins have now been definitively traced to southern China. Hepu, a busy southern seaport and the easternmost end of China’s maritime trade route with India and the Mediterranean, was known to have a thriving glass industry."
Die_for_a_Wine_Game,"This jewel-like die has eighteen faces, two of which are inlaid in silver on gold with the characters jiao (“good go”) and jiulai (“drink wine”). The other sixteen faces are inlaid with the numbers one to sixteen. The die was thrown to decide how many cups of wine a player should drink—quite similar, in fact, to a modern drinking game."
Head_Ornament,"This ornament, found around the head of the deceased, comprises hundreds of turquoise, carnelian, and gold beads. Their shapes vary, from flat to faceted to cylindrical. The ornament was found in Zhangjiachuan, where nomadic tribes from the steppes coexisted alongside the Qin. In shape and technique, these beads reveal the influence of the Qin’s nomadic neighbors."
Cowry_Container_with_Bull_and_Rider,"This object was found at Shizhaishan, an ancient site associated with the Dian people, who are cited in the chapter on “southwestern barbarians” in the ancient Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian). Cowry containers may have been converted from bronze drums; the addition of sculpted figures transformed their top surfaces into decorative covers. They began to appear at the peak of the Bronze Age, when cowry shells entered circulation as currency. But as contact increased between the Dian and the Western Han, bronze coins supplanted cowry shells, and containers such as this one may have fallen out of use."
Harness_Ornament,"This exquisite harness ornament portrays a prancing horse whose hindquarters are rotated 180 degrees, a motif that Eurasian nomads transmitted from the shores of the Black Sea to the north and northwest borders of China."
Wine_Retriever,"This extraordinary vessel was unearthed from the kitchen quarter of a princely tomb. It is the most lavishly decorated example of its kind ever discovered. A bird, which has a hole in its back, sits on a tube connected to a hollow container, which has a hole in its bottom, implying that this object functioned as a siphon. Experiments reveal that liquid (wine) could be drawn upward from the container and would not drain away if the hole on the bird’s back was covered with a thumb. Thus, the retriever worked more efficiently than a scooper or a ladle to convey wine into a cup."
Bell_with_Design_of_a_Human_Face,"Commonly known as “bell with goat horns,” bronze bells of this type have been found in southern and southwestern China and also in northern Vietnam. They are believed to be associated with an ethnic group, referred to in historical sources as the Yue, who were active in the region during the Han era. The bells were found together with bronze drums, another instrument closely associated with the Yue, and at times with long-handled bells, flutes, and even a gong, suggesting that they were played as an ensemble. For unknown reasons, these bells disappeared by the end of the Western Han."
Pair_of_Mittens,"This pair of mittens was one of numerous luxury items found in the compartment of Lady Dai’s coffin that symbolized her living space. Each mitten comprises three types of fabric: plain tabby for the main body, lozenge-patterned gauze as the central ornament, and hand-braided ribbon as the border decoration. Braided into the ribbon at equal intervals are two characters in seal script—qian jin (literally, “thousand gold”), an expression of wealth. An extremely labor-intensive product, this type of refined braidwork was seldom seen after the Han dynasty."
Casting_Model,"Casting models such as these two were used to make ornamental plaques, probably for use on a belt. Their designs are typical of nomadic themes, demonstrating the interchange between the Qin and neighboring ethnic groups."
Model_of_a_Two-Story_House,"This model of a stilt house comprises an L-shaped main building, which may have been the residential space, and a rectangular courtyard for keeping livestock (five pottery swine populate the present example). Illustrating many characteristics of the present-day architecture and way of life in southern China, this type of elevated house may have emerged in response to the hot, humid climate of the south. While the practical two-story stilt-style house is local to the region, the courtyard layout may have been adopted from the China Central Plain."
Short_Sword,"Short swords were used in hand-to-hand combat. As the present example attests, the workmanship of these weapons during the Western Han dynasty was impeccable. Both sides of the blade are inlaid with gold, with one side depicting flames and the other, clouds. Its exquisite decoration designates it as a luxury item for nobles."
Coffin_Handle,"This ornamental coffin handle was one of a pair found close to Prince Liu Sheng’s corpse. Its decoration is exceptional. The mythical figure above the handle has not been precisely identified, but its fearsome aspect likely warded off any evils that might threaten the prince in his afterlife."
Textile_Fragment_with_Floral_Pattern,"This colorful fragment demonstrates a patterning method particular to Western Han textiles. The meandering designs were achieved in two steps: scrolls were first printed in black (likely using a stencil), and then flowers, buds, leaves, and dots were hand-colored in red, gray, and white. Judging from the size of the pattern unit, each complete fabric required thousands of impressions, and all this before the secondary application of color by hand. The intensity of labor and sophistication of design indicate that these textiles, like all the masterworks of embroidery from this tomb, were produced by official workshops."
Tripod_Wine_Container_(Zun),"This elegant tripod wine vessel features fluidly engraved clouds and mythical animals arranged in two registers around the body. The gilded and silvered patterns create a gleaming surface. A vessel of this form was called zun or, more specifically, wenjiuzun, a term that indicates its use to store a clear liquor that could be repeatedly heated. Zun tripods were a popular style of wine container in the Han period, and contemporary visual materials such as the pictorial brick on display nearby demonstrate that they were used in concert with a ladle."
Female_Courtier,"This is one of three figures—a male warrior, a eunuch, and a female courtier—which were recovered at the tomb of Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 B.C.). They were meant to provide for the emperor in his afterlife, the warrior offering protection, the eunuch and the courtier attending to his needs. The figures were mass produced, with their heads, torsos, and legs molded separately as pieces and then joined with clay before firing. They originally were painted, a light reddish brown on their faces and body and black on their hair and eyebrows. Remnants of fabric at the point of excavation suggest that they once wore cloth garments."
Textile_Fragment_with_Floral_Pattern,"Compared with the large-cloud pattern of the “longevity embroidery” on view nearby, each design unit of this delicate work of embroidery is smaller, and the spaces between stitches is finer. The red buds and curling scrolls relate this pattern to cornelian cherry (zhuyu), a red-fruiting plant used widely in ancient China for medicinal and ceremonial purposes. A fruit-laden branch of the zhuyu worn in the hair on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month (chongyang festival) was believed to ward off evil."
Hollow_Brick_with_Dragon,"Excavations at Xianyang, the Qin capital, have revealed an architectural complex made up of several royal palaces. They were built on raised platforms and connected by corridors. Their floors were paved with solid tiles decorated with molded patterns, including this one with lozenge- and S-shaped ornaments.The two large hollow bricks at the center of the gallery were used as steps into the palace hall. They bear lively patterns of mythical animals. The dragon probably symbolizes the east, and the tortoise entwined with a snake, known as Xuanwu, the north. Along with the White Tiger (symbol of the west) and Red Bird (symbol of the south), these beasts constituted the cosmological icons of the four cardinal directions."
Warrior,"This is one of three figures—a male warrior, a eunuch, and a female courtier—which were recovered at the tomb of Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 B.C.). They were meant to provide for the emperor in his afterlife, the warrior offering protection, the eunuch and the courtier attending to his needs. The figures were mass produced, with their heads, torsos, and legs molded separately as pieces and then joined with clay before firing. They originally were painted, a light reddish brown on their faces and body and black on their hair and eyebrows.Remnants of fabric at the point of excavation suggest that they once wore cloth garments."
Pouch,"Excavated from a woman’s tomb at Niya, this pouch, sewn from two pieces of wool tapestry, illustrates third-century cosmetic practices along the Silk Road. Woven onto the gold face of the pouch is a colorful, floral-patterned belt on a dark blue background. Inside, the pouch is lined with wool felt, and colorful pieces of plain silk decorate its edges. It was found containing a bronze mirror—akin to a contemporary travel compact."
Double-Layered_Box,"This luxurious box formed part of the deceased’s personal effects, unearthed together with a large group of musical instruments and wood figurines of performers and waiters. A bronze mirror found in its lower layer indicates that it was a cosmetics box. The red and green clouds painted on its black-lacquered surface are outlined meticulously in white. Exceptionally, these patterns were applied using mineral pigments mixed with oil; among more than five hundred pieces of lacquer excavated at Mawangdui, only a few objects were painted in this way."
Lamp_with_Nine_Branches,"Multibranch lamps were popular in ancient China. The present example has a surmounting oil tray in the shape of a waterbird, possibly a duck. Its nine branches are arranged in three tiers, each carrying a small heart-shaped tray with a spike at the center to hold a wick. The lamp was discovered in a large, lavishly furnished tomb, possibly that of a government official, in the far southwest of the empire. Found together with a complete set of ritual vessels, costumes, and lacquerwares, the lamp demonstrates the reach and influence of the central government."
Court_Attendant:_Eunuch,"This is one of three figures—a male warrior, a eunuch, and a female courtier—which were recovered at the tomb of Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 B.C.). They were meant to provide for the emperor in his afterlife, the warrior offering protection, the eunuch and the courtier attending to his needs. The figures were mass produced, with their heads, torsos, and legs molded separately as pieces and then joined with clay before firing. They originally were painted, a light reddish brown on their faces and body and black on their hair and eyebrows. Remnants of fabric at the point of excavation suggest that they once wore cloth garments."
Drainage_Tube,"Qin–Han cities and palaces had sophisticated drainage systems. Large pottery tubes accommodated the water supply and sewage: cylindrical ones for clean water and pentagonal ones for wastewater. The pentagonal shape lent stability when the tubes were stacked. Drainage tubes of this type have been found at Qin sites including the royal palace in Xianyang and structures within the mausoleum of the First Emperor. They continued to be used during the Han dynasty, as exemplified by the present example, found in the mausoleum of Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 B.C.)."
Four_Mat_Weights_in_the_Shape_of_Fighting_Animals,"Before the chair was introduced to China in the third century A.D., people sat on the floor or on daybeds, over which straw mats were placed for comfort. Weights, usually in sets of four, held down the corners. These examples show a bear and tiger in fierce combat, reflecting both a nomadic influence and the exotic tastes of Han aristocrats."
Five_Disks_with_Greek_Scripts,"Inscribed on these disks is a blundered rendition of a legend found on a Parthian coin, a reflection of the vivid exchange between Han China, the Hellenistic West, and Central Asia via the Silk Road."
Roof-Tile_End,"Tile ends inscribed with characters, in particular auspicious phrases such as chang sheng wu ji, or “long life without end,” became popular during the Han dynasty. Such phrases could occur in combination with the name of the office or palace on which the tiles appeared. Of the present group of five, one bears the words lai gu gong dang, or “tile of the Laigu Palace.” Another, used at Yuyang Palace, reads yu yang qian sui, or “one thousand years of (i.e., long live) the Yuyang [Palace].”"
Goose,"This goose is one of forty-six life-size bronze waterfowl discovered in a single pit at the mausoleum of the First Emperor. The pit also yielded fifteen terracotta figures, likely representing musicians, who together with the birds recreated a scene of leisure and entertainment in the imperial garden. The birds are anatomically accurate and exhibit subtle differences in position, be they at rest, swimming, or eating. Some of the birds still bear traces of original pigments."
Textile_Fragment_with_Geometric_Patterns,"This textile fragment demonstrates a complicated weaving technique known for only a brief period during the Western Han: the tightly arranged geometric patterns have a raised appearance, achieving a velvet-like effect via the use of highly twisted warps. In addition to several pieces from Mawangdui, a few examples of the technique have been discovered from tombs in Mongolia and in northwest Gansu Province. Because it resembles embroidery, this type of fabric is often related to “woven embroidery” (zhijinxiu), a legendary weaving technique that, according to historical texts, had already been lost by A.D. 54."
Ten_“Half-Ounce”_Coins_(Banliang),"The Qin economy was monetarized in the mid-fourth century, and over time many different types of bronze coin were in circulation. This mold may date from 210 B.C., when the First Emperor ordered the issue of greater numbers of “half-ounce” coins. The Qin also used standard-sized bolts of cloth as a medium of exchange, with one length of cloth equaling eleven coins. The Han generally followed Qin monetary policy and, under Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 B.C.), issued a new type of bronze coin, the wuzhu, consolidating production in 114 B.C."
Textile_Fragment_with_Lozenges,"In contrast to the multicolored embroideries found in the same tomb, this light fabric features subtler motifs in a more somber, coffee-colored palette. The motif—a large lozenge with two smaller lozenges on its shorter ends—is thought to be a stylized rendering of an erbei, or winged cup, the most popular shape of drinking cup of the period (see a lacquer example of one such cup in the adjacent gallery). It may correspond to the “cup pattern” (beiwen) mentioned in historical texts."
Incense_Burner_(Boshan_Lu),"This censer is of a type called boshan lu, or those in the shape of the universal mountain. The openwork lid features the cardinal emblems of early Han art: the Blue Dragon in the east, the Red Bird in the south, the White Tiger in the west, and the Dark Warrior in the north, the last of which is generally represented by a turtle entwined with a snake but here is embodied by a camel. The camel reflects Han contact with its nomadic neighbors. Similarly, the scene of animal combat and the man leading a cart on the lid’s upper register recall motifs on plaques excavated in the Ordos region, at the northwestern frontier of the empire."
Brick_with_snake-tortoise_pattern,"Excavations at Xianyang, the Qin capital, have revealed an architectural complex made up of several royal palaces. They were built on raised platforms and connected by corridors. Their floors were paved with solid tiles decorated with molded patterns, including this one with lozenge- and S-shaped ornaments.The two large hollow bricks at the center of the gallery were used as steps into the palace hall. They bear lively patterns of mythical animals. The dragon probably symbolizes the east, and the tortoise entwined with a snake, known as Xuanwu, the north. Along with the White Tiger (symbol of the west) and Red Bird (symbol of the south), these beasts constituted the cosmological icons of the four cardinal directions."
Cowry_Container_with_Scene_of_Sacrifice,"Thirty-five sculpted figures create a dense composition on this container’s cover. Escorted by two mounted horsemen and flanked by servants, a gilded female sits on a palanquin. The gilding may indicate a higher status. One kneeling female, possibly a servant, holds a parasol, while another female and two males wield a shovel and sowing tools; the group may signal an agricultural ritual. The remaining figures, scattered around the rim, comprise what appears to be a market scene. The figures were likely cast separately and then soldered to the cover."
Incense_burner,"The openwork on the vessel’s lid allowed fragrant smoke to waft out when incense was burning inside. Whereas in later dynasties charcoal was used to heat incense wood, the practice of the Han period and earlier was to burn fragrant plants, as discovered through specimens found in archaeological excavations. The elite owners of incense burners such as this one would have demanded elaborate craftsmanship and expensive material to demonstrate their wealth and taste. The brilliant gilded surface and magnificent openwork of entwined dragons perfectly answered the request."
Paving_Tile,"Excavations at Xianyang, the Qin capital, have revealed an architectural complex made up of several royal palaces. They were built on raised platforms and connected by corridors. Their floors were paved with solid tiles decorated with molded patterns, including this one with lozenge- and S-shaped ornaments.The two large hollow bricks at the center of the gallery were used as steps into the palace hall. They bear lively patterns of mythical animals. The dragon probably symbolizes the east, and the tortoise entwined with a snake, known as Xuanwu, the north. Along with the White Tiger (symbol of the west) and Red Bird (symbol of the south), these beasts constituted the cosmological icons of the four cardinal directions."
Seal_of_Office_Responsible_for_Crops,"This seal was found at Niya, in far northwestern China. Now in ruins, Niya was once an oasis in the bleak desert, bustling with merchants’ caravans and diplomatic envoys traveling between China and Central and West Asia. It was likely the place for an outpost of the Han government, as well. Although the exact name of the “office responsible for crops” is not recorded, such an office could have been part of a Han military and farming garrison at Niya. Officers concerned with agricultural affairs are mentioned in several documents of the Han and later periods."
Two_Horses,"These horses, draft animals for a military vehicle, were assembled from modular parts made separately in molds, among them the ears, head and neck, trunk, legs, and tail. A hole at the back of the mouth allowed for the installation of the rein. Faint traces of pigment on the lips, ears, and nostrils suggest that they were once painted. By the mid-second century B.C., when cavalry began to replace chariots on the battlefield, the role of horses in Han warfare grew more prominent. The Han army traveled with thousands of horses on expedition to the Western Regions."
Roof-Tile_End,"Tile ends inscribed with characters, in particular auspicious phrases such as chang sheng wu ji, or “long life without end,” became popular during the Han dynasty. Such phrases could occur in combination with the name of the office or palace on which the tiles appeared. Of the present group of five, one bears the words lai gu gong dang, or “tile of the Laigu Palace.” Another, used at Yuyang Palace, reads yu yang qian sui, or “one thousand years of (i.e., long live) the Yuyang [Palace].”"
Hen,"These chickens, together with the pairs of dogs and pigs on this table, and the horses, bovines, and goats on the next table, represent the six most common domesticated animals in ancient China. They were discovered at Yangling, the mausoleum complex of Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 B.C.). Historical texts indicate that tombs were meant to contain a generous supply of the same goods and utensils that served a living person, and this group of earthenware animals may have served as part of the food supply sustaining the emperor in his afterlife."
Ornamental_Plaque_Showing_a_Bullfight,"This ornamental plaque comprises eleven figures and a bull, illustrating a bullfight preceding a ritual sacrifice. Plaques illustrating bullfights are often identified as one scene in a multipart ritual. Other, related scenes depict bulls running into the fray and being slain after capture. The function of these rectangular ornamental plaques is still under debate. Traces of silk or lacquered leather on some examples suggest that they may have been attached as surface ornaments to an organic material."
Four_riders,"Each of these horses is carved from a single piece of wood. They are lacquered in black with highlights in bright red. The riders, each one also carved from a single woodblock, are not lacquered but painted, with pigment over white slip, now mostly lost after millennia of burial. They probably functioned as honor guards in a ceremonial procession, a typical element of Han tomb furnishings. It is notable that they were found at Mianyang, Sichuan Province, where the lacquer industry flourished during the Han dynasty."
Roof-Tile_End,"Tile ends inscribed with characters, in particular auspicious phrases such as chang sheng wu ji, or “long life without end,” became popular during the Han dynasty. Such phrases could occur in combination with the name of the office or palace on which the tiles appeared. Of the present group of five, one bears the words lai gu gong dang, or “tile of the Laigu Palace.” Another, used at Yuyang Palace, reads yu yang qian sui, or “one thousand years of (i.e., long live) the Yuyang [Palace].”"
Three_Hoof-Shaped_Ingots,"In 2011 local governments intercepted the looting of an ancient tomb west of Nanchang. Excavations revealed that it belonged to Liu He (92–59 B.C.), who in 74 B.C. was enthroned as emperor but was deposed after only twenty-seven days. He became known as the marquis of Haihun. Among the hundreds of gold ingots recovered from his tomb were nearly fifty in the shape of hooves. They are of particular significance, for in 95 B.C. Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 B.C.) ordered that the name of gold coinage be changed to linzhi (qilin-hoof) and mati (horse-hoof) to match auspicious omens he had seen in a vision: a white qilin unicorn and a “heavenly” horse."
Casting_Model,"Casting models such as these two were used to make ornamental plaques, probably for use on a belt. Their designs are typical of nomadic themes, demonstrating the interchange between the Qin and neighboring ethnic groups."
Winged_Cup,"Made from tree sap, lacquer was one of the earliest inventions of East Asia. Its use in southeast China can be traced to the Neolithic period. Although raw lacquer is toxic, it is harmless when dry, and its remarkable resistance to water, acid, and heat makes it ideal for culinary utensils.This group represents a set of tablewares for individual use, reflecting dining etiquette of the Han period. Each person had his or her own low table on which a tray of vessels for food and drink was placed. Guests did not sit around one large table, as they do today."
Roof-Tile_End,"Tile ends inscribed with characters, in particular auspicious phrases such as chang sheng wu ji, or “long life without end,” became popular during the Han dynasty. Such phrases could occur in combination with the name of the office or palace on which the tiles appeared. Of the present group of five, one bears the words lai gu gong dang, or “tile of the Laigu Palace.” Another, used at Yuyang Palace, reads yu yang qian sui, or “one thousand years of (i.e., long live) the Yuyang [Palace].”"
Six_Niuzhong_Bells,"Bronze chime bells played a key role in ritual music from the Zhou (ca. 1046–256 B.C.) to the Han dynasty. Hung on an ornamented stand in graduated order of size, these clapperless bells were sounded with a mallet. The shape of the bells enabled two distinct tones, produced by striking either the center or the sides of the face. Generally, larger bells emitted a sound of higher volume but lower pitch. These six chime bells were excavated only recently from the extravagant tomb of the marquis of Haihun."
Two_Dishes,"Made from tree sap, lacquer was one of the earliest inventions of East Asia. Its use in southeast China can be traced to the Neolithic period. Although raw lacquer is toxic, it is harmless when dry, and its remarkable resistance to water, acid, and heat makes it ideal for culinary utensils.This group represents a set of tablewares for individual use, reflecting dining etiquette of the Han period. Each person had his or her own low table on which a tray of vessels for food and drink was placed. Guests did not sit around one large table, as they do today."
Album_of_the_Note_on_Respect_of_Elders_composed_by_the_Qianlong_Emperor,"In China, jade albums have a long history that can be traced back to the Tang dynasty (618–907). This album presents an innovation on the form dating to the Qianlong period. On each two-page spread, the text on the right is handwritten in gold pigment on a special dark paper, while on the left-hand page the same calligraphy is incised on a jade plaque. The book reflects the meticulous way artists in the eighteenth-century imperial workshop created artwork to meet the emperor’s taste."
Roof-Tile_End,"Tile ends inscribed with characters, in particular auspicious phrases such as chang sheng wu ji, or “long life without end,” became popular during the Han dynasty. Such phrases could occur in combination with the name of the office or palace on which the tiles appeared. Of the present group of five, one bears the words lai gu gong dang, or “tile of the Laigu Palace.” Another, used at Yuyang Palace, reads yu yang qian sui, or “one thousand years of (i.e., long live) the Yuyang [Palace].”"
Rectangular_box_with_double_dragons,Boxes of this type were also produced in porcelain and were principally used to present important documents or gifts. The four claws on the dragons’ feet suggest that this example was made for a member of the nobility; five-clawed dragons symbolized the emperor.
"Model_Calligraphies_from_the_“Hall_of_Three_Rarities”_(Sanxitang)_and_the_""Collected_Treasures_of_the_Stony_Moat”_(Shiqu_Baoji)","The Hall of Three Rarities, an anthology of rubbings, is one of the monuments of cultural patronage sponsored by the Qianlong Emperor. Based on calligraphic masterworks in the imperial collection, this encyclopedic compilation, which establishes a canon of orthodox writing styles in standard, running, and cursive scripts, is a remarkable demonstration of eighteenth-century connoisseurship and craftsmanship.In eighteenth-century China, the best technique for reproducing a work of calligraphy was to painstakingly make an ink rubbing from a stone engraving. After a tracing copy of the original was made, it was transferred onto a finely polished stone. Next, the traced design was engraved into the stone so that the characters were reversed. Paper was then laid over the stone, dampened, and pressed carefully into the engraved lines. Finally, ink was patted over the surface of the paper so that the recessed characters appeared white against a black ground. This anthology is notable for its precise carving style and the glossy black finish of the rubbings. The stones from which these rubbings were made are preserved in a special hall within the former imperial gardens of Beihai Park, Beijing.Shown here is the final calligraphy in the anthology, a transcription of Eulogy for Ni Kuan (active late 2nd century B.C.) by Dong Qichang (1555–1636), a calligrapher greatly admired by the Qianlong Emperor. Dong's postscript to this text, written in large, cursive-script characters, states that his transcription follows an earlier rendering of this text by the Tang-dynasty court calligrapher Chu Suiliang (596–658)."
Portraits_of_members_of_a_family,"Portrait albums are rare, and this one, which seems to depict an entire family, is particularly unusual. Several of the men wear “rank badges”—textile squares or circles indicating their official position within the Qing-dynasty government. In each image, objects of refinement—books, fine furniture, scholar’s rocks—are carefully placed around the sitter to indicate his or her sophistication. This album is a touching document of one family’s attempt to record its ideal self-image."
Marshal_Wang,"Marshal Wang, one of the fierce guardian deities of Daoism, is charged with protecting Daoist temples. Like many popular Daoist deities, Wang was originally a human who was posthumously deified and revered as a god. Here, he rides a flaming wheel, vanquishing the evil serpent spirits in the river below. The gold inscription at upper right indicates that this painting was commissioned by an imperial concubine at the court of the Ming emperor Jiajing, a generous patron of Daoism."
Celebratory_scene,"Dozens of guests and family members converge at a reception hall to pay their respects to an honored couple. Despite the absence of written inscriptions, the imagery of the work identifies the event and its setting: the birthday party of the celebrated Tang-dynasty general Guo Ziyi (697–781) at his residence. According to legend, Guo had many sons and grandsons, all of whom were highly successful in their official careers.By the seventeenth century, Guo’s reception had become a metaphor for auspicious birthday celebrations in general. It was frequently depicted on large works that were given as congratulatory gifts to distinguished individuals."
Flowers_and_Garden_Rock,"This tapestry picture features a contrast between the boldly decorative garden rock, which was woven in gold with black outlines, and the more delicately realized hydrangea and other flowers, woven in various hues of silk that have faded with time. A close look reveals that the leaves are outlined in gold thread."
Toy,"This embroidered toy features a man riding a qilin, a fantastic animal commonly found in the decorative arts of the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing dynasties. Although its appearance can vary, the qilin seen here combines the features of a dragon (head, horns, and scales), a fantastical lion (tail), and a deer (body and hooves). Various auspicious items hang from the qilin, among them (from the left) scrolls, a sycee (silver ingot), books, and a handheld decorative accessory called a ruyi. The detachable rider holds a sheng, a type of mouth organ."
"Woman's_Robe_with_""Longevity""_Medallions","This robe, when worn with a matching dark blue coat (also in the Museum's collection), would have been appropriate formal wear for the wife of a nobleman or official on auspicious occasions such as birthdays. Each of the medallions combines the character for longevity (shou) with a pair of swastikas (wan), denoting ten thousand years."
Square_with_Phoenixes,"A pair of phoenixes appears above waves and a stylized mountain on a yellow background strewn with many blooming flowers, among them a chrysanthemum, lotus, camellia, and morning glory."
Guanyin_the_Bringer_of_Sons,"The most precious treasure in premodern China was a son to carry on the family legacy. Reflecting this fervently held wish, a new form of Guanyin emerged that presented the bodhisattva as a bestower of sons. This intimate sculpture, in which Guanyin cradles the hoped-for baby boy, would have been made for personal veneration by a wealthy devotee who wished to become a mother. Note that the precocious child holds a book—a sign that he will become a great scholar and thereby advance the family’s standing."
Vase_with_scenes_and_poems_from_Farming_and_Weaving,"Rice farming and silk production, both represented here, were cornerstones of agrarian society in premodern China. Woodcuts made after imperial court paintings based on the twelfth-century text Farming and Weaving (Geng Zhi Tu) were widely used as models for artworks in other media, such as this vase. The headings of the texts on the front and back sides of the vase are “flattening rice paddy” (ludu) and “shelving silkworm cocoons” (shangcu)."
Jar_with_immortals,"Daoist immortals—identifiable by their wild hair, unkempt clothing, and feats of magic—cavort in a garden setting. This vibrant type of ceramic decoration, called fahua, entails applying raised lines and dots of slip with a piping bag, as if decorating a cake, in addition to glazes of various colors."
"Mirror_with_Queen_Mother_of_the_West,_Lord_of_the_East,_and_mythical_creatures","The seated figure with two attendants is the Queen Mother of the West, as indicated in the inscription. Seated across from her is her consort, the Lord of the East. According to Han dynasty mythology, they jointly ruled the universe."
Vase_from_a_Set_of_Five-Piece_Altar_Set_(Wugong),"Cloisonné is the technique of creating designs on metal vessels with colored glass paste placed within enclosures made of copper or bronze wires, which have been bent or hammered into the desired patterns. Known as cloisons (French for ""partitions""), the enclosures are generally either glued or soldered onto the metal body. The glass paste, or enamel—which gets its color from metallic oxides—is painted into the contained areas of the design. The vessel is usually fired at a relatively low temperature, about 800 degrees Celsius. Enamels tend to shrink during firing, and the process is repeated several times to fill in the design. Once this process is completed, the surface of the vessel is rubbed until the edges of the cloisons are visible."
Canonization_scroll_of_Li_Zhong,"This painting, an unsigned work of a provincial atelier, is a rare example of popular religious art. Modeled on imperial commendation scrolls, with their ornamental borders of dragons chasing flaming pearls, the scroll illustrates the investiture of a local god into the Daoist pantheon. The first half of the scroll depicts the court of the Jade Emperor, supreme deity of popular Daoism. The enthroned emperor is flanked by four female attendants, four high officials, and two constellations of star deities, as well as guardians of the east and west, who are accompanied by their directional emblems, the dragon and tiger. Approaching this assembly is a file of haloed deities who have entered the sacred precincts through a pair of heavenly gates. The second half of the scroll depicts the entourage of the local god, including standardbearers with emblems of his status, a white charger, a palanquin with eight porters, guardians of the four directions, four attendants carrying incense burners, and figures bearing his sword and seals. This procession ends with a depiction of the local god, shown larger than life to emphasize his importance. In the sky above, a heavenly messenger appears bearing the scroll of the god's investiture.Following the painting is a transcription of the petition made to the Celestial Master of the Orthodox Unity sect, headquartered at Dragon-Tiger Mountain (Longhu shan) in Jiangxi Province, requesting that the local god, Li Zhong, be recognized as a member of the pantheon. The petition is dated A.D. 1157, but both it and the painting are likely to be copies, probably created during the Ming dynasty. The terminus ante quem for the scroll is established by two appended colophons, both dated 1641."
Bodhidharma,"Bodhidharma was the legendary sixth-century Indian patriarch who brought Chan, also known as Zen (after the Japanese transliteration), Buddhism to China. It was said that Bodhidharma magically crossed the great Yangzi River on just a reed. This sculpture successfully catches the confidence and calm of the legendary figure."
Dish_with_chrysanthemum-petal_rim,"The shape of this thin-cored lacquer dish has parallels with ceramics manufactured in northern China during the Song period, such as Ding ware from Hebei. The gilt decoration on its surface adds another level of subtle beauty. Much of the gilt decoration on this dish has worn off with age and use, but a floral spray design and geometric scroll can still be seen in the center and on the rim, respectively."
Table_screen_with_Bodhidharma_crossing_waves_on_a_reed,"During his tour of southern China in 1765, the Qianlong emperor visited Jinshan, a small island in the Yangtze River, where Bodhidharma, the founder of Zen Buddhism, was said to have crossed the river on a single stalk of reed. Inspired by this legend, the emperor composed a poem praising the patriarch and created a painting of the island. Later, he commissioned this jade plaque, which features his poem and an image of Bodhidharma on the front and his painting of the island on the back."
Cabinet_with_figures_in_a_landscape,"This two-door cabinet appears to be two separate boxes held together by gilt-bronze handles but it is actually a single piece. Six side panels represent figures along a riverbank and on a garden terrace with hills receding in the distance. Deer adorn the tops of the two drawers. The sharp, precise carving of the red lacquer is characteristic of Qianlong workshops, as is the deeply carved background of brocade patterns."
Square-form_vase_with_decoration_of_Su_Shi’s_first_and_second_“Rhapsody_on_Red_Cliff”,"This vase records two texts titled “Rhapsody on Red Cliff,” masterpieces composed by the beloved poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) in the autumn and winter of 1082. Its square form elegantly accommodates the two stories in both text and image. When Su visited the site commemorated in his poems, it was already rich with historical significance owing to the Battle of Red Cliff, believed to have been fought there at the end of the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), but it was forever transformed by his famous poems and soon became a popular theme across all media."
Inkstone_and_cover_with_mandarin_ducks_in_a_lotus_pond,"The simple, functional form of this work is typical of Song literati inkstones. Its cover is finely carved with a pair of mandarin ducks swimming in a lotus pond. The low-relief birds and lotus are further animated by lightly engraved ripples and windswept clouds. Similar patterns found on contemporary ceramics as well as on metalwork in gold or silver attest to the extensive exchange of motifs across different media at this time."
Inkstone_with_dragon_and_carp,"This unusual inkstone is carved from a type of stoneware known as chengni, or “filtered clay.” Made from very fine silted clay that has undergone a labor-intensive process of filtering, kneading, molding, firing, and carving, chengni inkstones became popular during the Song dynasty (960–1279). The vigorous carving style of this piece, however, dates it to the fourteenth century. The inkstone’s decoration invokes the myth that a carp, should it succeed in swimming upstream through the Dragon Gate of the Yellow River, will become a dragon. A metaphor for success on the civil service exam, here, the gulf between carp and dragon is defined by the inkstone and inkwell—whose diligent use might well decide the difference between failure and success."
Model_of_a_bell_(Yong_Zhong),"During the Eastern Zhou period, graduated sets of bronze bells became an important adjunct to courtly ceremonies as well as a mark of elite status. This pottery imitation was undoubtedly part of a set intended for burial to provide the tomb occupant with music in the afterlife."
Flying_Celestial_Figure,These winged celestial beings show remarkable connections to the Western classical tradition. From comparable examples we know that these male figures were represented as flying down from the heavens to attend a Buddhist divinity.
Head_of_Buddha,"This unfired head is related to fifth- to seventh-century clay sculpture from Afghanistan, especially in the treatment of the eyebrows and in the hairstyle of three rows of curls. The site of Rawak comprises a cruciform stupa (relic mound) based on architecture established in Afghanistan and Gandhara; the enclosing wall of this sacred precinct was embellished with hundreds of clay Buddhas and bodhisattvas such as this one."
Border_with_Lozenges_set_within_a_Pearl_Rondel,This jeweled border was set above a hamsa molding (see 30.32.8) in a Buddhist temple at the Khotan site of Pialma.
Goose_(Hamsa)_with_Floral_Tail,This panel was the interior base molding of a Buddhist temple. This goose (hamsa) was part of a large group that ran along the base of the wall surmounted by lozenges withpearls (see 30.32.10). The hamsa is associated with the heavens and thus metaphorically located the sacred space of this temple within a celestial realm.
Fragment_of_a_Halo_with_Buddha_Figure,"These fragments are from an elaborate halo that once adorned a larger-than-life-size Buddha or bodhisattva. The larger Buddha fragment holds his right hand in abhaya mudra, a gesture of approachability. The style of the robes attests to an interest in the classical forms of Gandhara."
Fragment_of_a_Halo_with_Buddha_Figure,"These fragments are from an elaborate halo that once adorned a larger-than-life-size Buddha or bodhisattva.

The larger Buddha fragment holds his right hand in abhaya mudra, a gesture of approachability. The style of the robes attests to an interest in the classical forms of Gandhara."
Rondel_with_Seated_Buddha,"These Buddhas with halos and body mandorlas were part of an elaborate halo that embellished a large standing devotional icon. Little remains of the original polychrome, but it is evident that the bodies were painted red and the faces were white."
Dish_with_Lotus_Pond,"The lotuses and water were painted using blue outlines under the glaze and colored enamels over the glaze. This complicated technique, which began in China in the fifteenth century, was refined in the eighteenth and is often known as doucai, or joined colors."
Celestial_Figure_Emerging_from_a_Flower,This female celestial (apsara) from of a complex halo springs from an open lotus and holds a garland of pearls to honor the deity she must have attended.
Vase_with_Phoenix_and_Peonies,The combination of a phoenix and bright red peonies on this vase creates a visual metaphor for prosperity and righteousness.
Lamp,"While lions are not native to China, there is evidence that some specimens had reached China from the West by the Western Han (206 B.C.–A.D. 9) period. With the firm establishment of Buddhism in China in the Six Dynasties (220–589) period, lions-regarded as defenders of the faith and of the Buddhist law-began to be used in a specifically Buddhist context. The two types of relief lotus petals that circle the bowl and the bottom of this footed lamp were also a popular ornamental motif in sixth-century Buddhist art."
Dish_with_a_dragon_amid_clouds,"Images of front-facing dragons first appeared in the mid-sixteenth century. Commonly depicted in the decorative arts of the late Ming period, they are represented on ceremonial garments, porcelain, and carved objects."
Dish_with_character_for_longevity_(shou),"Eight auspicious emblems, including flaming pearls, a pair of horns, and a pair of books, encircle the character for longevity (shou) in the center of this dish; the same designs are found on the exterior. The dragons on the outer edge all lack one claw. Since five-clawed dragons symbolized the emperor, the claws were likely removed to make the dish suitable for presentation to a member of the nobility or a senior court official."
Bowl_with_Geometric_Designs,"Likely used for serving a liquid such as wine or soup, this bowl is painted with dramatic swirling lines interlaced with small curls and other forms. Known as cloud energy, or yunqi, this design, which was pervasive during the Western Han dynasty, is understood to represent a forbidding but numinous realm inhabited by immortals."
Brush_holder_with_the_story_of_Pan_An,"The young women on the balcony of this wonderfully carved brush holder throw fruit to an attractive young man passing beneath them. He is most likely the extraordinarily handsome scholar Pan An (247–300), who often drew such attention. The cart pulled by a white goat, however, refers to another young man, Wei Jie (286–312), who was also known for his good looks but was not associated with fruit. The artist seems to have freely combined the tales of both men into a composite scene. Such images are often found in various decorative arts from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries."
Women_in_a_Palace,"In China, images of a romanticized world, where elegant women spend their time dancing and playing music, often have historical overtones. Many such scenes are thought to allude to the richness of court life during the Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 220), an endless source for the antiquarian interests of the seventeenth century. Some also illustrate the tragic story of the beautiful Wang Zhaojun, who was sent by Emperor Yuan (reigned 75–33 B.C.) to marry a Xiongnu chieftain in an attempt to pacify these powerful barbarians. Although this screen does not show the standard scene of a painter rendering her image, it is interesting to note that a single horse is depicted standing beneath a willow tree in the center. This animal may represent Wang’s imminent departure from her safe, and luxurious, life at the court to the less sheltered world of the grasslands in the distant north."
Dish_with_lobed_rim,"Found in ceramics, metalwork, and lacquer, dishes shaped with overlapping petals first appear in north China about the eleventh century, and the form later becomes a standard motif in the art of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). This dish, which has an inscription on the bottom giving the name of the maker or owner—a common practice during the Southern Song dynasty—was likely intended to represent a six-petal camellia, a flower often associated with joy and protection."
Bird_peddler,"A jaunty bird peddler is surrounded by six young boys who admire their recent acquisitions or greedily eye other temptations. In addition to various species of birds, his portable display also features a rich assortment of intricate cages, gilt perches, ceramic dishes, lacquer jars, and other paraphernalia required to care for the birds, crickets, and two white rabbits offered for sale.The subject of peddlers first became popular during the Southern Song dynasty (1127–79), when paintings typically showed a rustic knickknack merchant offering his wares to a group of country urchins. During the conscious revival of Song academic styles sponsored by the Ming court, this subject was transformed from a genre image of daily life to an elegant fantasy set within the grounds of an aristocratic household. Here, an elegantly dressed servant, acting the role of peddler, offers a specialized selection of expensive wares to the pampered male children of the family. Such idealized images functioned not merely as entertaining decoration but also as auspicious emblems of a well-governed empire enjoying the rewards of peace and prosperity."
Vase_with_King_Wen_Visiting_the_Scholar_Jiang_Taigong,"The narratives painted on the four sides of the vase were most likely based on similar scenes in woodblock illustrations. The solitary angler at the upper left identifies the scene as a historical narrative, set in the twelfth or eleventh century B.C., in which a ruler named Wen seeks the advice of a scholar named Jiang Taigong."
Wall_hanging_with_lotus,"Delicate silk wall hangings were important interior ornaments for upscale houses in traditional China. This brocade panel features a rich array of lotus in subtle colors. Lotus imagery was first introduced into China as a Buddhist symbol of purity. It later became one of the most popular motifs in Chinese art. Here, lotus blossoms and leaves are combined with various auspicious symbols—coins, ingots, scrolls, and rhinoceros horns—to convey wishes for wealth and good fortune."
Conical_bowl_with_flowers_and_birds_(one_from_a_set),"Vessels such as this example were used mainly for upscale drinking parties or special occasions. Precious metal wares, such as gold and silver, often shared a design language with contemporaneous ceramic and lacquer wares."
Lobed_bowl_stand_with_flowers_and_birds_(one_from_a_set),"Vessels such as this example were used mainly for upscale drinking parties or special occasions. Precious metal wares, such as gold and silver, often shared a design language with contemporaneous ceramic and lacquer wares."
Retreats_in_the_Spring_Hills,"Retreats in the Spring Hills is datable stylistically to the early twelfth century, when artists began to experiment with archaic styles, including the ""blue-and-green"" landscape manner first made popular in the seventh century. In the twelfth-century revival, the flat blue-and-green color scheme was used to evoke feelings of an antique Golden Age. Artists adopted this style to create dreamlike visions of idyllic mountain retreats or Daoist paradises, in contrast to the naturalistic, predominantly monochromatic landscape depictions of the tenth and eleventh centuries."
Covered_box_with_lotus-petal_rim,"Lacquer boxes with lobed sides and pewter trim are unique to the Yuan dynasty. Many were fitted with an interior tray that probably held cosmetics, combs, hairpins, and other adornments."
Egrets_in_Water_Reeds,"This painting recalls Ma Hezhi's handscroll Six Odes Starting with ""Wild Geese,"" in which the image of nesting birds symbolizes the reestablishment of peace under the Southern Song. Here, a family of egrets on a marshy bank are joined by three more alighting from the sky. Bamboo and reeds in the foreground, executed in beautifully controlled, round brushwork, bend in the light breeze. The birds and the swaying bamboo define both the finite world within the picture and the vast space beyond."
Base_for_a_Water_Pipe_(huqqa)_with_Floral_Medallions,"The shape and function indicates that this piece was made for export, probably to India. It remains unclear when the huqqa, used for cooling tobacco or some other substance with water prior to smoking, developed, though historical references indicate that it was used in both India and the Middle East by the sixteenth century."
Tea-bowl_stand_with_phoenixes_amid_flowers,"Phoenixes are often associated with imperial women. The sharpness of the outlines and decoration on this tea-bowl stand is typical of works produced at court in the early fifteenth century. Lacquer stands of this type were used to hold ceramic bowls, following the tradition from the Song dynasty (960–1279)."
Lobed_dish_with_flowers_and_birds_(one_from_a_set),Vessels such as these were used mainly for formal entertaining. It was likely to have been made in one of the cities along the lower reaches of the Yangzi River. The vessel has the same shape as contemporaneous works in porcelain and lacquer.

Buddha_with_a_Halo_and_Flaming_Body_Mandorla,"The Buddha sits in meditation, his hands in dhyana mudra. His facial type, with arched brows and light highlights, is linked to the painting style of Kizil. Most Buddhas from Dandan-Uiliq known from painting and sculpture wear red robes. A group of related votive images painted on wood panels was recovered in the Buddhist temples at Dandan-Uiliq."
Mountain-form_brush_rest_with_mythical_beasts,"The brush rest exemplifies the sophisticated craftsmanship and artistic creativity of pewter ware in seventeenth century China. Taking the form of an auspicious five-peak mountain, the brush rest principal faces are ornamented with mythical beasts in garden settings. A chimera (qilin) stands beside an ingot and a flaming pearl while a fantastic lion clutches in its mouth and claws a ribbon that is fastened to a coin. This imaginative design was highlighted with meticulously applied paper-thin sheets of brass within the outlines of the expertly engraved design."
Theatrical_skirt_with_grapevines,"The pattern of this skirt—part of a theatrical ensemble with matching jacket 30.76.24—features an amalgam of grapevines and dragons that twists and curves across the white background. You can see one dragon head on the left of the jacket, and another can be found in the center on the back. The quality of both the materials and the workmanship is very high: note the subtle changes in color of the silk embroidery within the leaves and the use of gold thread to delineate the branches, leaves, and tendrils of the grapevine."
Winter_Flowers,"The nandina, narcissus, rock, and magic fungus on this tapestry serve as homonyms for the phrase “heavenly immortals’ greeting of longevity” (tian xian zhi shou). At the lower right corner, there is a woven signature of Cui Ba, a painter who was active in the eleventh century and famous for his elegant renderings of flowers and birds. During the second half of the Ming dynasty, Cui’s paintings often served as subjects for tapestries, as can be seen in the emulation of brushstrokes on this extraordinary piece."
Theatrical_jacket_with_grapevines,"The pattern on this jacket—part of a theatrical costume with skirt 30.76.23— features an amalgam of grapevines and dragons that twists and curves across the white background. You can see one dragon head on the left of the jacket, and another can be found in the center on the back. The quality of both the materials and the workmanship is very high: note the subtle changes in color of the silk embroidery within the leaves and the use of gold thread to delineate the branches, leaves, and tendrils of the grapevine."
Vase_with_Buddhist_figures,"By the seventeenth century, traditional Buddhist themes were common both in literati paintings and in the decorative arts. The holy men depicted here are arhats (luohans), Buddha’s disciples. One tussles with a snarling tiger, another calls a roaring dragon, and the third has a cane and a straw hat. Probably copied from a woodblock print, these figures represent stock figures rather than specific individuals."
Panel_with_five_phoenixes_in_a_garden,"Large pictorial silk tapestries such as these were woven mostly in the imperial workshops in Suzhou, a textile center in southeast China. The background of bright yellow, a color exclusive to the emperor, further confirms the imperial origins. Though usually translated as “phoenix” in English, the fenghuang bird is a distinct mythical species with a different set of associations. The fenghuang, most noble of all feathered species, is said to appear only in times of peace and prosperity, so the creature is depicted frequently in works commissioned by imperial courts."
Lobed_dish_with_flowers_and_birds_(one_from_a_set,Vessels such as these were used mainly for formal entertaining. It was likely to have been made in one of the cities along the lower reaches of the Yangzi River. The vessel has the same shape as contemporaneous works in porcelain and lacquer.
Panel_with_Phoenixes_and_Flowers,"A marvelous embroidery work, this canopy represents two powerful phoenixes that strongly resemble a fourteenth-century stone relief panel unearthed in Dadu, the capital city of the Yuan dynasty (now Beijing). Although the precise function is unclear, it may have been designed as canopy for use in a tent by a member of the ruling Mongol family."
Shakyamuni_coming_down_from_the_mountains,"This painting stands midway between the hieratic icons employed in formal temple ceremonies and the informal images that served Chan (or Zen) monks as personal devotional images for use in meditation. The intimate scale, informality of the figures' poses, and landscape setting link the painting to Chan-style depictions of Shakyamuni—the human origin of the Buddha—as an ascetic descending from the mountains just prior to achieving Buddhahood. In this scene, the Buddhist equivalent of Christ's Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, Shakyamuni offers a parallel to the Chan practitioner's search for individual enlightenment.Landscape elements in the painting follow the meticulously descriptive style of the Southern Song Painting Academy. The angular contours of the figures' fluttering drapery lines are flat and conventionalized, however, and suggest an early fourteenth-century date for the piece."
Box_with_Geometric_Designs,"The five distinct geometric patterns on this box are composed of extraordinarily small, thin fragments of pearl shell. This is a refined version of the technique of inlaying mother-of-pearl into a black lacquer surface that was developed in the twelfth century. Fragments of pearl shell were sometimes tinted or painted on the back to enhance their natural colors, such as pink and green."
The_Palace_of_Nine_Perfections,"Yuan Jiang thrived in the commercial world of his native Yangzhou. Catering to the vogue for large-scale hanging scrolls and multipaneled screen paintings as decoration in the ostentatious mansions of the city’s mercantile elite, Yuan specialized in intricate visions of palatial complexes set within sumptuous blue-and-green landscapes intended to evoke Tang and Song prototypes.This screenlike set of scrolls depicts an eighth-century imperial retreat in the hills north of the Tang capital, Chang’an (present-day Xi’an). Destroyed by the end of the Tang dynasty (618–907), the Palace of Nine Perfections is remembered as one of the most splendid residences ever built, with grounds so vast that it was necessary to travel between halls by horseback.Royal palaces have always been likened to Daoist paradises, and Yuan’s vision plays on this theme, with Qing-style palatial buildings set in a fantastic landscape that suggests the enchanted realm of the immortals. But Yuan may have had another model in mind. Executed just two years after the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662–1722) visited Yangzhou on his second southern inspection tour, the painting, which includes a regal entourage—with the emperor and his parasol-bearer prominently featured in the foreground—was undoubtedly also inspired by the ceremonial processions and lavish gardens created to celebrate the imperial visit. Combining legend and architectural fantasy with thinly veiled references to contemporary events, Yuan’s painting is a celebration of the grandiose materialistic lifestyle to which the high society of Yangzhou aspired."
Unfolding_Landscape,"Zheng Chongbin first trained as a figure painter, learning to control line and heavy mineral pigments in the painstaking “meticulous brush” manner. In the 1980s, he began to experiment with bold, gestural brushwork and the uncontrollable effects of mixing ink with white acrylic. In recent years, Zheng has used this technique, now a core part of his practice, to explore the landscape tradition. Unfolding Landscape renders both natural forms and natural forces out of the accidental interactions of his materials—fractals and capillaries read as tree branches, gray eddies as clouds, blocks of black ink as cliffs. Though apparently driven by the artist’s gesture, Zheng cedes much of the creative power to these natural interactions."
Dish_with_figures_in_a_landscape,"On this dish, a lady, her maid, and two young attendants walk toward a gentleman standing in a pavilion on a moonlit night. The scene suggests a romantic tryst and may derive from a woodcut illustration of a popular novel of the period."
"Sword,_Scabbard,_and_Belt_Hook","The sinuous wood-grain pattern running down the center of the blade is among the most intricate and beautiful on any Tibetan sword in existence. The gold-and-silver decoration of the hilt and scabbard is also of the highest quality for the period. Lieutenant Edward Henry Lenon (1838–1893) captured the sword in China at the Battle of North Taku Fort on August 21, 1860, during the Second Opium War. Lenon was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in this battle.This sword is important for the quality and distinctiveness of its pattern welded blade; as an excellent example of a Tibetan sword made to be worn suspended from a sword belt in the Chinese fashion; for its overall state of preservation; and for its interesting provenance. The pattern welding technique used in the forging of the vast majority of traditional Tibetan blades results in a characteristic surface appearance consisting of a series of alternating light and dark v-shaped lines referred to as a ""hairpin"" pattern. This example is exceptional among the few Tibetan blades that vary from this norm. In addition, the great length of the blade and the style of mounting made to be worn in the Chinese fashion associate it with a small group of similarly outfitted Tibetan swords, all with highly decorated hilts and scabbards.The hilt consists of an iron trefoil-shaped pommel with broad, flat sides; a grip wrapped horizontally in plain silver wire; an iron collar at the base of the grip; and an iron guard with rounded ends, cusped edges, down turned sides and an open, hollow interior. The sides of the pommel and the grip collar are damascened in gold (gold wire burnished onto to a finely crosshatched ground) with short repeating diagonal bands containing a stylized swastika pattern. In the center of the back of the pommel there is a small iron ring attached to a circular petal-shaped silver base. The front of the pommel is blank, but was originally decorated with a coral or turquoise stone set in silver. In the center of the grip collar there is an inset gilt copper plaque with a symmetrical leaf motif. The top of the guard is decorated with a recessed band and the sides are chiseled with a repeating trefoil pattern; both the band and the trefoil pattern are damascened in gold. The straight single-edged blade has a short oblique tip and a prominent band of variegated pattern welding running from the base of the blade to approximately two inches from the tip.The long rectangular scabbard has an iron frame covering the full length of both sides and the bottom. A recessed border runs the entire length of the front of the frame and is chiseled with a repeating scroll motif damascened in gold. The sides and bottom of the frame are damascened in gold with short repeating diagonal bands containing a stylized swastika pattern. The back of the frame is undecorated. The top six inches and the bottom nine inches of the front of the scabbard are covered by an inset pierced gilt copper panel of lush scrolling foliage and blossoms. Between the panels the wooden core of the scabbard is covered in green leather over two parallel concave channels running lengthwise on either side of a central ridge. The entire length of the back of the scabbard is covered in green leather. Two iron suspension brackets, chiseled and damascened in gold, are attached to the top edge of the frame for the straps from the sword belt. Each bracket has a short pivoting crossbar in the center. A decorative band wraps around the scabbard at each bracket and comprises a hemispherical coral bead set in a gilt copper circular bezel edged with petals and on top of a leafy silver base. The back strap is incised with a simple Greek key motif.The matching belt hook is made of iron highlighted with gold damascened decoration. It comprises a small buckle attached to a swivel hook that rotates at the top of a short rectangular slot, which is hinged to a large open loop."
Hilt_of_a_Ritual_Sword,"Originally fitted with a proportionately small blade, perhaps ten inches long, this hilt symbolizes the Sword of Wisdom, used to sever ties to spiritual and temporal ignorance and drive out the demons of negative thoughts and actions, particularly in the context of rituals associated with the Buddhist deities Manjushri, Padmasambhava, and Palden Lhamo. In addition to the use of such swords in actual rituals and ceremonies, iconographically, swords of this type appear in Tibetan scroll paintings (thang ka), wall murals, sculptures and other works of art, usually wielded by protective deities. They are also depicted among the objects required for votive or ritual use and are shown in great detail in a manuscript of ritual practices prepared for the Great Fifth Dalai Lama in the seventeenth century.The hilt is cast in one piece, with decoration in low relief accented by engraved details. The pommel has a trilobate or trefoil form and probably represents the Three-Eyed Gem (Tibetan,nor bu mig gsum pa), which is derived from the Chineseju-imotif and is one of a group of auspicious symbols known in Tibet as the Seven Gems (norbu cha bdun). It is decorated on the front with three dots framed by curly leaves or scrolls. The sides and back of the pommel are plain and there is a square opening at the top. The grip swells at the center and is round in cross section. It is decorated all the way around with two rows of stylized lotus petals. The borders or collars at the top and bottom of the grip consist of a continuous circle of triple petal orju-isymbols set on a beaded ring. At the base of the grip the guard is a very leonine form ofkirttimukhamask (Tibetan,tsi pa Ta) with a short downward curving leafy scroll extending from either side of the mouth. Ringlets of curly hair create an arc across the top of the back of the guard. Two locks or tendrils extend upward from the base, representing hair on the lower lip or chin of the mask. The bottom of the guard is open to accommodate the tang and shoulders of its missing blade. The opening is framed by teeth and fangs indicating the opening as the mouth of the mask, as is typical on hilts of this type."
Textile_with_floral_medallion,"The “treasure floral medallion” on this textile is one of the most popular designs of the Tang dynasty. The design, which consists of a composite blossom at center surrounded by a quatrefoil pattern on the four sides, is used not only in textiles but also in metalwork and ceramics. Its structured rendering reflects West and Central Asian artistic traditions introduced to China via the fabled Silk Road."
Section_of_a_Valance,The iridescence of this valance's peacock feather pattern was achieved with actual peacock feathers. The feathers were wrapped around a silk core and the resulting threads couched into place.
Cup_Stand_with_the_Eight_Buddhist_Treasures,"The objects resting on lotus buds on the interior of this cup stand represent seven of the Eight Buddhist Treasures: a wheel, an endless knot, a conch shell, a victory banner, lotus flowers, a pair of fish, and a treasure vase. (The traditional eighth treasure, a parasol, has been substituted here by a pair of elephant tusks.) After the fourteenth century these symbols, not necessarily in a group of eight, appeared on metalwork, porcelains, and textiles in China and Tibet."
"Girdle_Set_with_Dragon,_Clouds_and_Waves","A fan case, watch cover, flat envelope, watch case, and folding case comprise this girdle set of accessories that hung from a man's belt. The set shows the continuation and expansion of a Yuan-dynasty (1279–1368) tradition of silk tapestry fans decorated with dragons among clouds."
"Scroll_Cover_with_Animals,_Birds,_and_Flowers","A classic example of Song tapestry, this elegant scroll cover resembles a famous uncut piece (now in Liaoning Provincial Museum, China). This tapestry entered the Museum’s collection as the handscroll cover for the masterpiece Old Trees, Level Distance by Guo Xi (ca. 1020–ca. 1090). The placement of the animals in the pattern illustrates a strong connection with tapestries from Central Asia, which may have served as the source for the introduction of the tapestry technique to China."
Panel_with_the_moon_goddess_and_attendants,"This ornate brocade represents the celestial garden on the moon, where the goddess Chang’e (dressed in a red robe and blue skirt) is accompanied by attendants bearing a scroll, flower vase, lingzhi magic fungus, and ruyi scepter, respectively. Her identity is revealed by the rabbits at her feet and the osmanthus branch in her hand."
Jar_with_floral_scrolls_and_wrapped-cloth_design_(one_of_a_pair),"In the early decades of the eighteenth century, artists developed a new palette of opaque enamels that could produce novel decorative effects. In this example, the design mimics the appearance of a vessel with a fine textile tied around it, alluding to the East Asian practice of wrapping gifts in textiles. Wrapped-cloth (baofu) designs were also found on lacquer objects of the period."
Panel_with_a_Phoenix_and_Birds_in_a_Rock_Garden,"The eight treasures at the top of this panel, which are auspicious motifs derived from Buddhism, reinforce the meaning of the main image—a phoenix surrounded by smaller birds, symbolizing a virtuous monarch or leader welcomed by followers. This massive panel was hung over a wall to demonstrate the owner’s power and luxury, reflected in the rich colors and extraordinary craftsmanship."
Buddha_Amitabha_Descending_from_His_Pure_Land,"The imagery in this painting shows the Buddha Amitabha descending from his Pure Land to welcome the soul of a recently deceased individual into his paradisiacal abode. Amitabha is one of several Buddhas who create and maintain such realms, and paintings of Amitabha (either alone or attended by bodhisattvas) were among the most widely produced images in China from the twelfth to the fourteenth century. Here, the Buddha stands on two lotuses and holds his right hand in a gesture of welcome. He wears a green undergarment with a wide hem decorated with floral patterns and a red monastic shawl with gold bands. The abstracted folds of drapery on the right arm, the transparency of the green garment as it falls over the arm, and the figure's bean-shaped face are characteristic of the thirteenth century."
Festival_badge_with_five-clawed_dragon_surrounded_by_chrysanthemums,"In this festival badge, worn by an official during court ceremonies, a dragon rises from a stylized primordial mountain landscape amid supernatural clouds. The inclusion of the fall-blooming chrysanthemum suggests that the badge was to be used for one of the autumn festivals."
Boating_amid_Snowy_Streams_and_Mountains,"Like many professional painters trained in family workshops, Lan Meng carried on the style established by his famous father, Lan Ying (1585–ca. 1664). Based in his hometown of Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province and center of the so-called Zhe school of commercial painting, Lan Meng specialized in monumental landscapes executed in mineral pigments on silk, but he also created intimate works on paper in the styles of fourteenth-century scholar-artists.Lan Meng's extant paintings date from 1643 to 1671; during the mid-1660s, he worked in the capital city of Beijing, where this painting was created. Snowscapes, featuring white pigment highlights on tree branches, were a particular specialty. Typically, Lan Meng attributed his inspiration to the Tang-dynasty poet-painter Wang Wei (699–759), whom the late Ming painter and critic Dong Qichang (1555–1636) regarded as the patriarch of scholar painting. But no reliable work by Wang had survived into the seventeenth century. Instead, Lan Meng evoked his memory by combining a tenth-century composition—tall mountains alongside a deep recession—with a landscape idiom derived from the scholar-painter Huang Gongwang (1269–1354)."
Jar_with_dragon_and_stylized_character_for_longevity_(shou),"The Ming emperor Jiajing was known for his fervent interest in Daoism, in which longevity is a cherished goal. This magnificent jar, fired in the imperial workshop, marries the imperial aesthetic with Jiajing’s Daoist sensibility. The stylized character for longevity (shou) is chased by two five-clawed dragons, symbols of imperial power."
Snuff_Bottle_with_European_Woman_and_Child,"Jesuit missionaries brought snuff, or powdered tobacco, to China in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century. Its use spread quickly, leading to a need for small containers to hold it. Snuff bottles were produced in large numbers and in an astonishing variety of media during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Not all of the snuff bottles were functional. Many were collected for their exoticism, as the eighteenth century was a time of fascination with foreign, especially Western, taste."
Octagonal_box_with_scene_of_immortals,Boxes of this type were often fitted with an interior tray with recesses for holding cups; the tray rested on a ledge at the top of the box but under the cover. The gathering of Daoist immortals pictured on the lid was appropriate for a box used to serve wine at birthday banquets.
Dish_with_long-tailed_birds_and_flowers,"A sophisticated example of the two-bird design, the compact composition of this dish features flowers and long-tailed birds (shoudai, or paradise flycatchers)—a symbol of a rewarding career and long life—carved in a three-dimensional effect."
Theatrical_Costume_for_the_Role_of_a_Buddhist_Cleric,"This colorful costume is a theatrical version of a jiasha, or Buddhist vestment, usually rectangular in shape and worn draped over one shoulder. It maintains many of the conventions of Buddhist clerical dress—namely, the piece is divided into parts: columns and a framework surrounded by a border with additional squares at the corners."
Duster_with_the_flowers_of_four_seasons,"This grouping of bamboo, chrysanthemums, orchids, and plum blossoms has rich symbolic meaning. Together, the plants represent both the passing of the seasons and virtues such as perseverance, modesty, purity, and nobility of spirit that were esteemed by the literati class. A member of that class would have used a whisk like this one."
Guan_Yu,"Guan Yu (d. A.D. 219), a warrior of the late Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 220) renowned for his valor and faithfulness, was later venerated as a saint in the Daoist pantheon. Elevated to the rank of emperor (di) by the Wanli emperor (r. 1573–1620) of the Ming dynasty, Guandi, as he was thenceforth known, served as a virtual patron saint of the Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty, who erected numerous shrines in his honor throughout China. In this image, Emperor Guan is shown descending from the heavens accompanied by his two attendants. He is identified by an inscription written in gold in the upper right: “Overseer of the Gate, Sage-Emperor Lord Guan.”The painting, which comes from a set of religious images used in “water and land” (shuilu) rituals, is distinguished by its high level of craftsmanship, intricate detail, and lavish use of mineral pigments. An inscription in the lower right, “Respectfully commissioned by the imperial prince Zhuang,” shows that the painting was the product of the imperial workshop. Judging from its style, it was probably commissioned by the first holder of that title, the powerful Manchu prince Boggodo (1650–1723), whose grandfather Abahai (1592–1643), was the Qing dynasty founder."
Lozenge-shaped_dish_with_garden_scene,"A scholar-gentleman and an attendant holding a qin zither (a stringed instrument) walk away from another figure in a nearby pavilion. The pair are either coming from or going to a festive event that would have included music, painting, poetry, and wine."
Bamboo_grove,"Created at the time of political and social turmoil that accompanied the disintegration of the Mongol Yuan and the establishment of the native Ming dynasty, this painting reflects a common theme found in scholar paintings of the day: the yearning for a safe haven.Bamboo Grove portrays ""this gentleman""—bamboo—as the reclusive companion of rocks and water. While earlier painters depicted bamboo as a tactile object and a moral symbol, Shen's portrayal suggests bamboo's ability to create a mood of tranquility through its delicate shadows and gentle movement and the soft rustling sounds of its leaves. Growing wild or in a garden, it evokes thoughts of purity and freedom."
Huaisu_in_the_Banana_Grove,"Gu Yün was the leader of a group of painters working in Shanghai during the last quarter of the 19th century who called themselves ""The Nine Friends"" in imitation of Dong Qichang's (1555–1636) literati circle. the group included Wu Dacheng, Lu Hui, Ren Yü, Jin Lan and Ni Dian, all represented in this exhibition.In Gu's portrayal of Huai Su (737–?), the Tang monk is seated in the banana grove he called ""Green Sky Temple,"" practicing calligraphy on nature's affordable paper—the banana leaf. Flywhisk in hand and drowsy from effort and perhaps drink, he wipes moisture from his brow, giving the impression that he is preparing for a nap. This amusing and very human portrayal is typical of the 19th century populist artist's approach to venerable and traditional subjects."
Woman's_Theatrical_Jacket,"Designed for a young female role, this jacket is remarkable for having intact sleeve extensions known as “water sleeves.” Actors would gracefully manipulate these sleeves as they danced or narrated the story during performances. Allover applique of colorful damask lozenges and an exquisite embroidered border further highlight the magnificence of this upscale costume."
Monk_of_Longmen_in_Ni_Zan_Style,"The canon of approved painting styles set down by Dong Qichang (1555–1636) in the late Ming continued to influence artists through the opening years of the 19th century. Wan Shanglin's model is Ni Zan (1301–1374), the ultimate man of letters, and Wan's smoky ink and sensitive brushline are a respectable homage.Wan's inscription on this painting however, reveals a spirit characteristic of the 19th century, one that questioned the authenticity of accepted classics in literature, morals, history and painting. Wan writes that for eight or nine years he studied two paintings of the Longmen monk purported to be by Ni Zan and was still unable to decide whether they were genuine. His own painting he says, is done from memory of the two pictures. By implication, his version must be judged by its own quality, for fidelity to a copy, even of an orthodox master, would be of little importance."
Textile_with_floral_medallions,"This extremely rare and elegant textile is identical to an eighth-century example preserved in Shōsōin, a famous treasury in the Todai-ji temple in Nara, Japan, that houses imperial gifts from Tang-dynasty China. These works were given to the temple by the Japanese Empress Kōmyō in 756 and continue to serve as important pieces for the study of the art of Tang China."
Jacket_for_a_Theatrical_Costume,"Three of these exquisite jackets are known to exist: two are in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum and a third is in the Qing court collection of theatrical costumes of the Palace Museum, Beijing. All three have the same delicate floral pattern and identical seals and inscriptions on their linings.The jackets were made in the textile bureau in Suzhou as tribute objects for the imperial court. They were part of an ensemble, perhaps with a skirt or other garment, and they were worn for performances by the Jingshan theatrical troupe in the Changchun Palace, within the Forbidden City."
Theatrical_Robe_for_the_Role_of_a_Guard,"This costume, for the role of a guard, mimics armor. Animal heads decorate the geometric armorlike pattern at the shoulder and thigh. Unusual winged animals appear at the waist, powerful tigers at the hem. A similar costume, in white, is in the Qing court collection of theatrical costumes of the Palace Museum, Beijing."
Square_with_Fantastic_Animal,"Gold thread accentuates the eyes and single curved horn of this spotted deerlike animal, and the flamelike emanations coming off its body announce its supernatural status. It runs through an abstracted landscape with clouds overhead and a low groundline."
Daoist_Robe_of_Descent_(Jiang_yi),"This vestment for a Daoist priest is densely embroidered with figures representing the Daoist pantheon. The deities float on clouds amid cranes in flight. The pantheon shown here had remained largely unchanged since the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368).Scholars suggest that the layout of a jiang yi corresponds to the layout of a Daoist temple, with minor deities represented on the front of the robe (corresponding to the south wall of a temple) and major deities on the back of the robe (north wall). The entrance to a temple, like the front opening of this robe, has a tiger on one side (the west) and a dragon on the other (the east).Major figures on the back of the robe include the Jade Emperor (the large figure at the center back) and the Three Pure Ones, seen at the center top flanked by the sun and moon. Minor figures, shown on the front of the robe, are identifiable through various attributes. For example, the Lord of the White Tiger Star appears on the front left near the center, accompanied by a tiger."
Panel_with_Peonies_and_Butterfly,"Gold sparkles through small, geometric patterns imposed on a design of flowers and a butterfly. This combination of geometric patterns and embroidered designs is one of the hallmarks of needleloop embroidery."
Man's_Audience_Robe_(Chaofu),"A chaofu, or audience robe, featuring a fully pleated skirt was the most formal type of men's court dress. Sumptuary regulations set in the mid-eighteenth century dictated that only the emperor and heir apparent could wear robes emblazoned with five-clawed dragons, but in the nineteenth century, these mandates were often overlooked. Blue-black audience robes were worn by Qing nobles, high-ranking civil and military officials, and imperial guards."
Buddhist_Guardian_King,"The elaborately dressed figure with a flaming halo holding a bow and arrow is one of the Buddhist guardian kings of the four cardinal directions. (The arrow suggests he may be associated with the east, despite the inscription on the mounting, which identifies him as the guardian of the west.)The face and hands as well as several segments of the costume, including parts of the body armor and helmet and the swirling ribbons to the figure's left and right, are made from applied textiles with embroidered details. The features of his broad face, which is mustached and lightly bearded, include a prominent nose and fierce, watchful eyes-characteristics often found in East Asian guardian figures."
Vase,"The delicate shades of pink found in the lush peonies on the surface of this vase help date the piece to the eighteenth century. The color pink was introduced from Europe to China around 1720 and quickly become part of the decoration of cloisonné enamels, as well as porcelains painted with overglaze enamel pigments such as the famous famille rose wares."
Velvet_Panel,"Velvet panels such as this example were sewn together to form a complete pattern and then used as decorative hangings or carpets. Here, the concentric bands of ornament consist, from left to right, of lotuses, foliate dragons, chrysanthemums, and a continuous fretwork incorporating the swastika—a form of the auspicious character wan, signifying ten thousand years."
Dish_with_European_Woman_and_Child,"Although the subject of this scene cannot be identified, the chubbiness of the child and his lack of clothing suggest that he was inspired by European depictions of cherubs, the angelic figures often shown as attendants of Greek or Roman gods. It seems likely that the decoration of this dish was inspired by a European print of a goddess from the classical world."
Snuff_bottle_with_woman_in_a_garden,"Tiny fragments of mother-of-pearl were inlaid into a black lacquer base to create the scene of a woman resting in a garden. She is seated on a stool beneath a tree, and a table with a flower arrangement and other implements is set before her. Even more miniscule pieces of mother-of-pearl define the collarlike motifs at the neck of the bottle."
Fantastic_animal,The form of this tapir-like animal and the abstract curvilinear patterns on its body can both be traced to vessels produced during China’s Bronze Age.
Snuff_Bottle_with_Seven_Sages_of_the_Bamboo_Grove,"Represented often in the visual arts, the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove lived during the third century B.C. and were known for their scholarship, writing, and musical abilities. They are understood as exemplars of an unfettered and less corrupt lifestyle removed from the intrigue of the court. Here, the delicacy of the tiny bamboo stalks in the background and the use of these stalks to render depth exemplify the skillful bamboo carving characteristic of the eighteenth century."
Woman's_Ensemble_of_Robe_and_Coat_with_Shou_Medallions,"This ensemble of robe and coat constittued formal wear for the wife of a nobleman or official on auspicious occasions such as birthdays. The darker, simpler coat which fastens down the front, was worn over the more elaborate robe. the ensemble is decorated with large medallions of the character shou, meaning longevity. This version of shou incorporates the swastika, wan, denoting ten thousand years."
Hat_Feather_with_Box,"This elaborate, tubular lacquered box was intended as a storage container for an official's hat feather. The large, encircled characters in archaic style on one side of the container refer to ""three eyes""—a hat feather with three peacock-feather eyes, which signified the highest honor. The work is an example of the Qing period's enthusiasm for archaism."
Ornaments_for_a_Woman's_Hat,"Ornaments such as these, which were most likely part of a larger set, would have been attached to a hat made of silk thread on wire and worn by women at court. Unlike more formal headdresses decorated with gold ornaments, hats of this type were widely used. One of the Qianlong Emperor's daughters received thirty such hats as part of her dowry."
Sleeveless_Jacket,"The roundels on this sleeveless velvet jacket incorporate the crane, an auspicious symbol of longevity, and have an outer border of interlocking circles, representing an endless string of coins. This garment was appropriately worn for birthday celebrations. The presence of a stand-up collar suggests a late Qing date for the piece."
Woman's_Informal_Jacket_with_Antiquities_in_Medallions,"Every roundel embroidered on this jacket is different, but each one has the ""hundred antiques"" as its theme. The vessels and objects in the roundels are supplemented not only by flowers and fruit but also, occasionally, by fantastic or symbolic animals—for example, the oxsymbolizing strength in the upper roundel, and the fantastic lion, which is accompanied by a bat representing good fortune, seen in the roundel at the lower right. At the bottom of the jacket, sketchily embroidered rocks, trees, and flowers form a scene of a Daoist (Taoist) paradise inhabited by cranes and deer."
Incense_Burner_from_a_Set_of_Five-Piece_Altar_Set_(Wugong),"Cloisonné is the technique of creating designs on metal vessels with colored glass paste placed within enclosures made of copper or bronze wires, which have been bent or hammered into the desired patterns. Known as cloisons (French for ""partitions""), the enclosures are generally either glued or soldered onto the metal body. The glass paste, or enamel—which gets its color from metallic oxides—is painted into the contained areas of the design. The vessel is usually fired at a relatively low temperature, about 800 degrees Celsius. Enamels tend to shrink during firing, and the process is repeated several times to fill in the design. Once this process is completed, the surface of the vessel is rubbed until the edges of the cloisons are visible."
Bell_(niuzhong),"Sets of bells were an important aspect of Zhou bronze production. They were used in musical accompaniment for ritual ceremonies and for less solemn occasions.Ancient clapperless bells, which were sounded with mallets, are members of the zhong family. A yongzhong, recognized by its highly raised rims, is a type of bell found in great sets of graduated chimes known as bianzhong. Although it has a slightly raised rim, this bell is suspended from a ring rather than a long handle, making it a cross between the yongzhong and the bo types. Each face of the bell has three rows of bosses in the form of coiled serpents further divided by trapezoidal panels with faint dragon motifs. The elegant decoration and advanced acoustical properties of Zhou-dynasty bells illustrate the extraordinary technical sophistication of metallurgy in China during this period."
Candlestick_from_a_Set_of_Five-Piece_Altar_Set_(Wugong),"Cloisonné is the technique of creating designs on metal vessels with colored glass paste placed within enclosures made of copper or bronze wires, which have been bent or hammered into the desired patterns. Known as cloisons (French for ""partitions""), the enclosures are generally either glued or soldered onto the metal body. The glass paste, or enamel—which gets its color from metallic oxides—is painted into the contained areas of the design. The vessel is usually fired at a relatively low temperature, about 800 degrees Celsius. Enamels tend to shrink during firing, and the process is repeated several times to fill in the design. Once this process is completed, the surface of the vessel is rubbed until the edges of the cloisons are visible."

Once this process is completed, the surface of the vessel is rubbed until the edges of the cloisons are visible."
Daoist_deity_Zhenwu,"The tortoise at the base of the sculpture identifies this figure as Zhenwu, an important Daoist deity who also was worshipped in Buddhist traditions. Zhenwu became particularly popular during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), when he was revered as a protector of both the state and the imperial family. His role as a guardian reflects his association with the north, the direction from which China was constantly threatened by neighboring peoples from Central Asia."
Water_Buffalo,One of the innovations of Shang jade carving was the creation of figures in the round. The artists further ornamented this water buffalo with spirals that recall bronze decorative motifs. They created the illusion of the patterns being raised by engraving the surface with two slightly beveled parallel lines. A hole piercing the figure’s mouth and lower lip suggests it was probably worn as an ornament or a talisman.
Vase_with_landscape_and_poem_by_Zhu_Xi,"This vase was made in the seventeenth century, but it is inscribed with a poem written by the influential neo-Confucian thinker Zhu Xi (1130–1200) of the Southern Song dynasty. It reads:On a pleasant day, I seek fragrance on the banks of the Si River;The boundless sunlit landscape appears suddenly new.Easily recognize the face of the eastern wind,As myriad purples, thousands of reds—all are [the appearances of] spring.—Translation after Yang Zhiyi"
Lozenge-Shaped_Tray,Simple lacquer objects comprising a wood base covered with black or brown lacquer were used widely during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.
Rectangular_box_with_scene_of_a_visit,Depicted on the top of this box is a scene of a visit between a man in official costume and an elderly gentleman. The paintings on the sides illustrate popular stories.
Wine_pot_with_figures_in_a_landscape,"While lacquer on metal is an aspect of the revival of metalworking in China during the seventeenth century, the combination of thin, tinted pieces of mother-of-pearl with gold foil derives from refinements in lacquer technology that can be dated somewhat earlier, to the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. An inscription on the base of this pot indicates that it was produced by, or under the supervision of, an artist named Shang Yiliang. Although details of his identity remain unclear, Shang is one of a handful of metal artists who signed their works. It is reasonable to assume that his work was well regarded, and probably collected, during his lifetime."
Box_with_scene_of_bathing_children,"This tiny box, previously thought to date to the sixteenth century, can be reassigned to the fourteenth after comparison with an example bearing an image of the poet Tao Qian, which dates to the first half of the fourteenth century. The large, unarticulated shapes of the rocks and the use of a single pattern for the low-relief background are similar on both boxes, as are the thick incisions used to define the figures' clothing and the large oval faces with nondescript features."
Dish_with_Antiquities,"The phrase inlaid into the bottom of this small dish reads “for the delectation of the jade hall” (yuntang jiawan), indicating that it was a private commission. This inscription alludes to the collection of the infamous Ming-dynasty Prime Minister Yan Song (1480–1566). Because of his greed and lack of scruples, Yan was able to amass an astonishing collection of antiquities. In an ironic transformation, he instead became known as an icon of good taste in later ages."
Tray_with_figures_in_a_landscape,"The two gentlemen on horseback and their attendants are presumably traveling to join the four figures drinking beneath the pine tree at top. The crane standing near the attendants serving wine and the deer resting at right are symbols of immortality. They add an otherworldly element to the scene, which represents either a paradisiacal realm or the retirement villa of a senior official equipped with the trappings of such a magical environment."
Mount_Huang,"This collaborative album by photographer Michael Cherney and painter Arnold Chang challenges expectations by rendering a famous and easily recognizable site—the Yellow Mountains (Huangshan)—as a series of call-and-response abstractions between the lens and the brush. Cherney first took a photograph of Huangshan, then extracted from it a horizontal slice that he divided into twelve pieces (as seen in the illustration). Cherney then sent these pieces to Chang, who, after several months of contemplation, produced painted responses that run the spectrum from dry and descriptive to splashy and almost entirely abstract."
Scroll_Cover_for_Imperial_Calligraphy,"This wonderful textile illustrates the continuation of the use of luxurious tapestries as covers for paintings and calligraphies. The inscription states that it was produced to accompany the Qianlong Emperor’s calligraphy of his own essay discussing the difficulty and ease of founding and maintaining an empire. As a tailor-made cover for an imperial work, the tapestry is superb: the body of the dragon is executed in gold thread, and the flowers and leaves are rendered in subtle hues and shades."
Mythical_realm,"The land of crystalline blue-green mountains, towering palaces, and auspicious cranes depicted here lies somewhere beyond the human realm. This tapestry would have been appropriate to hang for a celebratory occasion, such as a birthday, as the pleasant vision of the immortal realms would have added to the festive atmosphere. Sections of the details were painted rather than woven, a labor- and cost-saving method often employed on tapestries from this period."
Table_Screen_with_Scene_of_Imperial_Traveling_Palace,The inscription on one side of this screen was composed by the Qianlong Emperor in honor of the traveling palace that is detailed on the other side.
Rank_Badge_with_Qilin_(?),"The identity of the animal on this rank badge is not completely clear. Most of its characteristics match those of a qilin-head like a dragon, two horns, scales on its body, tail like a Chinese lion's, and hooves. However, the animal's legs are very short by comparison with those of a more typical qilin, such as 36.65.6."
Figure_of_a_Dog,"This glazed pottery figure depicts a dog with a menacing look, marked by its raised ears, staring eyes, and tightly clenched jaws. Its studded collar, a fashionable accessory of the time, suggests that the animal was a pet with a wealthy master. During the Han dynasty, it was common practice to bury pottery models of dogs in graves, in the belief that they would keep the deceased humans company in the afterlife."
Scholar’s_rock_with_overhang_and_perforation,"This natural piece of limestone, gray with buff, caramel, and burnt sienna markings, resembles a rugged peak in miniature. Its craggy form evokes a tall overhanging cliff atop a cryptic cave. Its rough surface, layered with fissures and interspersed with indentations, reflects eons of natural erosion. It sits on a wooden stand in the form of intertwined roots, made precisely to fit its base.The object’s dramatic silhouette and fine linear texture are characteristic of the highly prized ornamental rocks from Mount Qilian in China’s northwestern provinces of Gansu and Qinghai. The design and execution of the wooden stand embody the refinement of craftsmanship peculiar to 18th-century Chinese wood carving."
Camel,"Although the camel is not native to China, representations of the two-humped Central Asian camel are frequently found in Chinese ceramic tomb sculpture. This pack animal was an indispensable carrier of goods on the Silk Road that linked China with the regions to her west. In all likelihood, the demonic masks that dominate the load of the camel here were intended to ward off evil."
Sheep_and_herd_boy,"Under a pair of willow trees, eighteen sheep spread across a summer meadow, some munching on grass, some nursing, others relaxing. While they rest, the young shepherd climbs one of the willows in pursuit of the contents of a bird’s nest. The overall tone is highly auspicious: the number eighteen suggests prosperity, while the mothers with children point to a wish for many offspring. The symbolism would have made this a suitable gift, particularly in the Year of the Ram."
Waves_in_the_moonlight,"This composition calls to mind paintings of the tidal bore, an annual event where exceptionally high tides push into the Qiantang River in Hangzhou, resulting in a powerful tidal wave that runs up the course of the river. When the imperial capital was moved to Hangzhou during the Southern Song dynasty, the tidal bore became a subject for court painters, and this painting was likely created in that milieu. Most paintings of this type include at least a patch of shore for context, but the unidentified painter of this fan places us in the river itself, with only the moon to provide a sense of direction."
Misty_Landscape,"Wind whips through the fall foliage of a dense stand of riverside trees, blowing leaves toward the water. Two boats are moored at the water’s edge, and one more can be seen just offshore, but no human figures are present in this windswept, autumnal landscape."
Head_of_a_Bodhisattva,"The delicate modeling of the hair and face provide a sense of the sophisticated sculptural production at Rawak. Early photographs show that this bodhisattva originally had an elaborate topknot, suggestive of the figure of the future Buddha Maitreya. This bodhisattva also had flowers in his hair, earrings, and an elaborate halo embellished with multiple Buddha images (similar to 30.32.33 and 30.32.44). The use of unfired red clay is a technical feature shared with late Afghan Buddhist imagery."
Lamellar_Shoulder_Defenses,"The Met’s collection of armor and weapons from Tibet is the most comprehensive and well published in the world. This promised gift of a lamellar shoulder defense, made of iron lamellae joined by leather laces, adds yet another great strength to it. This defense for the neck and shoulders is the most complete example known of one the rarest forms of iron lamellar armor from Tibet. Lamellar armor is characterized by upwardly overlapping rows of small, finger-sized plates (lamellae), in which the individual lamellae, and the rows they create, are joined together by an intricate system of leather lacing, requiring no other internal support fabric or lining for its structure or functionality. It is an extremely old and widespread form of body armor, with archaeological examples of leather, bronze, and later iron lamellar armor found from East Asia to the Middle East, into Western Europe, over a period of more than a thousand years. Literary and iconographic evidence documents the regular use of lamellar armor across the Mongol empire by the thirteenth century. Virtually all surviving examples, from a non-archaeological context, however, come from Tibet, where it seems to have been the predominant form of body armor from about the fourteenth century to the seventeenth century, and remained in intermittent use into the twentieth century.Complete examples of Tibetan lamellar armor are rare and usually consist of a sleeveless coat with a distinct waist and comprise twelve to fourteen rows of lamellae. A few surviving examples have attached shoulder pieces and, in one instance, complete sleeves. A removable or independent neck and shoulder defense of the kind presented here is extremely rare, with only two or three fragmentary examples being known. However, the type, and how it was worn, is recorded in great detail inEighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute: The Story of Lady Wenji, an early fifteenth century Chinese painted scroll in The Met (acc. no. 1973.120.3). The scroll depicts several warriors in full lamellar armor equipped with shoulder pieces of this kind. In one particularly relevant scene, a seated commander is shown wearing complete armor, but with the neck and shoulder defense removed and being carried by his attendant. This invaluable pictorial evidence confirms the exact nature and use of this extremely rare form of lamellar armor.The lamellar armor is designed to cover the base of the neck, shoulders, and upper arms to about the elbows, mainly comprising a neck piece of a single row and two sleeves made up of eleven rows of iron lamellae joined by integral leather lacing. Seen from the outside, the lamellae of the neck piece overlap from right to left; the lamellae of the sleeves overlap from the back towards the front (left sleeve from right to left and right sleeve from left to right). The rows of the sleeves overlap upward and are laced in the typical manner for lamellar armor of this region and period. The individual lamellae measure about 2 ? in. by ? in. (7 x 1.9 cm) and are pierced with thirteen lacing holes each. The lamellae of the neck row are bent inward slightly to form a gentle curve and the row is fully lined with leather on its interior; there is a short row of ten lamellae loosely laced to the top edge of the center of the neck. The third row from the bottom of each sleeve is shorter by several lamellae on its inner aspect. There several colored textile laces arranged in a small loose bundle on the second row from the top of the right shoulder."
Flying_Celestial_Figure,These winged celestial beings show remarkable connections to the Western classical tradition. From comparable examples we know that these male figures were represented as flying down from the heavens to attend a Buddhist divinity.
Rank_Badge_with_Silver_Pheasant,"An exquisite example of Qing rank badge, this badge use minuscule pearls to render the white feathers of the bird in addition to extremely refined embroidery. The silver pheasant corresponds to the fifth civil rank."
Woman's_Robe_with_Phoenixes_and_a_Tree,"In ancient Chinese lore, phoenixes appear only during the reign of a just and benevolent emperor, signifying a time of peace and prosperity. Instead of singing in the paulownia tree of that tradition, however, the phoenixes decorating this Chinese robe flock among the branches of an imaginary tree blooming with flowers of all the seasons. Parts of the tree even seem to be turning into dragons. The supernatural theme continues at the hem, where two qilin—fantastic hooved animals—leap above the waves.The lanterns hanging from the tree branch at about hip level suggest that this colorfully embroidered garment may have been worn for the Lantern Festival in the middle of the first lunar month."
Rank_badge_with_crane,"The crane corresponds to the first civil rank. In this badge, embroidery in silk was supplemented with eye-catching beading. The crane's characteristic red head and the sun disk, for example, are rendered in small coral beads; the crane's body and some of the flowers are in pearls; and the crane's legs and bill are in green beads."
Woman's_Robe_of_State,"Known as chaopao, women's formal or state robes characteristically include an L-shaped seam between the collar and underarm fastenings that were most likely used to attach a long sleeveless coat over the garment.. This robe also features an attached collar, making it a complete set. Surviving examples of women's formal court robes are rare: not many were made, as women were not often included in court ceremonies. The unusual orange-yellow of the robe further indicates its high status. The original color, still well preserved inside, resembles that of a ripe apricot, a color designated only for the crown prince and his consorts."
Safe_Conduct_Pass_(Paiza)_with_Inscription_in_Phakpa_Script,"The openwork inscription on this circular plaque has been filled with silver to the extent that the characters project from the surface of the plaque on both sides; the inscription on the reverse is thus inverted. The type of script—used early on to write the Mongol language—is named for its inventor, Phakpa (1235–1280), the Tibetan monk and scholar who served as the imperial preceptor for the Mongol court during the reign of Khubilai Khan (1215–94). The inscription reads, “By the strength of Eternal Heaven, an edict of the Emperor [Khan]. He who has not respect shall be guilty.” The form of the pass (paiza), with its animal mask decoration, is similar to that of a Tibetan mirror for reflecting evil."
Emperor’s_twelve-symbol_festival_robe,"Official costumes in imperial China were highly regulated, and the decorative motifs of court outfits were specific to rank. Among the emblems used on the emperor’s ceremonial robes were the twelve imperial symbols, as seen on this example: the sun, the moon, constellations, mountains, a pair of dragons, birds, ritual cups, water weeds, millet, fire, an ax, and the symmetrical fu symbol. These symbols, said to have been used since ancient times, represent the emperor’s righteous rule over the universe. The festival robe, also known as a dragon robe, was used for various ceremonies, such as festival banquets and military inspections."
Festival_Robe,"A festival robe, or jifu pao, was worn during festivals, banquets, and other events held in the periods preceding significant sacrificial ceremonies. Only those woven for the emperor, their consorts, and the crown prince were called a “dragon robe” (longpao), and decorated with five-clawed dragons and certain auspicious symbols. The sun, moon, constellation, mountain, dragons, flowery bird, sacrificial cups, waterweed, millet, fire, ax, and the symbol of discrimination ""fu,"" seen on this robe, were reserved exclusively for imperial robes, as was the bright yellow color. They represent the emperor’s control over all elements of the universe. The powerful, vibrant, and fierce dragons embroidered on this robe date it to the second half of the eighteenth century, implying that it might have been made for the Emperor Qianlong (reigned 1736–95), one of the most famous rulers of the Qing dynasty."
Vase_with_Garden_Scene,"This vase illustrates the bustling life found along a garden stream, including women and children in pavilions, figures in a gazebo, and boaters."
Woman's_Informal_Coat_with_Large_Rosettes,"Roundels and rosettes have a long history in China, dating back to the seventh century. The embroidered rosettes on this robe are particularly notable for their fine detail. They are on a nearly hidden light-blue background and were set in, not applied to the surface of the garment, which features a subtly contrasting light-golden-yellow background embroidered with flowering branches. Exquisite robes such as this one were often refurbished for succeeding generations. The borders of this coat, for example, are from a later period."
Brush_pot_with_poem,"This poem by Zhang Yue (663–730) was composed during a banquet and is filled with literary and political allusions. The calligraphy was created by covering the white porcelain body with a resist, possibly paper or wax, before applying the blue glaze."
Theatrical_robe_for_a_female_Daoist_priest,"This robe with colorful patchwork was a typical costume for the role of a female Daoist priest. A similar robe now in the collection of the Palace Museum, in Beijing, bears ink inscriptions that indicate it was called a “rice-paddy robe,” as its patchwork resembles the irrigated lowlands where rice is grown. Embroidery featuring multiple flowers adds charm and further suggests that the robe was designed for a female character."
Purse_with_boys_playing,"On the back of this purse, boys run and tumble, surrounded by flowers, plants, birds, and deer. Woven freely into the silk, this design is an early example of children at play, a form that can be traced to Central Asia in the eighth century. The silk’s pattern is clearly scaled to fit small objects such as this purse."
Fan_with_Dragon,"According to a gazetteer of Beijing written at the end of the Yuan dynasty, the Ministry of Rites would present to the court, on the occasion of the Duanwu Festival (the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, now celebrated as the Dragon Boat Festival), tapestry fans with various pictorial subjects, including dragons in clouds. In this example, a dragon emerges from the clouds blowing a flaming pearl into the ocean."
Mythical_realm,"This land of crystalline blue-green mountains, towering palaces, and auspicious cranes lies somewhere beyond the human realm. This mythical scene would have been appropriate to hang for a celebratory occasion, such as birthdays, as the pleasant visions of the immortal realms would have added to the festive atmosphere. Sections of the details were painted rather than woven, a labor- and cost-saving method often employed on tapestries from this period."
Textile_fragment_with_boys_in_floral_scrolls,"This textile was meticulously woven with boys tucked among floral scrolls and lotus pods—a rebus for, or visual allusion to, progeny. In addition to the Buddhist belief in rebirth from the lotus, multiseeded lotus pods were also thought to be a symbol for plentiful offspring."
Woman’s_robe_decorated_with_cranes_amid_clouds,"Red-crowned cranes, symbols of long life, dance across the surface of this robe. Combined with the auspicious red ground, these birds would have made the garment an excellent choice for a birthday or other celebration."
Box_with_pommel_scroll_design,"A close examination of this box indicates that three layers of red lacquer were interspersed among the predominant black. The yellow background brings additional color to the vessel, which was used to hold documents. The object illustrates the taste for vibrant aesthetic combinations that characterizes the late Ming period."
Bowl_with_dragon,"A good number of lacquer wares from the Wanli period, including this bowl, bear marks with the specific year, which have made them important standards for the stylistic analysis of undated pieces from this period."
Section_of_a_Clapper_(Paiban),"In continuous use since the Tang dynasty, the paiban usually comprises two to six slabs of wood strung together at one end with a cord. It is held vertically and clapped to keep time. Here, a beautifully decorated single length of ivory preserves traces of its original red pigment. Red-colored ivory clappers are known in literature of the Northern Song dynasty (11th century)."
"Musical_Stone_with_Theme_of_the_""Hundred_Antiques""","The association of bells and stone chimes with ancient ritual made them ideal subjects for reproduction as decorative objects. In the late eighteenth century, when the supply of jade was plentiful, archaistic bells and fanciful stone chimes were made from the precious material. The fashion for this type of jade object probably began in the imperial workshops during the Qianlong reign (1736–95) and continued in commercial enterprises through the nineteenth century."
Village_and_Temples_in_Jiangnan,"Gold, azurite, and malachite are perfectly suited to this depiction of the verdant Jiangnan (""South of the [Yangzi] River"") landscape. In theforeground is a small village where travelers arriving by boat bow to one another or enjoy the view from a pavilion across a stream. Towering above the white-washed houses is the two-story hall of a temple; in the distance, other temples, one with a pagoda and freshly dyed red walls, nestle in the foothills."
Covered_Jar_(Hu),"During the Warring States period (475–221 B.C.), jades, bronze, textiles, musical instruments, books and other luxuries were often placed in tombs to serve the needs of the deceased in the afterlife. In the early Han dynasty pottery models known as mingqi or ""spirit goods"" began to be produced as substitutes for more valuable possessions, and to provide figures of servants, entertainers, livestock, pets, and vessels and other necessities for the tomb. Made of low-fired earthenware and painted with chalky mineral pigments that flake off when handled, this covered jar is too porous to hold liquids. The swirling cloud-like designs covering the vessel are thought to represent celestial mists through which the deceased would travel to join the immortals."
Tomb_Panel_with_Relief_of_Figures_in_a_Pavilion,"Distinguished by her larger size, bird-shaped cap, and flowing gown, the figure seated at the far left represents Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of the West. Thought to rule the land of the immortals (located somewhere to the west of China), Xiwangmu played a major role in Han funerary beliefs. The structured placement of Xiwangmu and her attendants in the pavilion is typical of later Han representations of heavenly courts, which under the influence of Confucianism, began to parallel the organization of earthly ones."
Rectangular_cauldron_(fangding),"In a departure from the usual symmetrical decor of Shang bronzes, this vessel features a single bird in profile. Six characters are cast on its inner wall: “Shu Hui [had] this vessel made for Gong Bo.”"
"Tiered_Box_with_Figural_Scenes,_Flowers,_and_Birds","The adorable girls peeking around the wall at the woman and dogs in the garden are found in at least two other works from the period. This scene likely illustrates a well-known moment from a literary work or a play. Every panel and column of the architecture is decorated with a distinct pattern, attesting to the painstaking labor needed to create the scene. Each of the sixteen cartouches on the sides shows different flowers and birds."
Seated_Buddha,"This Buddha image was using a mold. It exemplifies the Khotan taste for Gandharan classical drapery—here, juxtaposed with the local aesthetic, as seen in the representation of the face and hair."
Spring_Festival_on_the_River,"In the early twelfth century the court artist Zhang Zeduan painted a handscroll depicting the Northern Song capital of Bianliang (Kaifeng) at the time of the Spring Festival (Qingming jie). Zhang's painting, which lovingly and minutely describes the daily life of the capital's inhabitants, became the paradigm for more than forty later evocations of this theme. This version, which is longer, compositionally more complex, and more brilliantly colored than the Song original, reflects the stylistic innovations of the Suzhou professional painter Qiu Ying (ca. 1495–1552), whose signature has been added at the end. But there are several reasons for assigning the scroll to a later date. Not only is the execution less meticulous than that of genuine works by Qiu, but the addition of elaborate palaces, a display of horsemanship and archery skills, an imperial procession, and a hunt— none of which appear in the original—point to the influence of imperially sponsored commemorative paintings that originated with the Southern Inspection Tour of the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662–1722)."
Vessel_in_shape_of_a_crouching_tiger,"Fanciful vessels such as this were produced primarily in south China; however, examples in both clay and bronze have been found in the north as well. The shape has a long history and was first produced in the second and third centuries for pouring liquids."
Incense_Burner,"Much Chinese art is informed by a complex understanding of the past. The shape of this incense burner is a fascinating example of this tendency, having been derived from a ceramic of the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279) that was itself inspired by an archaic ritual vessel used during the Bronze Age. The addition of a matching stand, on the other hand, can be traced to the seventeenth century, as can the alchemical treatment of the bronze, which creates a sense of surface depth comparable to that found in glazed porcelains."
Festival_Robe,"The unusual green tone of the robe derives from peacock feather filaments that were individually twisted by hand onto the threads used to embroider the garment. Robes made in this laborious fashion were valued both for the work entailed and for their exotic quality as the peacock is not native to China. Textual sources trace the use of peacock feather filaments to the fifth century. The earliest surviving examples are fragments unearthed from the tomb of Ming Emperor Wanli (1572–1620) in a suburb of Beijing in the 1950s. A robe similar to this one is now in the collection of the Palace Museum, Beijing."
Rank_Badge_with_Peacock,"The peacock shown on this badge corresponds to the third rank of civil official. Fittingly, thread made of peacock feathers was used in the embroidery of the tail and crest of the bird."
Textile_with_Coiled_Dragons,"This textile represents the tradition of northern China's Jin dynasty, which was known for textiles brocaded in gold with offset asymmetrical motifs on a solid-colored background. The motif here is a coiled dragon with a flaming jewel. The coiled dragon, as a pattern for princes' robes, dates from the Tang dynasty and was also used for garments in the Song and Xixia dynasties. This example is an early instance of a dragon with five claws. It is woven in a variant of the brocading technique first seen in a Jin-dynasty princely tomb of 1162."
Censer_with_figures_in_landscape,"The thickly potted censer stands on three small feet and is painted with a continuous landscape of mountains and rivers. Three scholars are shown boating on one side while another two stand on a promontory overlooking the view. Signs of habitation are also found in the pavilion nestled along the sides of the river, and the two small thatched huts on the river banks. The full moon in the sky and the flying geese add a seasonal element to the scene as do the budding trees. It seems likely that the painting, rendered in dramatic shades of light and dark cobalt, represents a moment in either autumn or spring. A four character inscription in cobalt blue in a round cartouche on the bottom reads dinghai nian zhi (丁亥年之), a cyclical date with corresponds with 1708. There are no missing pieces."
Panel_with_five_phoenixes_in_a_garden,"Large pictorial silk tapestries such as these were woven mostly in the imperial workshops in Suzhou, a textile center in southeast China. The background of bright yellow, a color exclusive to the emperor, further confirms the imperial origins. Though usually translated as “phoenix” in English, the fenghuang bird is a distinct mythical species with a different set of associations. The fenghuang, most noble of all feathered species, is said to appear only in times of peace and prosperity, so the creature is depicted frequently in works commissioned by imperial courts."
Daoist_Robe,"This dazzling garment would have been worn by Daoist priests during ceremonies. The back of the robe, which is displayed here, depicts five dragons hovering above a primordial landscape of stylized mountains rising from a frothy sea."
Brush_pot_with_decoration_of_landscape_and_poem_by_Du_Fu_(712–770),"The decoration on this brush pot is described as being in the “Master of the Rocks” style for the striking lines of cobalt used to add texture to the rocks and mountains. The poem reads:Clouds passing the sheer cliff spread embroidery and brocade,Sparse pines lining the waters play the reed pipes.—trans. after Stephen Owen"
Casting_Model_for_Belt_Plaque,"A primary beast-of-burden on the Silk Route, the camel plays a surprisingly minor role in the visual arts of Central Asia and China prior to the sixth century A.D. It seems likely that this plaque served as a model for the making of molds which in turn were sued to cast belt plaques or other adornments for people, horses, and chariots, favored by the Xiongnu and other Central Asian inhabitants."
Wall_hanging_with_scene_from_an_opera,"This wall hanging depicts a battle scene from an opera. A tangle of arms, legs, weapons, and costumes fills the visual space, bringing the drama of the battle to life, and the figures, enlarged to heroic scale, tower over the viewer. The textile makers used animal hair for the middle figure’s beard to add texture and three-dimensionality to the work. This banner might have hung on a stage to provide a background setting for an opera production, or perhaps it decorated another part of a theater."
Brush_holder_with_tribute_scene,"The lively figures carved on this brush pot represent a scene of tribute bearers, possibly from a country in Southeast Asia, traveling to China. The figure holding a scepter is leading the procession, which includes a peculiar two-wheeled cart laden with treasures, a lion, and an elephant with a precious plant."
Buddha_Shakyamuni_with_disciples,"Commissioned by the Qing imperial court, this stunning embroidery hanging features Tibetan-style Buddhist images. The large central Buddha sits on a lotus throne carried by lions, with his right hand in earth-touching mudra and his left in meditation mudra. The two small figures in front are the Buddha’s primary disciples: the youthful Ananda and the older Kashyapa. At the top, Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), the founder of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, is joined by two disciples. The uncommonly delicate embroidery successfully displays the solemnity of the Buddha and the piety of his disciples."
Theatrical_robe_with_flowers_and_butterflies,"Known as zhezi in Chinese opera, this robe follows the earlier Ming (1368–1644) style for leisure clothing. It has a Y-shaped collar and wide sleeves, and opens on the right side. A robe of this type with a white background was worn by performers playing the role of a young male, usually a playboy or a villain. One of the album pages displayed in this gallery shows an actor holding a jade horse in his right hand and wearing a similar robe. The accompanying inscription identifies him as the notorious “Colorful Butterfly” (Huahudie) from the play The Three Heroes and Five Gallants.On view during Rotation 1 of exhibition from June 25, 2016 through January 13, 2017."
Woman's_Informal_Summer_Robe,"The flowers and butterflies embroidered on this robe and on its sleeve and neck bands are an appropriate decoration for summer clothing, just as the lightweight gauze is a suitable fabric. The presence of a collar suggests that the garment is from the twentieth century. Not visible to us is a pocket made of the red gauze of the robe that was sewn to the body of the garment under the front overlap."
Jade_book,"This jade book is composed of pale green jade tablets engraved with an essay by the Qianlong emperor commemorating the completion of the Seven Buddhas Pagoda in the imperial garden. The text is carved in regular script calligraphy and filled with gold. Paired with the tablets are black paper pages, which bear the same text written in gold ink. This superb work not only exemplifies Emperor Qianlong’s particular fondness for jade and taste for lavish display but also reveals the Qing court’s partiality to Tibetan Buddhism over other contemporary religions."
Seal_casket_with_cover,"This casket once held the imperial seal. An animated dragon sits on top of its circular lid, on whose wall are the eight auspicious symbols of Tibetan Buddhism, including the wheel of law, conch shell, parasol, canopy, lotus flower, vase, paired fish, and knot of eternity. On the four sides of its square base are the twelve regal emblems, consisting of the sun, moon, constellation, mountain, dragon, pheasant, ritual vessels, water plant, flame, rice, axe, and diagram of polarity."
Textile_with_Floral_Pattern,"Central Asian silks with small dense patterns in gold were part of the international trade that flourished under the Mongols, and most known examples survive in European church treasuries. This piece was part of a liturgical vestment long associated with Pope Benedict XI (d. 1304). Textiles such as these were also depicted in Italian—particularly Sienese—paintings, for example Simone Martini's Annunciation of 1333."
Jar_(Guan),"Large and small two-handled jars, pitchers, bowls, and beakers are the most common forms produced in the Machang phase of the Majiayao (or Gansu Yangshao) culture. Decorative motifs on Machang-period wares are largely geometric and include curvilinear patterns and cross-hatching, and lozenges, triangles, circles, and squares in an endless array of combinations. The zoomorphic figure in the center of this jar is one of the more distinctive images in the Machang vocabulary. Four limbs, bent in the center, are attached to a long torso, capped by a small head. Feathers or some other type of tufting are found at the end of the upper limbs and at the joints of all four appendages. These enigmatic motifs are variously interpreted: they are sometimes explained as abstract representations of natural creatures such as frogs; other hypotheses suggest that they are symbolic of either the costume worn by a shaman or the transformation he undergoes during rituals."
Armored_Cavalryman,"This figure has been assembled based on photographs taken in the 1930s and 1940s in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa during the Great Prayer Festival. The photographs showed troops of ceremonial armored cavalry, who wore a standardized set of equipment as stipulated by the central government of Tibet probably from the mid-seventeenth or eighteenth century onward. The equipment included a helmet, a mail shirt, a set of four mirrors, an armored belt, a bow case and quiver, a matchlock musket, a bandoleer with gunpowder and bullets, and a short spear for the rider, as well as a saddle, saddle rug, and tack for the horse. Armed and equipped in a similar fashion, Tibetan government officials were periodically required to demonstrate proficiency on horseback with musket, bow and arrow, and spear until as late as the mid twentieth century."
Armored_Cavalryman,"This figure has been assembled based on photographs taken in the 1930s and 1940s, in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa during the Great Prayer Festival. Part of the festival included troops of ceremonial armored cavalry, who wore a standardized set of equipment as stipulated by the central government of Tibet from about the mid-seventeenth or eighteenth century onward. This included a helmet, shirt of mail, set of four mirrors, armored belt, bow case and quiver, matchlock musket, bandoleer with gunpowder and bullets, and short spear for the rider, as well as a saddle, saddle rug, and tack for the horse. Armed and equipped in a similar fashion, Tibetan goverment officials periodically were required to demonstrate proficiency on horseback with musket, bow and arrow, and spear until as late as the mid-twentieth century."
Rondel_with_a_Seated_Buddha,"These Buddhas with halos and body mandorlas were part of an elaborate halo that embellished a large standing devotional icon. Little remains of the original polychrome, but it is evident that the bodies were painted red and the faces were white."
Dish,The shape of this three-legged dish can be found in Tang-dynasty silver. Its formal rosette medallion containing six palmette forms could well be derived from similar motifs found on Central Asian metalwork and textiles.
Theatrical_robe_with_dragons,"Robes decorated with dragons (mangpao) were worn by performers in roles such as king, chancellor, general, and high-ranking lady. This fine example is made of a high-quality brocade also used for dragon robes that functioned as official uniforms. The five-clawed dragon, a symbol of the emperor, further indicates that it was made for the imperial theater.On view during Rotation 1 of exhibition from June 25, 2016 through January 13, 2017."
Theatrical_warrior’s_robe,"Elaborately decorated robes such as this one were often used for military roles. While the metallic thread creates a striking impression, the finished product’s weight would have limited the performer’s range of motion.On view during Rotation 1 of exhibition from June 25, 2016 through January 13, 2017."
View_of_a_Garden_Villa,"Yuan Jiang was assisted in his work by a number of other artists, including his nephew Yuan Yao, who continued to practice the family style into the late eighteenth century.This handscroll, which is a close copy of Yuan Jiang's original composition, now in the Tianjin Municipal History Museum, records in detail the appearance of the Zhanyuan, or ""Gazing Garden,"" of Nanjing, which was part of the estate of a Manchu official; thus, it preserves a valuable record of an otherwise lost garden of the early eighteenth century."
Theatrical_jacket_with_dragons,"This impressive ensemble (with 30.76.19) features a striking dragon on the front and large triangle-shaped sleeves. Garments of this sort are often characterized as arhat robes (luohanyi) that would have been worn to play monks in dramas based on Buddhist history. However, no direct evidence confirms this theory. The numerous robes of this type preserved in the Forbidden City in Beijing (and elsewhere) and their varied decoration suggest that this form of dress was used by multiple kinds of actors in large-scale court performances.On view during Rotation 1 of exhibition from June 25, 2016 through January 13, 2017."

Calligraphy_of_a_Chinese_Poem,"?baku Dokuryü was a noted calligrapher and poet in his native China before he emigrated to Japan in 1653 to join the ?baku Zen temple Mampuki-ji, near Kyoto, Japan. His elegant and flowing calligraphy style strongly influenced his Japanese literati contemporaries."
Headdress_for_a_Manchu_Chinese_Woman,"The delicate metal ornaments on this headdress, designed to move with every step, are decorated with bright blue feathers from kingfishers, small birds prized for their iridescent plumage. The bamboo, lingzhi fungus, and rocks depicted symbolize longevity, while the bats convey wishes of happiness."
Sofa,"The great-grandfather of the donor of this sofa reputedly had it made in China and brought it to Philadelphia in his own ship. The Chinese craftsmen based its design on a contemporary English model of an upholstered sofa, likely working from an illustration in one of the numerous design or manufacturing books that were circulated in the period."
Stand,"The decoration on this stand, known as the ""Quaker Farmer"" pattern, is according to Morris family history based on a drawing made by Mary Hollingsworth Morris (1776-1820).  Mary was married to Israel Morris, the tenth child of ""Captain"" Samuel Morris, a prominent Philadelphian active in the China Trade.  The claim is supported by a notation on the reverse of the drawing that reads, ""The China in Table & Tea Sets was recd Executed calld the Cow China.  Pattern for Set of China copied by Mary H. Morris Jan. 7. 1797."""
Tea_Table_with_Figures_in_a_Chinese_Formal_Garden,"<P></P>Highly refined lacquer furniture—generally in the form of chests or cabinets made in China and Japan for their domestic markets—was available, in limited quantities, in Europe from as early as the mid-seventeenth century. These costly and cherished objects were found in many of Europe’s most prestigious households, where they were often raised on stands with elaborate gilded or japanned (the European version of lacquer) decoration. 

<P></P>By the early nineteenth century, the fashion for Asian lacquerware had reached the middle classes in Europe and the United States. In response, Asian craftsmen began to manufacture Western-style lacquer furniture such as this example. This table was made for Philadelphian John A. Lewis while he was in China. Lewis’s father was in the China trade and when he died, John and his brother took over the business, which was located at the southeast corner of Walnut and Front Streets in Philadelphia."
Plate,"This plate was made in China, for export to the Islamic market. It is part of an elaborate dessert set made for Azim Jah, a descendent in the Wallajah family and the Nawab of Arcot (ruled 1819 to 1825). The pink pattern is a Chinese copy of a design found on English porcelain."
Platter,"This platter was made for the Grill family, whose heraldic device was the stork."
Saucer,"This dish is decorated with Arabic numerals and Qur'anic inscriptions that were thought to have powerful healing properties. The numbers in the center should add up to the same sum in any direction. Porcelain of this type was popular in India and southeast Asia. This piece was purchased in Madras, India."
Inkstone_in_the_Form_of_a_Chinese_Zither_(Qin),"The qin is a Chinese-style zither, which was considered the favorite musical instrument of the literati, who would often bring one along to poetic gatherings. By fashioning this inkstone, used for writing calligraphy, in this particular shape the artist emphasized the sophistication of the future owner."
Plate,"The scene on this plate, emblematic of Earth, derives from a series of popular prints depicting the four elements of earth, air, fire and water. The prints are themselves based on paintings by Francesco Albani (Italian, 1578–1660). The lion-drawn chariot carries Roman deities related to the earth: goddesses Ceres (agriculture), Cybele (nature and fertility), and Flora (flowers), and the god Bacchus (wine)."
Plate,"The image on this plate, depicting Neptune, Roman god of the sea, is taken from an engraving by Frederick Bloemaert (Dutch, c. 1616-1690) after a drawing by his father, Abraham Bloemaert (1566-1651)."
Sutra_Cover,"<P></P>Buddhist scriptures, or sutras, that are bound accordion-style are often protected with covers composed of paperboard wrapped in decorative silk. Titles and volume numbers appear on strips of paper adhered to the fabric. The use of silk for sutra covers dates back to at least the Tang dynasty (618–907), but most extant examples are from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and later, when the printing industry grew in China. In some cases, sutra printings were sponsored by the imperial government, resulting in superior editions based on texts from the palace collection.

<P></P>Complex weaves of lustrous silk, sometimes highlighted by metallic thread, made possible a wide array of patterns and motifs. These include floral scrolls, Buddhist emblems, traditional Chinese symbols of blessings, and Chinese characters with auspicious meanings, all of which are also found on Buddhist ritual vessels and implements made from lacquer, gold, silver, and porcelain. 

<P></P>In 1940 more than five hundred sutra covers, along with a significant assemblage of other textiles, were acquired from Carl Schuster, who served as assistant curator of Chinese art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1935 to 1937. Schuster’s collection is an important resource for the study of Chinese textiles."

Plate,"Part of a dinner service, this plate bears the coat of arms of Anders Bachmansson (1697–1772), who was ennobled under the name Nordencrantz in 1743. Bachmansson was a trade councilor and factory owner. Decorative elements in the border—rods, anvils, waterwheels, and furnaces—make reference to his profession; the shell and bees are taken from his coat of arms; and the bear is from his crest."
Bowl,"This bowl was made in China, for export to the Islamic market.  It is an example of ""clobbered ware,"" in which preexisting decorations are painted over with new designs. On this piece, a version of the ""blossom and nightingale"" motif popular in the Persian market is covered with an Urdu inscription honoring a noble woman in her ""fourth age."" Enamelers sometimes clobbered porcelain so that they could quickly fill special orders."
Basket,"The coat of arms are those of the Brewer or Bruer family of Great Marlow, England."
Plate,"This scene of the Resurrection of Christ was taken from an illustration in <i>A Written and Visual History, Images of the Old and New Testaments (De Schriftuurlyke Geschiedenissen en Gelykenissen, Van het Oude en Nieuwe Verbond)</i>, a book of engravings by Dutch artist Jan Luyken (1649-1712)."
Plate,"This plate is decorated with a scene of a fortune-teller. The subject, a popular one in the eighteenth century, also appears on European porcelains."
Plate,"This plate was made in China, for export to the European market. The scene in the center shows the Resurrection of Christ, and was taken from an engraving by Dutch artist Jan Luyken (1649–1712). The engraving, along with others by Luyken, was also used to illustrate several editions of the Bible, including one printed in 1734."
Plate,"This plate is painted with a portrait of Martin Luther, the founder of Protestantism, above a depiction of Christ and the disciples—images that derive from an engraving by Franz Brun (German, active c. 1559 to 1596). Brun’s engraving appears on the title page of a Bible published in Amsterdam in 1648 and in a 1734 Bible that includes illustrations by Dutch artist Jan Luyken (1649–1712), whose engravings were also often used as a source for decoration on Chinese export wares."
Soup_Plate,"This soup plate, part of a larger service, bears the coat of arms of Chadwick quartering Malvesyn and is inscribed on the reverse with the words ""Canton in China 24th Jan'y 1791."" Although dates appear occasionally on armorial porcelain, this is the only known Chinese service dated in this manner."
Plate,"The scene depicted on this plate, taken from an unidentified engraving, may depict the Greek mythology story of the rescue of Andromeda by Perseus. Cepheus, the king of Ethiopia, was forced to sacrifice his beautiful daughter, Andromeda, to a sea monster sent by Poseidon. Perseus, the son of Zeus, had fallen in love with Andromeda and won her hand in marriage by slaying the monster."
Plate,"The Crucifixion scene shown here may have been based on an engraving by Jacques de Gheyn II (Dutch, 1565-1629) after a work by his contemporary Zacharias Dolendo. Gheyn's work was one of a number of engravings of this subject available in the eighteenth century."
Plate,"This plate was made in China, for export to the European market. This scene shows the Resurrection of Christ, and was taken from an illustration in <i>De Schriftuurlyke Geschiedenissen en Gelykenissen, Van het Oude en Nieuwe Verbond</i> (<i>A Written and Visual History, Images of the Old and New Testaments</i>), a book of engravings by Dutch artist Jan Luyken (1649-1712)."
Coffeepot,"Early in the Dutch East India Company’s trade with China, the company ordered porcelains that, first in their shape and then somewhat later in their decoration, catered specifically to a European clientele. This octagonal coffeepot represents one of the earliest examples of the practice, its form and decoration based on European models."
Cup_showing_the_Penn_Family_Coat_of_Arms,"<P>Owned by the Penn family of Pennsylvania</P>

<P>This cup bears the abbreviated Penn family crest as used by Thomas Penn and John Penn, William Penn's son and grandson.</P>"
Dish,"This plate is decorated with an image of Juno, the principal goddess of the Roman pantheon, and her symbol, the peacock. The subject was a popular one on Chinese porcelain intended for export, but the print source has not been identified."
Platter,"This platter was originally part of a large and important dinner service made to order in China for Gijsbert Jan Feith (1719–1775). Feith was born in the Netherlands but lived most of his life in the East Indies. He rose to some prominence in Batavia (modern Jakarta), the capital of the East Indies and the principal harbor for Dutch ships sailing to and from Europe, and likely ordered the service in 1763, the year in which he was appointed alderman of Batavia. Feith must have had an interest in family heraldry as he commissioned decoration that is unique for export porcelain: in addition to his own coat of arms, he included the arms and family names of his father, mother (van Hardenbroek), and her parents (Cock and Merlot)."
Tea_Caddy,"The unusual decoration on this tea caddy, musicians in Near Eastern costume, may have been created by the Dutch painter and draftsman Cornelis Pronk. The Dutch East India Company - the largest of the European trading companies operating in Asia - hired Pronk in 1734 to provide designs for porcelain produced in China for the European market."
Beaker,"While the decoration on this beaker, known in Europe as <i>famille verte</i> (green family), is based on that of Chinese porcelain of the Kangxi period (1662–1722), its shape is modeled on a European drinking vessel, perhaps one in glass that was shipped to China by European traders for the purpose of being copied in porcelain."
Plate,"This plate was made in China, for export to the English market. The designs in the cartouches on the rim represent the four continents. The figure of Hope in the center supports a shield that bears the Ker family coat of arms. Jane, daughter of Ellis Martin and Elizabeth Ker, married her first cousin, William Ker, about 1790, and this plate is likely from the service made to commemorate their marriage."
Plate,"The scene of the Resurrection of Christ shown on this plate was taken from an engraving by Dutch artist Jan Luyken (1649–1712). The engraving, along with others by Luyken, was used to illustrate several editions of the Bible, including one printed in 1734."

"Plate,_Showing_the_Philadelphia_Waterworks","As the first municipal water system in the United States, the Fairmount Waterworks attracted many visitors to Philadelphia in the early nineteenth century. Located on the banks of the Schuylkill River at the foot of Fairmount Park, the waterworks were depicted by numerous American and European artists and subsequently appeared on Chinese export porcelain, as seen on this plate."
Spoon,Spoons of this type were used by elite Muslims in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century for serving food.
Teapot,"The scene on this teapot appears to be Venus in her chariot in the clouds. She is attended by Cupid, who shoots an arrow at a resting figure who could perhaps be Telemachus, son of Ulysses, upon whom Venus had designs."
Tea_Caddy,"The unusual decoration on this tea caddy, musicians in Near Eastern costume, may have been created by the Dutch painter and draftsman Cornelis Pronk. The Dutch East India Company - the largest of the European trading companies operating in Asia - hired Pronk in 1734 to provide designs for porcelain produced in China for the European market."
Plate,"This plate is from a series of six known as the ""Great Scene of Folly"" and may have been intended to caution Dutch investors against disastrous financial schemes. Translated from the Dutch, the inscription reads, ""By God, lost all my shares."""
Teapot,"The scene on this teapot is from an unidentified engraving after the painting <i>Aqua</i> by Jacopo Amigoni (Italian, 1682-1752)."
Plate,"This plate is from a series of six known as the ""Great Scene of Folly"" and may have been intended to caution Dutch investors against disastrous financial schemes. Translated from the Dutch, the inscription reads, ""Who Wants to Speculate on Utrecht or New Amsterdam."""
Beaker,"While the decoration on this beaker, known in Europe as <i>famille verte</i> (green family), is based on that of Chinese porcelain of the Kangxi period (1662–1722), its shape is modeled on a European drinking vessel, perhaps one in glass that was shipped to China by European traders for the purpose of being copied in porcelain."
Platter,"This platter is from one of three services made within a decade of one another. All three bear the coat of arms, incorrectly painted, of a branch of the Oliphant family of Scotland."
"Bowl_-_Scenes_from_Various_Chinese_Stories,_including_Saga_of_Chu_and_Han","The image in the center panel of this bowl derives from the Saga of Chu and Han. Zhang Liang, a loyal retainer of Liu Bang, the first emperor of the Han dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 220), picks up a shoe for a Daoist Immortal disguised as an old man. Zhang was later rewarded with a secret military book for this good deed."
Jar_with_Lid,"This gilded silver jar is part of the paraphernalia used for betel chewing. The generic term “betel nut” is technically a misnomer. What betel chewers put in their mouths is primarily areca nut, sometimes wrapped in betel leaf, with mineral lime usually added as a catalyst."

Figure_on_a_Lion,"This piece was produced at the Sawankhalok kilns in Thailand. It takes the unusual form of a Chinese man seated on a fu dog (also known as a Chinese lion or the “Lion of Buddha”), a mythical creature thought to ward off evil. This Chinese subject was rarely depicted in Thailand."
Covered_Vase,"This vase, inspired in form by an ancient bronze, is unusual in that it has both Arabic and Chinese inscriptions. The Chinese phrase for “life everlasting” appears in a cartouche on either side of the Arabic inscription that pays tribute to the power of Allah. On the lip is the Chinese word <i>Yudetang</i>, which translates to “Hall of Bathing in Virtue.” Legend has it that the hall—located in the Forbidden City—was a Turkish-style bath built for the Qianlong emperor’s favorite Uighur concubine, who was captured when Chinese troops defeated her people as part of the empire’s plan to expand Qing territory. The Uighurs are a Muslim ethnic group located in the northwest part of China in today’s Xinjiang province, which explains the combination of Arabic and Chinese on this piece."
White_Hawk,"In 1714 Giuseppe Castiglione, a native Italian, trained artist, and Jesuit missionary, was sent to China. The following year he was presented to the Kangxi emperor. Castiglione adopted the Chinese name Lang Shih-ning and served as an artist at the Qing court from 1715 until his death in 1766. He adapted his paintings to court tastes by combining Western and Chinese techniques, often working in close collaboration with Chinese painters."
Teabowl,The styles of Chinese Jian ware (called temmoku in Japan) were widely copied in many Japanese tea utensils.
Tray,<i>Tixi</i> is a technique in which multiple layers of different-colored lacquers are carved at an angle to create a decorative striated effect.
Vase,"This vase was purchased from the display of merchant banker and collector of ancient Chinese art Hu Kwang Yung at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876. Hu's exhibit received three awards for its porcelains, plain silks, cloisonnés, and bronzes."
Jar,This jar was purchased from Hu Kwang Yung's exhibit at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876.
Dish,"This dish, one of a pair, is inscribed with a poem composed by the Qianlong emperor (ruled 1736 to 1795). The poem is written in elegant standard script calligraphy."
Vase,"The flowering plum is one of the most beloved and enduring images in Chinese art, in part because it is among the first plants to bloom each spring. As a sixth-century poet noted, ""She alone has the gift of recognizing spring."" From the twelfth century on, an entire genre of painting was devoted to aspects of the flowering plum. On this spectacular vase, the artist has given us one interpretation: a night view with the tree set against the dark, black sky. The delicate blossoms contrast with the gnarled, aged trunk of the tree as both wrap around the contours of the perfectly formed vase."
Bottle,The characters translate: peace under heaven.
Vase,The four characters translate: red flowers fill the courtyard.
Vase,"This vase is one of a pair created in imitation of Song dynasty ""Lung-ch'üan"" ware."
Vase,"Jade was a favored material of the Qianlong emperor. During his reign from 1736 to 1795, novel and intricate designs that demonstrated jade craftsmen’s skill became especially popular. Linked chains such as the one seen here, which attaches the cover of the vase, illustrate their bravado workmanship."
Pillow,This rare Jun ware pillow is covered in a green glaze rather than the usual opaque blue glaze associated with the Jun kiln.
Charger,"The designs on this piece differ from most late-eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Chinese porcelain made for export to India. Instead of showing motifs popular among Europeans (and favored by Indian Muslims), it depicts Chinese auspicious symbols that include lotuses, peaches, and pomegranates, and has cartouches in the ruyi (""according to [your] will"") shape--all of which are meant to wish the owner longevity and good fortune. The Chinese enamelers who copied Arabic script for their customers often misplaced dots and characters, making the Urdu inscriptions difficult to decipher, as on this plate."
"Pillow_with_Confucian_Scholar,_Buddhist_Monk,_and_Daoist_Priest","This remarkable design is unique among known examples of Cizhou pillows. Even before the tenth century, the great belief systems of Chinese civilization, Confusianism, Buddhism, and Daoism— represented here by these figures playing Chinese chess—were viewed as mutually complementary and inextricably linked to the same goal. The so-called Three Teachings was a popular theme in tenth- to thirteenth-century paintings."
Kettle_with_Lid,The scene on this kettle depicts eight Daoist immortals in a Chinese landscape.
Scholar's_Rock,"<P>Rocks with extraordinary forms have been appreciated for their aesthetic merit by Chinese scholars for more than one thousand years. Traditionally, scholar's rocks were displayed in the intimate setting of the scholar's studio.  They are often mounted on finely fitted and carved wooden stands and placed in a spot where the scholar can gaze upon their form in quiet contemplation. </P>

<P>This majestic rock evokes the qualities of a monumental precipice in a mountainous Chinese landscape. Charcoal gray and streaked with white, the rock is especially striking when seen from the front and sides, which are covered with deep and long columnar shafts and deep, vertical furrows. The comparatively smooth back allows for a less obstructed view of two wonderful c-shaped hollows at the side of the rock. A large example such as this one might be placed directly on the floor, where it would evoke imagery of a mountainous landscape or one of the Isles of the Immortals. The wooden stand has a pleasing, undulating surface that is characteristic of 19th century stands.</P>

<P>This rock lets out a bell-like ring when struck, a quality that is highly prized by collectors.</P>"
Covered_Bowl,"The Eight Immortals (He Xiangu, Cao Guojiu, Li Tieguai, Lan Caihe, Lu Dongbin, Han Xiang Zi, Zhang Guo Lao, Zhongli Quan) are painted on the exteriors of this bowl and lid, and the God of Longevity is depicted on the bowl's interior. The association between the Immortals and the God of Longevity first arose during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) when Zhu Youdun (1379-1439) wrote the drama A Group of Immortals Celebrate Longevity at the Pan Dao Peach Festival."
Compound_Wardrobe,"<p>During the Qing dynasty the depiction of this particular type of dragon—with five claws—was restricted to imperial items. Add in the furniture’s impressive size and the sumptuousness of the gold decoration and it is clear this wardrobe once belonged to a high-ranking Chinese official or nobleman. It would have been placed both in the private areas of residences and in public spaces like a reception hall.</p>

<p>The bottom sections stored silk garments while those at the top, accessed by a ladder, held smaller items such as hats.</p>"
Chess_Pieces,"Chinese craftsmen were particularly skilled at carving concentric balls—a small ball contained within a larger one—like those fashioned for these chess pieces. While European craftsmen had been carving concentric balls since around 1500, by the nineteenth century the practice had become associated with China in the minds of many Westerners who, enchanted by the complex and delicate carving of Chinese artists, imported such works from Canton (now Guangzhou), where they were specially produced for the Western market."
Game_Box,"This box belonged to Benjamin C. Warner; his initials, B. W., appear on the lid. It is known that Warner witnessed the will of Nathan Dunn (1782-1844), a Philadelphia merchant involved in the China trade, and it was probably Dunn who imported this box."
Cup_Stand,The silver base is a later addition.
Water_Pot,This water pot along with accompanying writing implements were displayed at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876.
Sutra_Cover,"<P></P>Buddhist scriptures, or sutras, that are bound accordion-style are often protected with covers composed of paperboard wrapped in decorative silk. Titles and volume numbers appear on strips of paper adhered to the fabric. The use of silk for sutra covers dates back to at least the Tang dynasty (618–907), but most extant examples are from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and later, when the printing industry grew in China. In some cases, sutra printings were sponsored by the imperial government, resulting in superior editions based on texts from the palace collection.

<P></P>Complex weaves of lustrous silk, sometimes highlighted by metallic thread, made possible a wide array of patterns and motifs. These include floral scrolls, Buddhist emblems, traditional Chinese symbols of blessings, and Chinese characters with auspicious meanings, all of which are also found on Buddhist ritual vessels and implements made from lacquer, gold, silver, and porcelain. 

<P></P>In 1940 more than five hundred sutra covers, along with a significant assemblage of other textiles, were acquired from Carl Schuster, who served as assistant curator of Chinese art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1935 to 1937. Schuster’s collection is an important resource for the study of Chinese textiles."

Standing_Warrior,"During the Tang dynasty, a pair of warriors was often placed with a corresponding pair of guardian beasts near the entry of important tombs. Fully clad in colorful armor representative of what was worn by real soldiers at the time, this figure (and its pair, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2005-92-6) stands on a low platform with a solemn expression. His left hand is clenched in a position that indicates it once held a weapon, while the right hand rests on arectangular shield supported by his right foot. This warrior sports the so-called “bright and shining armor,” which is characterized by the two gilded metal ovals on the front of his chest."

As enlightened monks who have escaped the cycle of birth and rebirth, they protect the Buddhist faith and its teachings. In China, sculptures of luohan have been popular from the 1100s onwards. They were placed in Buddhist halls in groups of sixteen or eighteen, lining both sides of the room and flanking the central altar."

Incense_Burner,"<P></P>Inscribed on the base (translated): I wonder if someone replaced the incense from last night. Surprisingly, the fragrance can still be smelled until now. The design (of the handles) was taken from the chong fish, and the color is like that of a patterned eel. There is no fire or smoke to begin with, but it seems like there is cloud and mist. After I finished distinguishing the eight transformations and discerning the true nature, how can I tell where the roots of my nose are?

<P></P>Composed by the Qianlong emperor in the mid-spring of the cyclical year of Bingshen (AD 1776)

<P></P>This incense burner demonstrates China’s deep reverence of its past. Most likely made during the Ming dynasty, its form is based on a thirteenth- to fourteenth-century Ge ware censer, which itself was modeled after an archaic bronze food offering vessel. The Qianlong emperor (ruled 1736–95) of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) admired these historical aspects and had his sentiments carved into the base."

Beaker_Vase_(one_of__a_pair),The unusual shape of this vase combines the classical Chinese bronze beaker form with that of the double gourd.
Jar_and_Cover,Chinese porcelain pieces such as this one - characterized by a simple but refined shape and a pale green glaze - came to be known in the West as “celadon.”
Vase_with_Handles,"The main band of blue glaze on this vase contains two scenes in the style of seventeenth-century Chinese orthodox ink painters. An example of Qianlong period technological bravura, the vase startlingly combines the conservative style of scholar-official painting with extravagant glazes and ornament."
Twelve-Panel_Screen,"The ladies in these palace scenes are engaged in pursuits such as looking at antiquities, enjoying plum blossoms in winter, gazing at the moon during the Moon Festival, reading books, dressing hair in the fall, sipping cool soup in the summer, drinking tea, and raising birds and rabbits. Both end panels feature the ""Hundred Antiquities,"" a decorative motif that includes archaic bronzes and other objects popular for a Chinese scholar's study. The feminine scenes and the auspicious creatures with their young on the lower portions of the panels all suggest that this screen was intended for a woman's quarters."

Bowl_with_Lid,"The delicate gold designs of floral motifs (perhaps peonies or lotus) closely resemble Chinese taste, while the bolder designs along the rims reflect the taste of the intended market, Thailand."
Bowl_with_Lid,"The very elaborate design seen on this bowl, perhaps inspired by textiles, was produced with a technique called lai nam thong, or “gold wash.” Such works require as many as three firings in the kiln: one for the plain glaze, one after the enamel colors have been painted onto the surface, and a third firing at a lower temperature after the gold has been applied."
Bowl_with_Lid,"This bowl was produced with a technique called lai nam thong, or “gold wash,” in which the artist outlines the enamel decoration with liquid bright gold. The cartouches alternately show heavenly beings called norasingh, which are half-man and half-lion, and theppanom, which are reverential figures."
Flower-Shaped_Cup,"This elegant, six-lobed cup is made from nephrite jade, a material venerated in China for its ritual significance, association with gentlemanly virtures, and physical properties, holding a place equivalent to that of gold in the West. Connoisseurs of the time appreciated this understated material and celebrated the purity of the form and texture of the stone, here emphasized by the absence of decoration in this cup."
Wall_Hanging-Chrysanthemum,"Each panel in the set represents a season: the peony for spring, the lotus for summer, the chrysanthemum for autumn, and the plum blossom for winter."
Wine_Jar_(Guan),"Similar to cloisonné enamel wares, in which raised wires (<i>cloisons</i>) are used to fuse enamels onto a metal body, in <i>fahua</i> wares lines of raised liquid clay, called slip, are used to create a design on a ceramic body. The design is then filled in with a variety of colored glazes including dark blue, turquoise, purple, yellow, green, and cream. Produced from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, <i>fahua</i> appears on roof tiles and garden seats as well as on large vessels such as storage jars, vases, and incense burners."
Monks_Cap_Ewer,"This Tibetan-style ewer is shaped after a pot for butter tea. Butter tea is a Tibetan specialty, made from salted black tea and yak butter. The ingredients are combined with boiling water in a ""tea churn"" and vigorously mixed. The resulting liquid, which resembles broth, is served in a vessel shaped like this one. Tibetan-inspired vessels are among the exotic foreign shapes that were produced in porcelain in China during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries."
Bird_Cage_Hook,"Official script characters ornament the four sides of the hook and the upper left-hand corner of the base of this delicately designed functional object. Both text and image refer to the <i>Three Kingdoms</i> epic, which features three famous second-century A.D. friends who swore an oath to fight side by side and live and die together. The illustration shows one of them, Kuan Yü, faithfully guarding the two wives of another, Liu Pie."
Inscription,"The stone carvings collectively known as the Wu Family shrines are a series of organized pictorial elements and inscriptions forming a tomb discovered in China's Shandong province in 1786.  The stone reliefs however have been studied since the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279) through ink rubbings of their surface decoration and inscriptions.  These rubbings were created by placing paper over the surface of the stone and rubbing the paper with ink, transferring the stone texture to paper.  They are a commonly referenced historical source for the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), but they often only selectively represent the stone surface and were in some cases likely altered to depict the ""original"" stone, eroding their reliability.  Scholars now interpret the rubbings both as representations of the stone carving and pictorial traditions of the Han dynasty in which the stones were created, and also as a revealing look at attitudes towards the study of antiquity in the Song dynasty (and later years) in which the rubbings entered the study of history."

Clothes_Cupboard_(Gui),"The inlaid design, known as ""the hundred antiquities"" (baigu), represents objects a Chinese scholar would collect and display in his study."
Reception_Hall,"This painted chamber, built in the early 1600s, was once the main reception hall in a palatial compound in the Chinese capital city of Beijing. Wang Cheng-en, a eunuch in the service of the last Ming dynasty ruler, built the compound, and it later came to be known by the name of a subsequent owner, Duke Zhao.  

<P>The palatial residence, like a traditional family compound, was built on a rectangular plan, facing south, and surrounded by a wall. The reception hall, the most formal of the many buildings, would have been located on the central axis, not far from the south gate. Here, Wang Cheng-en would have received guests and petitioners. The white plaster and brick walls and tile floor are modern replacements, but the rest is original, from the marble bases of the great lacquered wooden columns to the peak of the roof.</P>

<P>As in all East Asian buildings, in contrast to Western architecture, the structure of the roof is greatly emphasized. All of the supporting members of the immensely heavy tile roof have been left exposed, and are accentuated by surface decoration. Although some of the brilliantly painted decoration has been lost, the effect is still one of dignified beauty. The hall is furnished with lacquer storage chests, a dog cage, porcelains, jades, and imperial jewelry. The Crozier Collection of rock crystal, formerly part of the Chinese Imperial Collection, is also displayed here in cases.</P>"

Saucer_-_Three_Star_Gods,"In the East Asian cosmology, it was believed that Good Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity were ensured by Three Stars: Fu star (the planet Jupiter), Lu star (the First star of the Big Dipper), and Shou star (Canopus, the brightest star in the southern constellation of Carina), respectively. The Three Stars are usually shown in their personified images as Daoist Immortals. They often became subjects for paintings and ceramic decoration, as seen in this piece, expressing a wish for a good life."
Snuff_Bottle,"The high relief designs on this bottle portray the <i>Legend of the White Snake</i>, a celebrated story passed down for centuries before appearing in printed forms and popular dramas in the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Sitting at the front of the canopied boat is the protagonist, a transformative being who has been rescued from the internment of an evil monk. On the other side of the bottle, Buddhist and Daoist deities watch from colorful clouds, delighting in and approving of the righteous White Snake’s freedom."

Snuff_Dish,"In China, fishing along rivers and streams has long been regarded a gentlemanly activity that suits the reclusive quality of the literati (learned men). This old, solitary fisherman sitting under a landscape of lofty pine trees is intended to embody the idea of a sage who has achieved oneness with nature."
Piece_from_Woman's_Headdress,"This decorative plaque, possibly once part of a headdress, is imbued with good wishes for long life: the god of longevity, Shoulao, identified by his large forehead and long flowing beard, is preceded in the foreground by a deer, a crane, bamboo, and a lingzhi fungus, all symbols of longevity."
Head_of_a_Bodhisattva,"Hollow, cast-iron figures of bodhisattvas that stand more than five feet high have been found in a Buddhist nunnery and several other locations in Henan province. This head was originally part of one such figure. Rectangular holes once used to hold in place an elaborate crown are visible at the base of the protuberance (ushnisa) at the top of the bodhisattva's head."
Tomb_Guardian,"The achievement of early Chinese ceramics is well exemplified by funerary sculptures from the Tang dynasty, when the cosmopolitan empire enjoyed cultural florescence and technological advancement. The imaginative design of this fantastic creature, with its spread wings, protruding manes, and a fearsome dragon head with horns and flames, make it one of the most recognizable guardian figures of the era. It is further enlivened with the celebrated sancai glaze, which incorporates the colors of green, brown, and cream into mesmerizing patterns."

Butter_Lamp,"Although clearly made in China, this pair of butter lamps may have been used by Chinese, Manchu, Mongol, or Tibetan practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism."
Vase_(one_of_a_pair),"This vase, one of a pair, is decorated with an idyllic garden scene: pheasants perch on rocks amid flowering peonies and magnolias, while blue jays cavort in the branches above. Along the shoulder are the symbols of the ""Four Accomplishments"" of the Chinese scholar: a pair of scrolls (painting), bound books (calligraphy), a wrapped qin or lute (music), and a game board and pieces (playing xiangqi, a type of Chinese chess game). The auspicious bees, butterflies, and floral sprays at the neck of the vase complete the picture of an ideal scholar's world."
Sparrows_and_Millet,Small-scale album leaves and round fans with motifs of birds and flowers were introduced to Japan from China and flourished during the Muromachi period (1392–1573). Works like this one were highly regarded in Japan.
Assembled_Blessings,"The ""assembled blessings"" depicted include such auspicious omens as lotus pods with joined stems and double millet heads, which represent symbols of fertility and abundance."
Dish,"The assortment of flowers in a woven basket and the bowl of fruit on this dish are visual puns expressing auspicious wishes, including wealth and prosperity (peony flower) and blessings and longevity (Buddha’s Hand citron fruit). Popular in the eighteenth century, such depictions were found not only on porcelains but also on other decorative arts. During this period the transfer of imagery across different mediums was facilitated by the increase in commercial woodblock printing in South China."
Dish_(one_of_a_pair),"This eggshell porcelain dish is decorated in a range of pastel shades of overglaze enamels popular in China in the early eighteenth century. The combination of the rooster and peony blossoms is a rebus (a visual riddle in which the items pictured have names that sound like a word or phrase) conveying wishes for receiving official rank and honor, or for wealth, rank, and good fortune."
Lady_beneath_Tall_Bamboo,"The image of the solitary lady is drawn from the final couplet of the poem ""Jiaren"" (Fair Lady), composed by the celebrated Tang poet Du Fu (712–770): ""The weather is cold, her azure sleeves are thin, At twilight she rests by tall bamboo."" The pale ink washes that make up the background of this painting indicate the approach of dusk, and the four tall, thin bamboo branches connecting the upper and lower edges of the painting provide the rest of the poem’s setting. In between a pierced Taihu rock and the tall bamboo is a plum tree with a profusion of white blossoms. Together with the camellias at the lower right, they indicate that the cold winter night is coming. The grouping of plum blossom, bamboo, and rock is called the Three Purities (<i>san qing</i>), echoing the character of the lady who is the embodiment of surpassing beauty."
Stool,"<p>This six-sided stool is made out of a precious hardwood—called <i>zitan</i> in China—used primarily for furniture gracing Qing dynasty palaces. This example convey auspicious messages through the fruits and flowers held by the pairs of young boys on each side. </p>

<p>Auspicious Decoration: Flower and Fruits</p> 

<p>Flower: lotus for harmony. Fruits: pomegranate and lychee for many sons, Buddha’s Hand and peach for longevity, and persimmon for a successful career.</p>

<p>Overall, the design functions as a rebus (a visual riddle) offering wishes for many happy, wealthy, and long-lived children.</p>"
Faceted_Vase_with_Morning_Glories,"The unusual faceted form of this vase derives from an Islamic prototype, while the handles issuing forth from animal mouths hark back to ancient Chinese bronzes."
Guardian_Figure,The Chinese placed guardian figures inside the entrances of tombs. The size of these tomb figures was regulated by law: a large piece such as this must have been commissioned for a high-ranking member of the nobility as a testimony to his wealth in this life and a reassurance to his spirit in the next.
Six-Post_Canopy_Bed,"<P></P>Typically dressed with quilts and curtains, a canopy bed would have been one of the most important pieces of furniture in a traditional Chinese home. Not considered suitable just for sleeping, beds were used during the day as a means of escape from daily life.

Snuff_Bottle,"<i>Luohan</i>, or arhats, are disciples of the Buddha and guardians of the Buddhist faith. The cult of <i>luohan</i> emerged in the ninth century and rose to prominence during the Song dynasty (960–1279), when classical pictorial representations of these religious figures were formed, often depicted in groups of sixteen, eighteen, or five hundred, based on different scriptural traditions."

Here he is depicted holding a peach, accompanied by a deer and a crane in flight among clouds. These motifs, whether appearing individually or together, convey one’s wish for reaching an old age."
Round-back_Armchair_(Quanyi),"During the Ming dynasty, rounded or horseshoe-backed chairs were reserved for honored guests. The gracefully curving crest rail of each of these examples consists of only three pieces of wood connected by highly developed joinery. The vertical rails, made of a single continuous piece of wood, complete the elegant form."
Wall_Hanging-Plum_Blossom,"Each panel in the set represents a season: the peony for spring, the lotus for summer, the chrysanthemum for autumn, and the plum blossom for winter."
Beaker_Vase_(one_of_a_pair),The unusual shape of this vase combines the classical Chinese bronze beaker form with that of the double gourd.
Lions_and_Foreign_Groom,"Rendered entirely in gossamer-like ink lines, this delicate painting exhibits the baimiao (outline drawing) brush technique, which is quintessential in the history of Chinese painting. This album leaf belongs to a genre of court paintings that portray foreigners offering exotic animals or goods as tribute to the emperor. Such images have a long tradition that goes back to at least the sixth century, serving as auspicious emblems to highlight the strength of the Chinese empire and the virtue of its ruler."
Jar,Made during the Machang phase of the Majiayao culture.
Tea_Merchants,"This scene of tea vendors sampling their wares is based on an earlier scroll painting with an almost identical composition by the artist Qian Xuan (1235-1301). The men are shown pouring tea from large, spouted ewers into small, stacked cups. In the work by Qian Xuan, the men drank from cups mounted on cup stands, which were commonly used during the Song dynasty (960-1279). The nineteenth-century artist who painted this scroll must have had only a muddled understanding of cup stands, as he has rendered them here as stacks of small cups."

Teacup_with_Cover_and_Stand,"Glassmaking has been practiced in China for centuries, but was never accorded the honor or appreciation given to ceramics. Beginning in the Tang dynasty (618-907), glass was used as a cheaper substitute for jade. In the Qing dynasty, semiopaque glasses of various colors were used to imitate various kinds of hard stones, such as the pink jade of which this piece is reminiscent."
Seal,"This four-character seal offers an auspicious wish to its user: ""May you long hold office!"""
Bowl,"Painted in brilliant enamel colors with gilt accents, the scene on this bowl depicts General Guo Ziyi and his wife in a palace pavilion, attended by courtiers and women watching children at play. General Guo was the model of the Confucian soldier-gentleman who had many grandsons and lived to a happy old age."
Plate,"Depicted at the center of this plate is a qilin leaping through a landscape with a phoenix overhead. According to Chinese classical texts, the qilin is one of the four mythical animals—among the phoenix, tortoise, and dragon—that wield miraculous power. The appearance of the creature is considered an auspicious symbol of peace and the righteousness of a ruler."
Plate,"<p>This festive gathering, which shows ladies in boats picking lotus flowers, still occurs in China today. Beijing hosts a lotus festival each summer, when the pink and white blooms fill lakes with spectacular color.</p>

Wine_Bottle,"Ding wares were so popular that kilns around the country copied them. The thinly potted body and lightness of this ovoid bottle distinguish it as an original Ding ware, as opposed to a Cizhou copy, which would be noticeably heavier. According to a Ming dynasty (1368–1644) record, russet-colored Ding wares were rarer than white and so valued more."
"Jar_with_a_Mythical_Qilin,_Lion,_and_Elephant","Many European royals became avid collectors of Chinese porcelain, including Augustus the Strong (1670-1733), elector of Saxony and king of Poland. This jar, formerly in Augustus's collection, exemplifies the virtuoso technical and artistic abilities of the Kangxi period Chinese potters. On a pale green ground-which inspired the European name for the ware, famille verte-the artist has depicted three animals: a lion, an elephant, and a mythical qilin. While the artist who decorated this piece is unknown, many court painters were employed by the porcelain factory established by the Kangxi emperor, himself a devoted collector of these polychrome wares."

Female_Immortals,"Three female immortals wear cloaks and skirts made of grasses and leaves. Their hairy bodies identify them as the Feathered Women (<i>mao nü</i>) of Daoist lore, who live deep in the mountains searching for herbs. Here they show each other what they have gathered. The figure at the far left holds a lingzhi fungus (thought to bestow longevity if ingested) and a basket of plants is draped over her arm. The focus of the painting is on a large health-benefiting ginseng root displayed in the hand of the central immortal. Other herbs depicted include leaves of banana and palm tree carried in the baskets on the women’s backs. The representation of Feathered Women exhibiting precious medicinal items functions as a special talisman, protecting the owner from illness."

Sutra_Cover,"<P></P>Buddhist scriptures, or sutras, that are bound accordion-style are often protected with covers composed of paperboard wrapped in decorative silk. Titles and volume numbers appear on strips of paper adhered to the fabric. The use of silk for sutra covers dates back to at least the Tang dynasty (618–907), but most extant examples are from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and later, when the printing industry grew in China. In some cases, sutra printings were sponsored by the imperial government, resulting in superior editions based on texts from the palace collection.

<P></P>Complex weaves of lustrous silk, sometimes highlighted by metallic thread, made possible a wide array of patterns and motifs. These include floral scrolls, Buddhist emblems, traditional Chinese symbols of blessings, and Chinese characters with auspicious meanings, all of which are also found on Buddhist ritual vessels and implements made from lacquer, gold, silver, and porcelain. 

<P></P>In 1940 more than five hundred sutra covers, along with a significant assemblage of other textiles, were acquired from Carl Schuster, who served as assistant curator of Chinese art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1935 to 1937.

Teapot,"Yixing ware is a fine-grained stoneware prized for its warm range of earth tones and its slight gloss even when unglazed. The clay used in such pieces was first found in Yixing, near Lake Tai in Jiangsu province. Admired by connoisseurs for its harmonization with complex tea flavors, Yixing ware teapots become more valuable over time as repeated brewing and steeping seasons the vessel and enhances the flavor of each serving. The virtue of this miniature teapot lies in its capacity-if the pot is emptied in one pouring, the tea leaves will not stew and the delicate flavor and aroma will not be degraded."
Ritual_Wine_Vessel,"The decorative motif on the broad sides of this vessel is an abstracted face, called a taotie. Common on Shang ritual bronzes, the taotie resembles an animal or monster with horns, claws, and eyes and is shown here emerging from a dense background pattern of squared spirals, known as leiwen."
Tomb_Guardian_Beast,"This tomb guardian appears to be a hybrid creature composed of a horned humanlike head atop an animal body.

Bodhidharma,"The colophon on this work talks about Wangguan, a painter who specialized in Buddhist figures, and Bodhidharma, the subject of the painting. Generally thought to have been a prince in southern India, Bodhidharma (known as Daruma in Japan) became a Buddhist monk and traveled to China in the early sixth century to help propagate Buddhism. He practiced asceticism at the Shaolin Temple in the Songshan Mountains near Luoyang and meditated facing a cave wall for nine years until he was spiritually awakened. Bodhidharma is the twenty-eighth Patriarch of Buddhism and the founder of Zen Buddhism. The priest on the left is his disciple and successor, Huike."
Snuff_Bottle_and_Stopper,"The carved decoration on this bottle expresses auspicious messages, with the hawk, bat, and peach, symbolizing vitality, good fortune, and longevity, respectively."
Snuff_Bottle_and_Stopper,"Plain, undecorated jadeite snuff bottles became popular in the latter half of the Qing dynasty, especially appreciated for their natural color, luster, and smooth, polished surface."
Fifty-Three_Compassionate_Manifestations_of_Guanyin,"Since being introduced to China in the 200s, different forms of the popular <P></P>Buddhist deity, Guanyin (Sanskrit: <i>Avalokiteshvara</i>), have been created by Chinese devotees and artists. An enlightened being who vowed to remain in this world to help others achieve enlightenment, the compassionate bodhisattva Guanyin can assume different forms in response to individual’s needs. 
<P></P>This woodblock is part of the book <i>Fifty-Three Compassionate Manifestations of Guanyin</i>, which was originally produced in the early 1600s, and contains images of Guanyin in his many different manifestations. Published to disseminate popular beliefs surrounding this deity, the book encompasses all the well-known forms such as White-robed, Water Moon, and Child-granting Guanyin, and also includes remarkably inventive versions of the deity appearing as the Buddha and even a European gentleman. Rendered in the fine-line (<i>baimiao</i>) technique associated with the celebrated painter of Buddhist figures, Ding Yunpeng (1547-1621), the illustrations are accompanied by an essay by Hu Yingling (1551-1602), a noted scholar who cited various stories demonstrating the efficacy of Guanyin.
<P></P>The Museum’s nineteen printed images, each now mounted as an album leaf, depicts an image of Guanyin accompanied by a related Chan-Buddhist poem, which differs in composition from most other extant examples printed in the 1700s and 1800s. Unusual also are the many depictions of the Buddhist guardian, Weituo, and inscriptions stating that publication of this book was funded by a Buddhist follower, Hou Huai."

"The_Factories_of_Canton,_China","<P></P>Beginning in 1784, many Philadelphia merchants engaged with the China trade, and proudly owned paintings of their establishment in Canton (Guangzhou), the only port that admitted foreigners. The international community was restricted to a narrow strip of land along the Pearl River, where “hongs” were rented by the different trading nations, represented by the Danish, Austrian, American, Swedish, British, and Dutch flags that line Respondentia Walk in this painting. These buildings included storerooms, offices, a bank vault, and dwelling space for the foreign work force and their Chinese servants.

<P></P>This unusually large and detailed image by an unknown Chinese painter (who probably specialized in this kind of souvenir) descended in the family of Anthony Morris Buckley (1777-1845), who went to China in 1799. Although his ship was captured by privateers, Buckley returned safely to Philadelphia in the summer of 1800. It is not clear how he got this image home; perhaps he ordered the painting when he was in Canton, and it was delivered later on another vessel. The patronage of the image seems clear from the central placement of the American flag, immediately above a Chinese junk that bears an eagle on its stern boards.  Such vessels ferried goods to the ocean-going ships harbored at Whampoa, further south on the river, closer to the sea."
Zhong_Kui_the_Demon_Queller,"<P></P>Known as the fearless captor of ghosts and evil spirits in both China and Japan, Zhong Kui is one of the most frequently portrayed figures of Chinese folklore. Supernatural stories about Zhong appear early on in the Song dynasty (960–1279), where it is accounted that he subjugated two demons for Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang dynasty (618–906). Based on this legend, portraits of Zhong are hung during the Lunar New Year to help expel evil spirits.

<P></P>This painting shows the stout Zhong Kui wearing ceremonial attire of an official, holding a stack of books in one hand and carrying a stringed instrument under his other arm. This is most likely intended to demonstrate the cultural refinement of this boorish-looking warrior, who, as the legend relates, once achieved top rank in the civil service examination."
Bodhisattva,"<p>It is likely this serene bodhisattva was made for a Buddhist temple in northern China. It probably flanked a large Buddha statue set against a mural painting depicting paradise.</p> 

<p>Sculpted in high relief, the deity has inlaid glazed ceramic eyes and traces of its original brightly colored painted decoration and gilding. It also has a cavity in its back that would have been filled with devotional items. Meant to ensure the potency of the statue, the holy offerings included prayers and colored stones representing the heart and other organs.</p>"
Hexagonal_Lantern,"<p>This delicate porcelain lantern is so light in the hand that it feels almost weightless. Candles placed within it would have glowed and flickered through the intricate lattice designs, which required great skill to achieve due to the extremely thin clay. It was not until the early 1700s that artists developed this piercing technique.</p>

Bowl_Dropper,This flower-shaped dish with a hollow stalk handle is a fanciful version of a water dropper. Such dishes were used on a scholar's desk for wetting ink.
Pagoda,"Pagodas are used to mark the burial site of Buddhist relics or the tomb of a Buddhist monk. This carving, modeled after a pagoda, was commissioned by the Qianlong emperor (reigned 1736-95) for a hall located in the imperial park in Beijing. One inscription around the lower middle section of the pagoda says, ""I humbly trust myself to Amituofo,"" and another along the rim of the base states, ""Qianlong period of the great Qing dynasty."" On the underside of the base is a carved mark that means ""Hall of Receiving Light"" (Chengguang dian), referring to the building that housed this carving."

Painted_Textile_from_a_Dress,"This painted silk fragment decorated with Chinese women, deer, and flowers was said to have been brought from China on the ship Alliance by the Philadelphian Robert Morris in 1788. The ship's cargo consisted of $122,608 worth of teas and silks and $252.74 in sundries for Mrs. Morris. Included as well was a mandarin dress, which Morris presented to the Philadelphia Museum, an institution founded by artist Charles Willson Peale (1741-1827) that held natural history specimens, ethnographic materials, and some portraits by Peale. Painted silks were used both for clothing and for furnishings, including wall coverings. A contrasting selvedge, here in yellow, was characteristic of Chinese trade silks."
Moon_Crystal,"This nearly flawless moon carving shrouded in auspicious <i>ruyi</i> (as you wish)–shaped clouds is supported on a base depicting the rabbit of Chinese legend who lives on the moon and who concocts the elixir of immortality. The fifth-century poem on its surface, incised by the renowned artist Zhao Pingchong in the last year of the Qianlong emperor’s reign, tells the story of an ancient ruler who, when parted from his beloved, found solace in gazing at the moon."
Tomb_Guardian_Beast,"Known as <i>zhenmu shou</i> (tomb guardian beast) in Chinese, grotesque creatures like this one served as burial objects to protect the tombs of aristocrats and high officials. They were usually placed at the entrance to the main tomb chambers, together with other ceramic figures, to drive away malevolent forces."
Bread_and_Butter_Plate,"This plate is part of an ornate tea service that belonged to Sarah Logan of Philadelphia and was handed down through the Logan and Cadwalader families.

Each piece bears a number that designates a pattern, by which Howell communicated a customer's choice to his agent in China."
Tomb_Guardian_Head,"This grotesque head once hung inside a tomb chamber, probably as a guardian to protect the deceased. It is rendered in a primitive manner with basic geometric elements that create a fearsome and mystic image. This guardian’s bold facial features are precisely executed with a mix of relief and incised lines on a curved surface, which attest to a studied handling by an experienced carver."
Pomegranate-Shaped_Vase,"As the pomegranate has many seeds, <i>zi</i> (pronounced <i>tse</i>), which is the same character for sons, the fruit conveys wishes for many offspring. The base of this vase holds the mark <i>Haoran tang</i>, which refers to the Hall of Grand Magnanimity in the Forbidden City, or the imperial palace, in Beijing."

Fifty-Three_Compassionate_Manifestations_of_Guanyin,"Since being introduced to China in the 200s, different forms of the popular <P></P>Buddhist deity, Guanyin (Sanskrit: <i>Avalokiteshvara</i>), have been created by Chinese devotees and artists. An enlightened being who vowed to remain in this world to help others achieve enlightenment, the compassionate bodhisattva Guanyin can assume different forms in response to individual’s needs. 
<P></P>This woodblock is part of the book <i>Fifty-Three Compassionate Manifestations of Guanyin</i>, which was originally produced in the early 1600s, and contains images of Guanyin in his many different manifestations. Published to disseminate popular beliefs surrounding this deity, the book encompasses all the well-known forms such as White-robed, Water Moon, and Child-granting Guanyin, and also includes remarkably inventive versions of the deity appearing as the Buddha and even a European gentleman. Rendered in the fine-line (<i>baimiao</i>) technique associated with the celebrated painter of Buddhist figures, Ding Yunpeng (1547-1621), the illustrations are accompanied by an essay by Hu Yingling (1551-1602), a noted scholar who cited various stories demonstrating the efficacy of Guanyin.
<P></P>The Museum’s nineteen printed images, each now mounted as an album leaf, depicts an image of Guanyin accompanied by a related Chan-Buddhist poem, which differs in composition from most other extant examples printed in the 1700s and 1800s.

Ink_Screen_and_Stand,"Small screens like this one were used on a scholar's desk to prevent ink from splashing while it was being prepared, which involved grinding an ink stick on an inkstone and then mixing the ground ink with water. The front of this small screen depicts two scholars engaging in conversation in a garden, while a Chinese poem adorns the reverse."

Inscription,"The stone carvings collectively known as the Wu Family shrines are a series of organized pictorial elements and inscriptions forming a tomb discovered in China's Shandong province in 1786.  The stone reliefs however have been studied since the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279) through ink rubbings of their surface decoration and inscriptions.  These rubbings were created by placing paper over the surface of the stone and rubbing the paper with ink, transferring the stone texture to paper.  They are a commonly referenced historical source for the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), but they often only selectively represent the stone surface and were in some cases likely altered to depict the ""original"" stone, eroding their reliability.  Scholars now interpret the rubbings both as representations of the stone carving and pictorial traditions of the Han dynasty in which the stones were created, and also as a revealing look at attitudes towards the study of antiquity in the Song dynasty (and later years) in which the rubbings entered the study of history."

Panels_from_a_Scholar's_Study,"<P>The scholar's study was one of the innermost chambers of a Chinese scholar-bureaucrat's residence. This example was acquired by the Museum in Beijing, where similar interiors may still be seen in the palaces of the former Forbidden City. Designed to be a contemplative setting away from official duties, the two side walls are lined with hinged, lacquered panels, each with silk-covered latticework at the top and delicately painted landscapes at the bottom. </P>

<P>The study is furnished in a style typical of the period. The hardwood (<i>huanghuali</i>) seen at the back left is of the ""kneehole"" type, long popular in China. It offered ample room for storing the scholar's books, brushes, and writing equipment. The long, narrow table at the right front was designed for painting or looking at scrolls.</P>

<P>The occupant of the study was most likely a highly ranked mandarin, or civil official, who had passed a series of difficult competitive examinations in the Chinese classics in order to attain his position. He was versed not only in the duties of his office but also in music, poetry, and the arts of calligraphy and painting, and was a connoisseur of art with a keen interest in collecting.</P>"

The mongoose represents wealth both because it preys on snakes—the traditional custodians of wealth— and because mongoose pelts were once used to make money bags."
Fifty-Three_Compassionate_Manifestations_of_Guanyin,"Since being introduced to China in the 200s, different forms of the popular <P></P>Buddhist deity, Guanyin (Sanskrit: <i>Avalokiteshvara</i>), have been created by Chinese devotees and artists. An enlightened being who vowed to remain in this world to help others achieve enlightenment, the compassionate bodhisattva Guanyin can assume different forms in response to individual’s needs. 
<P></P>This woodblock is part of the book <i>Fifty-Three Compassionate Manifestations of Guanyin</i>, which was originally produced in the early 1600s, and contains images of Guanyin in his many different manifestations. Published to disseminate popular beliefs surrounding this deity, the book encompasses all the well-known forms such as White-robed, Water Moon, and Child-granting Guanyin, and also includes remarkably inventive versions of the deity appearing as the Buddha and even a European gentleman. Rendered in the fine-line (<i>baimiao</i>) technique associated with the celebrated painter of Buddhist figures, Ding Yunpeng (1547-1621), the illustrations are accompanied by an essay by Hu Yingling (1551-1602), a noted scholar who cited various stories demonstrating the efficacy of Guanyin.
<P></P>The Museum’s nineteen printed images, each now mounted as an album leaf, depicts an image of Guanyin accompanied by a related Chan-Buddhist poem, which differs in composition from most other extant examples printed in the 1700s and 1800s.

Wine_Cup_with_pine_and_gourd,"<p>This wine cup was carved from rhinoceros horn to resemble the rough bark of an old pine tree, a symbol of longevity. A gourd and a fan, two attributes of the Eight Daoist Immortals, hang from branches at the back of the cup.

<p>Rhinoceros horn is highly treasured for its medicinal properties, as it is thought to be able to clear away toxins and heat in the body. During the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368–1911), such carvings gained great popularity, but as rhinoceroses became endangered, other types of horns were sometimes substituted.</p>"

"Dish_with_Rock,_Peonies,_Chrysanthemums,_and_Fungus","This heavy, square dish is decorated in yellow and red enamel on both the interior and exterior with blossoming peonies and chrysanthemums growing to either side of a craggy pierced rock, from which two lingzhi fungi emerge. Rocks together with lingzhi fungus comprised a well-known mid-sixteenth-century motif that was often depicted with the <i>shou</i>, or longevity, character, conveying the wish for immortality—a preoccupation of the Jiajing emperor, under whose reign this dish was made. The peony and chrysanthemum are flowers often seen in representations of the four seasons, symbolizing spring and fall, respectively.

<P>To give visitors a sense of the original context, the Museum installed the ceiling with architectural elements reconstructed from measured drawings made at the original site.

<P>A series of model temples supported by cloud-decorated brackets encompass the central element; within these miniature structures are delicately carved sculptures of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. The remainder of the ceiling consists of square panels painted with stylized lotus flowers that show the influence of Tibetan Buddhism (Lamaism).

"East_Wall,_Third_and_Fourth_Register","The stone carvings collectively known as the Wu Family shrines are a series of organized pictorial elements and inscriptions forming a tomb discovered in China's Shandong province in 1786.  The stone reliefs however have been studied since the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279) through ink rubbings of their surface decoration and inscriptions.  These rubbings were created by placing paper over the surface of the stone and rubbing the paper with ink, transferring the stone texture to paper.  They are a commonly referenced historical source for the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), but they often only selectively represent the stone surface and were in some cases likely altered to depict the ""original"" stone, eroding their reliability.  Scholars now interpret the rubbings both as representations of the stone carving and pictorial traditions of the Han dynasty in which the stones were created, and also as a revealing look at attitudes towards the study of antiquity in the Song dynasty (and later years) in which the rubbings entered the study of history."

"Bowl_with_the_Three_Friends_of_Winter_(Plum,_Bamboo,_Pine)","With its freely brushed design, painted in modulated tones of deep, inky blue against a glossy white ground, the exterior of this bowl represents a popular Confucian theme: the Three Friends of Winter. The Three Friends—pine, bamboo, and plum—were so named for their shared quality of remaining green during the cold winter months. The hardy pine flourishes in harsh environments and is a symbol of longevity; the tall hollow-jointed bamboo shows strength and resilience in its uprightness yet bends and conforms in adverse conditions; and the plum is the first flower to bloom in late winter, representing perseverance. Together the Three Friends came to epitomize the moral characteristics of integrity and fortitude that a scholar-gentleman was to learn and live by."

"Rubbing_from_carved_stone_from_the_Wu_Family_Shrines,_Stone_Chamber_2_(north_slope,_east_side)","The stone carvings collectively known as the Wu Family shrines are a series of organized pictorial elements and inscriptions forming a tomb discovered in China's Shandong province in 1786.  The stone reliefs however have been studied since the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279) through ink rubbings of their surface decoration and inscriptions.  These rubbings were created by placing paper over the surface of the stone and rubbing the paper with ink, transferring the stone texture to paper.  They are a commonly referenced historical source for the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), but they often only selectively represent the stone surface and were in some cases likely altered to depict the ""original"" stone, eroding their reliability.  Scholars now interpret the rubbings both as representations of the stone carving and pictorial traditions of the Han dynasty in which the stones were created, and also as a revealing look at attitudes towards the study of antiquity in the Song dynasty (and later years) in which the rubbings entered the study of history."

Elegant_Gathering_at_the_Studio_of_Inebriating_Ink,"“The Studio of Inebriating Ink” refers playfully to the sophisticated salon and gathering place of Hongwu?(1743–1811), grandson of the?Kangxi?emperor.?The unusual name refers to a quote from an eleventh-century scholar, Su Shi, who described the calligrapher Shi?Cangshu becoming intoxicated from the fragrance of ink while writing, discarding his worries as if drunk on good wine. Here a gathering of renowned scholar-officials engage in the arts esteemed in Chinese literati culture—painting, calligraphy, and poetry. Two poems composed by Hongwu are inscribed following the painting. The painter of the scroll,?Hua?Guan, a native of Wuxi in Jiangsu province,?was known for his portrayals of Manchu nobleman.?He?combined?fine brush technique with subtle shading in naturalistic renderings,?capturing?not only his sitters’ outer likenesses, but also their inner characters.?"
Original_Patriarch_Daruma_Daishi,"<P>Mokuan was the second patriarch of the Japanese Obaku Zen sect, which still has its headquarters at Mampuku-ji, a Chinese-style temple located at Uji, near Kyoto.  He emigrated to Japan from Fukien, China in 1655. The following year he assisted the first patriarch, Ingen (1592 - 1673) in founding Mampuku-ji, and Mokuan became the second abbot in 1664. </P>

<P>The six characters inscribed on this hanging scroll translate to ""the first patriarch Daruma."" This is a reference to the founder of Zen Buddhism in India, whose name is pronounced ""Daruma"" in Japanese. Mokuan may have also meant this phrase to serve as an homage to Ingen (as the first patriarch of the Obaku sect in Japan). </P>

<P>Mokuan was renowned during his lifetime for his outstanding calligraphy, with its strong, thick brushstrokes and subtle gradations of ink. As in this one line calligraphy, the even spacing and rounded characters have a powerful yet elegant effect, balanced by the wiry, angular signature at the left.</P>"
