Guqin (古琴 ),Prince Lu,1634,"Many Ming-dynasty princes, starting with the sons of the founder and continuing until the last generation before the dynasty's fall in the mid-seventeenth century, were accomplished musicians, and some made important contributions to musicology and musical theory. The first prince of Lu (1568C1614), brother of Emperor Shenzhong (Wanli), was an immensely rich man, and hundreds of qin were made for his household and descendants in the last years of the Ming dynasty. Zhu Changfang (1608-1646), the last prince of Lu, commissioned hundreds of guqin . All bear the inscription of the Princedom of Lu, and all are numbered. About ten Prince Lu qin are extant; the one in the Metropolitan Museum, number 18, dated 1634, is the earliest. The highest-numbered Prince Lu qin known is number 295. It is dated 1644, the year the Ming dynasty came to an end.The back of the Museum's qin bears the maker's seal and date, the words ""Capital Peace,"" and a twenty-character poem by Jingyi Zhuren (d. 1670) that reads:The moonlight is being reflected by the river YangziA light breeze is blowing over clear dewdrops,Only in a tranquil placeCan one comprehend the feeling of eternity.Endowed with cosmological and metaphysical significance and empowered to communicate the deepest feelings, the qin, beloved of sages and of Confucius, is the most prestigious instrument in China. Han-dynasty writers state that the qin helped to cultivate character, understand morality, supplicate gods and demons, enhance life, and enrich learning. Ming-dynasty literati who claimed the right to play the qin suggested that it be played outdoors in a mountain setting, a garden, a small pavillion, or near an old pine tree (symbol of longevity) while burning incense to perfume the air. A serene moonlit night was considered an appropriate time for performance. Each part of the instrument is identified by an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic name and cosmology is ever present: for example, the upper board of wutong wood symbolizes heaven, the bottom board of zi wood symbolizes earth. Qins over a hundred years old are considered best, the age determined by the pattern of cracks (duanwen) in the lacquer. The thirteen studs (hui) indicate finger positions. Strings of varying thicknesses are made of twisted silk.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/mi/mobile-large/DP302703.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/503523
Archer's Ring (清   扳指),Wen Zhao,17thC19th century,"In Manchu archery, the bowstring is pulled back with the thumb of the right hand, making a thumb ring essential both to protect the thumb and to ensure a smooth release of the arrow. In addition to their practical function, thumb rings were also worn regularly as personal adornment. All Manchu archers, even the highest ranking aristocrats, favored plain thumb rings of bone or antler for use in hunting and warfare. At other times, however, they wore thumb rings that were highly decorated and made of fragile or precious materials, such as jade, amber or ivory.This ring is inscribed with a line of poetry by Su Shi (1037C1101), a major figure of the Song dynasty, and the name of the ivory carver:The chirping swallows from the eminent Xie family gather at the magnificent hall. Carved by Wen Zhao.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/DP-840-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/30225
Goqing,Chinese,19th century,"Carefully incised veins suggest a downwardly curving lotus leaf of dark nephrite jade. The goqing once sounded to announce the arrival and rank of a guest or to denote the length of a pause following the completion of a musical piece. The great importance of sonorous substances, such as wood and stones, among the percussion instruments of the Far East stems from the religious belief that nature itself speaks to the human ear through this vibrating matter.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/mi/mobile-large/DP216549.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/500637

Pipa (琵琶 ),Chinese,late 16thCearly 17th century,"The pear-shaped lute slowly migrated from Central Asia into China during the Han and Sui dynasties (1st-7th century). It eventually became the pipa; the term describes the original playing motion of the plectrum held in the performer's right hand: p'i, ""to play forward"" (toward the left), and p'a, ""to play backward"" (toward the right). Until the mid-tenth century, the pipa was held horizontally (guitar style), and its twisted silk strings were plucked with a large triangular plectrum. Toward the end of the Tang dynasty, musicians began using their fingernails to execute the exuberant and programmatic repertory that was gaining popularity and that became the national style. To facilitate the use of the fingers, the instrument began to be held in a more upright position. In addition to its use in the opera and in storytelling ensembles, the pipa has a solo repertory of highly programmatic, virtuosic music.The spectacular back and sides of this unique Ming-dynasty instrument feature more than 110 hexagonal ivory plaques, with thinner bone plaques on the neck. Each plaque is carved with Taoist, Confucian, or Buddhist figures and symbols signifying prosperity, happiness, and good luck. These include images of various gods and immortals, such as Shou Lao, the Daoist god of longevity, who is shown with a prominent forehead on the single plaque at the very top. When the instrument is played, this expert workmanship remains unseen by the listener, as the back faces the player. The front is relatively plain but shows signs of use. The ivory string holder bears a scene featuring four figures and a bridge; an archaic cursive inscription; and, at the lip, a bat motif with leafy tendrils. Above the lower frets, two small insets depict a spider and a bird, and just before the rounded upper frets, a trapezoidal plaque portrays two men, one with a fish. The finial repeats the bat (good luck) motif.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/mi/mobile-large/DP319739.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/503651
Dung-Chen,Chinese,1368C1644,"Although Confucianism remained the basis for the structure of government in China, it was Buddhism, introduced in the first century B.C.E., which flourished from the Han to the Tang (206 B.C.E.CC.E. 907). Among the instruments associated with Buddhism was the dung-chen, a long trumpet played for preludes, processions, and morning and evening calls to prayer. It was unusual for musical instruments to be enameled; cloisonné was usually reserved for containers, such as boxes or vases. This Tibetan-style long trumpet was among the many instruments made in China and sent as gifts to impress officials of bordering nations. Gifts of musical instruments and the musicians who played them were common in east Asia. This political custom promoted the dissemination of musical ideas. The dung-chen, like many Asian trumpets, collapses for storage.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/mi/mobile-large/mi1988.349.R.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/503348
Saddle (清    R鞍一套),Chinese,17thC18th century,"In terms of quality and style of workmanship this saddle is extremely similar to some of the best imperial Chinese saddles, such as one owned by the emperor Qianlong (r. 1736C96) and preserved in the Palace Museum, Beijing (G.171546). In addition to its very high quality, this saddle is also exceptional for having all of its original parts, including the elaborate seat cover of embroidered silk and the fittings of the saddletree. Although this type of saddle is often identified as Tibetan, the form of the saddle plates, the style of workmanship, and the type of saddletree, along with the similarity to imperial Chinese saddles, indicate it is more likely to be Chinese, perhaps from the imperial workshops. That it was used in Tibet, however, is demonstrated by the Tibetan letterka, which is branded on the underside of the saddletree as a form of inventory number. It must have belonged to a Tibetan nobleman of the highest rank, possibly received as a gift directly from the imperial court. The saddle plates are made from relatively thick iron, deeply chiseled and pierced, the motifs densely arranged so that the gaps in the scrollwork are narrow. The plates are finely crosshatched and damascened overall with a thick layer of gold foil. The beads of coral and ivory in the center of the pommel and cantle are popular Buddhist symbols called the Three Jewels, representing Buddha, Dharma (Buddhist teachings), and Sangha (the community of believers).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/DP113291.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/26642

Imperial Seal of the Prince of the D?rbed (Four Children) Banner,Chinese,dated 1686,"The Qing emperors consolidated their rule over Inner Mongolia by recognizing the title of prince held by leaders of various Mongol fiefdoms. These fiefdoms were then organized into territorial units known as banners. In return for their loyalty and military support, the princes received full and inalienable rights to rule their banners in alliance with the Qing. To signify that power and authority, the emperor gave each prince a silver seal, surviving examples of which are now exceptionally rare. These imperial seals were inherited by successive princes and venerated as sacred objects, while also embodying the banner’s status and legitimacy within the empire.Emperor Kangxi (reigned 1662C1722) bestowed this seal on the leader of the D?rbed (Four Children) Banner to formalize the banner’s acceptance of Qing sovereignty in 1686. On the underside of the base of this seal, cast in raised letters, is the phrase, in Manchu and Mongolian, Seal of the Prince of the D?rbed Banner. The same phrase is also engraved on top of the base at either side of the tiger, in Manchu on one side and Mongolian on the other. The dual language inscription, Made by the State Ministry, is engraved on the front and back edges of the base; and, Kangxi twenty-fifth year, fourth month [a.d. 1686] is engraved on the side edges of the base.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/LC-L_2017_55_3-012.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/755613

Sword with Scabbard Mounts,Chinese,ca. 600,"This sword is said to have been found in an imperial tomb at Mang Shan, north of Luoyang, Henan Province.

The double-edged blade bears on one side an inscription that seemingly records the circumstances of the sword's manufacture. However, the execution of the writing suggests that the inscription is either a modern addition or an original text that was defaced when the original characters were engraved over in a misguided attempt to make them clearer.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/LC-12_37_145-004.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/25653

Ceremonial Helmet,Chinese,mid-18th century,"The excellent quality and elaborate ornamentation of this helmet indicate that it was made for a nobleman, possibly of imperial status, or a very high-ranking military official. It is decorated with applied ornaments of gilt copper including the Buddhist mantraOm mani padme humin Lantsa characters. The Lantsa alphabet was often used for sacred inscriptions in Tibet, China, and other Buddhist countries. The helmet is very similar to one worn by Emperor Qianlong in a famous equestrian portrait of him painted by the Jesuit artist, Giuseppe Castiglione, and another helmet that was donated by the emperor to a Tibetan monastery in 1757.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/LC-36_25_5a-018.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/35961
Imperial Knife with Sheath,Chinese,18th century,"This elegant knife was intended as a personal accessory for a member of the imperial court, rather than as a weapon. It is part of a group of several known examples, all of which are similar in shape, size, and richness, but with each having some differences, particularly in the style and decoration of the sheaths. The gilding of their blades is a distinctive and highly unusual feature; the steel beneath the gold is purposely roughened to create a mottled, naturalistic surface to contrast with the refined precision of the accompanying hilt and sheath. At the base of the spine of the blade, the Qianlong mark is inlaid in gold letters:Qianlong nian zhi(Made in the Qianlong reign). The decoration on the sheath imitates European gold and enamel work.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/60.107ab_005july2014.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/27397

Imperial Saddle and Stirrups with Bridle,Chinese,18th century,"Skillful horsemanship played a vital role in the military successes of the Manchu and was a key factor in the establishment of the Qing dynasty. Because of this, riding and the use of weapons on horseback for warfare or hunting became important aspects of Qing cultural identity. Elaborately decorated saddles were one highly visible way that Qing emperors and the military elite celebrated their equestrian heritage.The visible areas of this saddle are covered entirely with carved red lacquer. This expensive and time-consuming technique was normally restricted to objects such as dishes and small boxes, which were luxury items made to be appreciated for their beauty and delicacy. Its use on a saddle, even one intended only for ceremonial purposes, is unprecedented and conveys the great wealth, taste, and refinement of its original owner. It is possible that this saddle was made in the imperial Palace Workshops (Zaoban chu), one of which was devoted solely to the production of saddles for the emperor.In addition to their utilitarian function, stirrups, like saddles, were often beatifully decorated. Nearly all stirrups from China, Mongolia, and Tibet incorporated dragon heads into their design on either side of the slot at the center of the arch. This pair is very unusual for its lack of dragons and for its simple but elegant ornament, formed by a pattern of closely set, five-petal flower blossoms.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/LC-L_2017_55_1a_f-010.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/755598

This refinement coincided with the decline of thegeas the foremost of offensive weapons toward the end of the Western Han dynasty. The delicate painted lacquer decoration further emphasizes the ornamental function of these pieces and suggests that they may have been made purely for ceremonial use or specifically as grave goods for the tomb of a high ranking military official.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/2000.262a_002july2014.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/26616
Matchlock Gun with Carved Red Lacquer Stock,Chinese,ca. 1750,"Although typical in its form, this gun is extraordinary, possibly unique, for its decoration, consisting of deeply carved red lacquer covering the entire gunstock and featuring designs of undulating dragons among billowing clouds. This painstaking, delicate, and expensive lacquer technique is usually found on dishes, boxes, and other types of lacquerware intended as presentation pieces or to be appreciated as works of art. Additional ornament is visible on the gun barrel, which is finely engraved along its length with images of dragons and leafy vines.China pioneered the use of gunpowder for fireworks and artillery in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Sophisticated firearms technology, however, developed more rapidly in Europe during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and was then introduced into China by merchants, diplomats, and missionaries during the seventeenth century. Improved designs for cannons and practical types of hand-held guns were eagerly promoted and officially adopted as regulation military equipment under the Qing emperors Kangxi (reigned 1662C1722) and Qianlong (reigned 1736C1795). In addition to mastering the use of bow and arrow and other weapons, both Kangxi and Qianlong owned and used guns, particularly for hunting. This was in keeping with their overall belief in the importance of martial training, which they encouraged by personal example.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/LC-L_2017_55_2-004.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/755608
Ceremonial Saddle,Chinese,17thCearly 18th century,"The intensely intricate designs that cover this saddle are made of small, microscopically thin pieces of abalone shell (commonly called mother of pearl) and gold foil set into a background of black lacquer. Like the carved red lacquer seen on the saddle and gun displayed nearby, this technique was usually reserved for delicate luxury objects such as plates, boxes, or folding screens.For centuries, elaborately decorated saddles were used across Asia, from Japan to the Himalayas, as personal status symbols and as diplomatic gifts. Based on its quality and rarity, this saddle may have been made in the imperial Palace Workshops (Zaoban chu), one of which was devoted specifically to saddlery. Discovered in Tibet in the 1980s, the saddle was probably sent there from China in the seventeenth or eighteenth century as a gift from the imperial court.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/LC-L_2017_55_5ab-041.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/700028

Sword (Ral gri),Tibetan or Chinese,14thC16th century,"This is one of the best examples from a small group of rare early swords from Tibet. The hilt of this sword, including its grip, is made entirely of iron that has been embossed, chiseled, and then damascened in gold and silver. The guard, just below the grip, is in the form of a stylized mask with teeth and fangs, representing a protective deity or guardian figure. Straight double-edged blades of this type are seen more often on Chinese swords, but they were also used in Tibet.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/DP113273.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/24959
Se (瑟 ),Fanfu Lou (Seal of Zha Youci),19th century,"Said to represent friendship and love when played together with the qin, the se, with its movable bridges, is plucked with both hands. This technique, unusual for Asian zithers, permits the player to sound the strings in octaves. Twenty-five multicolored silk strings reflect Chinese cosmology: five are blue, for Heaven, the Azure Dragon of the East; five are red, the luckiest color, associated with the South; four are yellow, for the Earth; the bridgeless white string is not played and symbolizes the West, space, and mourning; five are purple, an imperial color; and five are black, for the North. Se, such as this one from a Taoist temple, were used in rituals and at state ceremonies. Here, inscriptions indicate both the maker, Fanfu Lou, and the owner: ""Treasure collection [of] Monk Xinzhu.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/mi/mobile-large/DP218945.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/503765

Covered Punch Bowl,"Chinese, for Swedish market",1745C55,"This monumental punchbowl, with its original cover and platter, must have been one of the most ambitious porcelains to grace an American colonial household. We can only speculate as to how the bowl, the decoration of which indicates that it was made for the Swedish market, found its way to a prominent Charleston family during the eighteenth century. It was listed among the effects of Mary Brandford Bull, upon her death in 1772, as ""1 large China Bowl Dish & Cover."" The Bulls, one of Charleston's wealthiest families, lived in the grand style. Through the four daughters, the bowl descended in the family and ended up in Philadelphia by 1790. The detailed painted scene on the platter is based on a 1691 engraving of the Swedish Chateau of L?ck?, on Lake V?nern. Two other Swedish chateaus drawn from earlier print sources are represented on the bowl; the cover features two Swedish churches in a landscape with huntsmen, fishermen, and sailors.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ad/mobile-large/DT5525.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/2441

Guqin (古琴 ),Chinese,late 17thCmid 18th century,"Endowed with cosmological and metaphysical significance and empowered to communicate the deepest feelings, this zither, beloved of sages and of Confucius, is the most prestigious instrument in China. Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.) writers state that the qin helped to cultivate character, understand morality, supplicate gods and demons, enhance life, and enrich learning. Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) literati who claimed the right to play the qin suggested that it be played outdoors in a mountain setting, a garden or a small pavilion or near an old pine tree (symbol of longevity) while burning incense perfumed the air. A serene moonlit night was considered an appropriate time for performance. Each part of the instrument is identified by an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic name and cosmology is ever present: for example, the upper board of wutong wood symbolizes heaven, the bottom board of zi wood symbolizes earth. Qins over a hundred years old are considered best, the age determined by the pattern of cracks (duanwen) in the lacquer. The 13 studs (hui) indicate finger positions. Strings of varying thicknesses are traditionally made of twisted silk.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/mi/mobile-large/DP-14776-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/506800

Dung Chen,Chinese,1368C1644,"Although Confucianism remained the basis for the structure of government in China, it was Buddhism, introduced in the first century B.C.E., which flourished from the Han to the Tang (206 B.C.E.CC.E. 907). Among the instruments associated with Buddhism was the dung-chen, a long trumpet played for preludes, processions, and morning and evening calls to prayer. It was unusual for musical instruments to be enameled; cloisonné was usually reserved for containers, such as boxes or vases. This Tibetan-style long trumpet was among the many instruments made in China and sent as gifts to impress officials of bordering nations. Gifts of musical instruments and the musicians who played them were common in east Asia. This political custom promoted the dissemination of musical ideas. The dung-chen, like many Asian trumpets, collapses for storage.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/mi/mobile-large/MIDP1989.33.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/503358

Guanzi (管子 ),Chinese,19th century,"This double-reed pipe is most frequently played for funerals, weddings, regional opera, temple and folk music.

Suona ( ),Chinese,19th century,"Double-reed instruments first appeared during the late Han dynasty, having originated in the Middle East. The term suona derives from zurna, the Arabic name for the instrument. It is depicted, along with many other instruments, in images created from the third to the fifth century in the Buddhist cave temples at Kizil. The penetrating sound of the suona, ideal for processions and military functions, was easily appropriated for popular music. Several varieties are found in China, including a smaller version called a haidi. The player, whose mouth completely covers the small reeds, uses circular breathing (inhaling through the nose) to maintain a constant tone.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/mi/mobile-large/DP216548.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/500597

This example known as a ""banana leaf style"" ( 焦~) or Jiaoye pattern, is a popular variation taking its name from its undulating sides. Other construction elements like the 13 mother-of-pearl buttons (hui) that indicate finger positions remain the same. Two inscriptions, one referencing the owner's discovery of the instrument in 1872 and its restoration, the other relating the story of Zhong Ziqi and Yu Boya appear on the back along with a seal bearing the instrument's name, ""Xiangpu's Treasure"".",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/mi/mobile-large/DP703853.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/670501
Dizi (笛子 ),Chinese,late 19th century,"In addition to a blowhole and finger holes, the dizi, also known as di, has an extra hole covered with a membrane stripped from the inner layer of a bamboo stalk. This membrane, technically a mirliton, provides the flute with a poignant buzzing tone and helps to amplify the sound. There may also be a number of vent holes at the end, from which tassels are frequently hung. Dizi such as this one were used in kunqu opera, one of the styles that contributed to the development of Beijing opera. The two lines of poetry inscribed on this flute are from ""An Autumn Night in a Moonlight Dwelling,"" by the Tang poet Wang Wei (699-761): Bright moon shines in the pines/ Clear stream flows over rocks. The instrument is signed by the calligrapher and/or carver, Wen Shan.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/mi/mobile-large/midp89.4.62 a.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/500635
Huqin,Chinese,19th century,"Two-stringed fiddles (huqin) were introduced into China by nomadic Mongols during the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368). (The presence of ""hu"" in the name of an instrument indicates that it was a foreign import.) Bow hairs passing between the huqin's strings may reflect the Mongol's need to secure the bow to his instrument while on horseback. Huqin are played vertically on the knee, fingered with the left hand and bowed with the right. In earlier times, there existed a greater variety of local fiddles, but today, as with the European family of violins, certain standard sizes prevail.Although this nineteenth-century example has an hourglass-shaped body, the erhu more typically has a round or hexagonal sound box and a snakeskin belly. It is heard in traditional ensembles, modern orchestras, and solo performances. In the opera, it either doubles the melody of a higher-pitched fiddle (jinghu) an octave lower or accompanies female roles. In southern China and Taiwan, it is known as the nanhu.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/mi/mobile-large/DP-13678-006.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/500616

Chinese Poem on Zen Meditation,Feiyin Tongrong,mid-17th century,"Feiyin Tongrong was a Chinese monk who advocated a reassessment of Chan (Zen) practice and its transmission through history, asserting the superiority of the Linji (Rinzai) sect over that of the Caodong (Sōtō). Although he spent his entire life in China, his disciples traveled to Japan, where they established Manpukuji Temple as the center for promoting Feiyin’s ideas. This poem, inscribed in cursive script, conveys Feiyin’s wish to impart his teachings:参禅参到知r 得意分明に普l但看普天秋月夜 一赫涨lI’ve done Zen meditation to the pointwhere I alone get it;Understanding and clarity,to whom might I pass this on?All I see on this night of the autumn moonis how it fills the heavens,A single wheel effulgentlyilluminating the stream before me.―Adapted from Jonathan Chaves",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-23437-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/829393

Surprisingly, one is able to match a piece of British or European porcelain with a Chinese prototype relatively rarely, and it is even more unusual to find an original model that has been copied with such fidelity. This Chinese plate makes an extremely interesting comparison with the Bow example, and both the similarities and slight differences between the two are instructive, as it reflects both the type of Chinese porcelain being imported into England in the second quarter of the eighteenth century and how chinoiserie-decorated porcelains were marketed to English consumers in the middle decades of the eighteenth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/mobile-large/DP-1687-019.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/680348

Platter,"Chinese, for Swedish market",1745C55,"This monumental punchbowl, with its original cover and platter, must have been one of the most ambitious porcelains to grace an American colonial household. We can only speculate as to how the bowl, the decoration of which indicates that it was made for the Swedish market, found its way to a prominent Charleston family during the eighteenth century. It was listed among the effects of Mary Brandford Bull, upon her death in 1772, as ""1 large China Bowl Dish & Cover."" The Bulls, one of Charleston's wealthiest families, lived in the grand style. Through the four daughters, the bowl descended in the family and ended up in Philadelphia by 1790. The detailed painted scene on the platter is based on a 1691 engraving of the Swedish Chateau of L?ck?, on Lake V?nern. Two other Swedish chateaus drawn from earlier print sources are represented on the bowl; the cover features two Swedish churches in a landscape with huntsmen, fishermen, and sailors.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ad/mobile-large/ADA2645.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/6510

Punch Bowl,"Chinese, for American market",ca. 1786C90,"This extraordinary punchbowl features a remarkably faithful replica of the engraved certificate, dated December 1785, issued to Ebenezer Stevens (1751-1823) by the Society of the Cincinnati. Stevens was a major-general in command of the New York artillery and was vice president of the New York branch of the society. The decorative silver-gilt mount on the rim and around the foot were probably made during the early nineteenth century in response to an earlier crack―evidence of the extent to which the bowl was valued by its owner. A related bowl, a polychrome version, was made for Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831). Varick was president of the New York branch of the society while Stevens was vice president. Although Varick's military career was tarnished by his association with Benedict Arnold, he later became Washington's confidential secretary and was mayor of New York from 1789 to 1801. It has descended in Stevens’ family. To the left of the inscription is Cincinnatus, with a giant eagle at his side, holding aloft a flag adorned with the American eagle. Lightning bolts repel the English lion and the figure of Britannia. To the right, against a harbor scene, the horn-blowing Angel of Fame displays the seal of the Society.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ad/mobile-large/DT7939.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/6799

Teabowl with Chinoiserie decoration,Ignaz Preissler,"Chinese porcelain, ca. 1700C20, with Bohemian enamel decoration, ca. 1720C30","This cup decorated with an iron-red band of rinceaux and strapwork populated with Chinese figures is the match to the saucer (50.211.250) already in The Met’s collection. The cup’s decoration is characteristic of the inventive Chinoiserie decorations by Ignaz Preissler, who gained fame alongside his father Daniel as an independent decorator of porcelain and glass. The Preissler workshop painted on a variety of surfaces, including examples of Jingdezhen porcelain that featured earlier forms of Chinese decoration, as seen in the underglaze blue rim on this tea bowl. Based in the Kolowrat estates in Hapbsurg-controlled Bohemia, the Preissler workshop brought great ingenuity and imagination to Chinoiserie designs that moved beyond strict copies of Asian examples. Unlike independent decorators from the free city of Nurenburg who signed their works, Daniel and Ignaz Preissler never included their names. Described as Kolowrat serfs, their commissions were closely dictated by Baron Kolowrat, who also provided them with blank porcelains and glass to decorate.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/mobile-large/LC-2025_13-DEALER.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/918707

Beaker with “Postele?n Verkooping” (porcelain selling),Daniel Preissler,beaker ca. 1700C20; decoration ca. 1711C30,"The Bohemian workshop of Daniel and Ignaz Preissler was active on the Kolowrat estates in Kronstadt (present-day Kunstàt, Czech Republic) and specialized in transforming unembellished glass and porcelain objects with their extraordinary decorations. These typically drew on print sources and their imagination. This beaker made of Chinese Jingdezhen porcelain depicts a pair of porcelain merchants selling their wares in Batavia, the headquarters of the Dutch Vereeinigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC, the trading company that brought Asian porcelain objects to European households. Decorated using Schwarzlot, a technique that used black enamel with fine details scratched with a needle, the beaker is based on a Dutch print by Pieter Schenk. The Preissler workshop has added elements from different print sources, however, as well as their own decorative motifs such as the palm tree, to create an imaginary landscape that shaped the decorative language of Chinoiserie.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/mobile-large/LC-2025_12-DEALER1.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/918706

Liberty,"Chinese, for American market",Ca. 1800,"During the Federal period, America’s growing strength and sense of self inspired countless images celebrating the new nation’s ideal of liberty, of which this painting, Liberty in the Form of the Goddess of Youth Giving Support to the Bald Eagle, is one example. Reverse painted on glass for the American market, the image is based upon a 1796 engraving of the same title by Edward Savage of Philadelphia. One of several surviving examples of this popular image, the painting depicts the Goddess of Liberty standing, supposedly, on Beacon Hill, with Boston Harbor in the distance, a reference to the recent evacuation of the British fleet from the harbor. As Liberty proffers a cup to the descending eagle, she tramples below her feet both the key to the Bastille, symbolizing the death of the monarchy in France, and the Star of the Order of the Garter of Britain, symbolizing America’s freedom from England.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ad/mobile-large/DP205026.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/12929

Summer Mountains,Qu Ding,ca. 1050,"Between the years 900 and 1100, Chinese paint-ers created visions of landscape that depicted the sublimity of creation. Viewers are meant to identify with the human figures in these paintings. In Summer Mountains, travelers make their way toward a temple retreat. The central mountain sits in commanding majesty, like an emperor among his subjects, the culmination of nature’s hierarchy. The advanced use of texture strokes and ink wash suggests that Summer Mountains is by a master working about 1050, a date corroborated by collec-tors’ seals belonging to the Song emperor Huizong (r. 1101C25), whose paintings catalogue re-cords three works entitled Summer Scenery by the otherwise unknown artist Qu Ding.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP226465.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39915

Chessmen (32),Chinese,19th century,"The set was made for the English trade. It is interesting that in embodying the conventional English symbols on disks, it is conforming with the Chinese custom of using ivory or wooden disks identified by ideograms.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/mobile-large/145154.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/200038
Chessmen (30),Chinese,early 20th century,"The meaning of this set is not clear. The red king, Edward VII, and a very Chinese-looking Queen Alexandra, who nevertheless wears European dress, are accompanied by an Episcopal figure whose vestments have not been understood. The knights have very Chinese-looking horses with a hair tuft beneath the mouth (these pieces may be substitutes from another set). The men suggest English dragoons in the uniform of the period 1825 to 1860. The rooks are tall fenestrated edifices like lighthouses, surmounted by a flag. East and West are strangely combined in the pawns, which are distinctive of no particular country. The nature of the white side is equally hard to determine. No opponent of Edward VII would seem to be embodied in the king, though he carries a European scepter. The queen seems Oriental, and the bishop is of a different character from his opponent and might conceivably be meant to be a Russian or Greek bishop rather than a Roman one. The tower also incorporates Greek elements, Doric comumns, for example, a reflection of European neoclassiciam. Again the pawns are curious hybrids of Oriental and Occidental parentage.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/mobile-large/146178.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/200003
Chessmen (32),Chinese,19th century,"These chessmen with baluster stems and finials denoting the rank of the piece are based on European models; the work, however, is unmistakably Oriental. The kings and queens are indicated by crowns, and the bishops by miters; the knights are horse heads, and the rooks have the form of crenelated towers with large flags at the top. The pawns are slim and elegant. The baluster stands all feature a carved, pierced, and undercut knop, which in the rook forms the mass of the tower. The bases are typical of many Chinese sets.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/mobile-large/146527.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/200044
Saber with Scabbard and Belt Hook (清    腰刀),Chinese,probably 18th century,"This saber is particularly noteworthy for the beauty and complexity of its pattern-welded blade. As horseback archers, the Manchus had a unique way of wearing their sabers, with the hilt inclined toward the back rather than the front. This made room for a bow and bow case, which were worn on the left hip over the saber, along with a quiver of arrows on the right hip.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/DP-834-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/31110

Helmet,Chinese,probably mid- to late 17th century,"This helmet is distinctive both for the quality of its workmanship and for the lively character of its engraved and gilt decoration. Because of its overall form and the style of its ornament, it appears to be an early example of helmet types that are usually associated either with the later part of the Ming dynasty (1368C1644) or the more familiar ceremonial helmets of the Qing dynasty (1644C1911).The gilding of the fittings consists of two layers: silver foil burnished onto a crosshatched ground, over which a layer of gold was applied, probably by mercury gilding. This unusual two-stage technique gives the gilding its deep golden yellow luster. It also serves to highlight the crisply engraved ornament, which embellishes the helmet's finial, brim, and brow plate. In the center of the brow is the figure of Buddha Shakyamuni seated on a lotus throne. The Buddha is flanked by the fourlokapala, the heavenly guardians of the four directions. Lively dragons, one on each side of a flaming pearl, appear on the finial and brim, a standard motif on virtually all later Chinese ceremonial helmets. Here, however, the design is rendered with a freshness and originality that are unknown on later, more stereotypical examples. Therefore, the innovative nature of the decoration, combined with the skillful construction of the helmet, suggest that this is a very early example of its type. Like some other rare examples of Chinese art, its survival is apparently due to its preservation in Tibet, where it may have been sent from China during the Ming or Qing dynasties as a gift to a high-ranking secular or religious official.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/DP124307.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/24963

Chessmen (32),Chinese,19th century,"The European king and queen, possibly Carlos I of Portugal and Queen Marie Amélie, are represented by crowned heads, the bishop by an episcopal head wearing an orientalized miter. Their opponents are Chinese, the king with an elegantly fretted headdress. Both knights are horse heads of a type common in European chess sets of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. An echo of Chinese chess, which has pieces named cannons, is in the mortars surmounted by flags for the rooks. The pawns are heads of Europeans or Chinese on baluster stands. The type of chessmen composed of balusters surmounted by human heads appears also in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the nineteenth century (Wichmann, Chess, pl. 156). Pieces of this type are practical for play. The theme is obviously Europeans and Chinese; the combination of Occidental and Oriental features has been satisfactorily accomplished.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/mobile-large/146541.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/200033

Chessmen (30) and board and box,Chinese,18thC19th century,"The red and blue color of the characters is usual in Chinese ivory sets. In the cheaper wooden ones they are yellow and brownish black. The pieces represent: general, counselors, elephants, assistants, horses, chariots, cannons and catapults, and foot soldiers. They are placed on the intersections of the lines, and between the two sides of the board is a space called (Yellow) River. Thus there are ninety places, instead of sixty-four as in the Western game.The substitution of simple disks with the names upon them can be considered the final change from figural chessmen, such as once were used in China, to conventional pieces.The two characters near the hinges on the inside of the board signify together ""River area"" or ""river territory."" The characters on the exterior signify ""article of leisure time"" or ""of recreation"" (leftward of the two vertical legends) and ""not to be lent"" (horizontal legend). other vertical legend consists of proper names, not readable, possibly a club, shop or other resort where object might have been available for communal use.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/mobile-large/LC-48_174_55-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/199938

Pair of Stirrups (清    Z金R一副),Chinese,probably 17th century,"In addition to the sculptural chiseling of the dragon heads on each stirrup, the upright posts are damascened in gold with a hexagonal design representing stylized armor, a pattern that is seen frequently on luxury objects in China and Tibet. The treads of the stirrups are pierced with the design of a symbolic jewel, representing prosperity.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/DP-844-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/27188

Ceremonial Armors for Man (Dingjia) and Horse,Chinese,18th century,"The man’s armor, known asdingjia(armor with nails), is a very elaborate example of the military costume worn at the imperial court by high-ranking officials in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It consists of a jacket with sleeves and an ankle-length skirt constructed of narrow overlapping plates riveted inside the fabric layers with the securing rivet heads visible on the outside. Some of these plates, of brightly polished steel, are exposed on the arms and skirt. Although not intended for use in battle, the jacket is reinforced further with large shoulderpieces, panels under the arms, and a small panel of similar construction that covers the lower abdomen. This fashion thus combines the warrior’s practical but usually plain armor and the ceremonial robes often worn over it.This example is embroidered with gold and colored silk thread, in traditional designs of dragons and waves. The delicately engraved and gilt steel plates at the shoulders repeat these motifs. The helmet is surmounted by a crest of sable tails, coral, and kingfisher feathers mounted with cloisonné enamels. The horse armor has no internal plates but only the rivet heads to give the outward appearance of armor.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/DP275015.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/35726

Ceremonial Armors for Man (Dingjia) and Horse,Chinese,18th century,"The man’s armor, known asdingjia(armor with nails), is a very elaborate example of the military costume worn at the imperial court by high-ranking officials in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It consists of a jacket with sleeves and an ankle-length skirt constructed of narrow overlapping plates riveted inside the fabric layers with the securing rivet heads visible on the outside. Some of these plates, of brightly polished steel, are exposed on the arms and skirt. Although not intended for use in battle, the jacket is reinforced further with large shoulder pieces, panels under the arms, and a small panel of similar construction that covers the lower abdomen. This fashion thus combines the warrior’s practical but usually plain armor and the ceremonial robes often worn over it.This example is embroidered with gold and colored silk thread, in traditional designs of dragons and waves. The delicately engraved and gilt steel plates at the shoulders repeat these motifs. The helmet is surmounted by a crest of sable tails, coral, and kingfisher feathers mounted with cloisonné enamels. The horse armor has no internal plates but only the rivet heads to give the outward appearance of armor.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/DP275015.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/24010

Streams and Mountains without End,Wang Yuanqi,ca. 1710,"Streams and Mountains without End is the grandest surviving handscroll painting from the brush of Wang Yuanqi, one of the most celebrated painters of the Qing dynasty. Subtly varied ink tones describe a vast and constantly evolving riverscape, which unfurls across a handscroll more than seventy feet long. The painting shows many hallmarks of Wang’s typical approach to brushwork and composition―for instance, his layering of brushstrokes and confident interweaving of void and solid. A bold, experimental quality is also evident. Brash contour lines and dotting, along with some particularly daring compositional strategies, make this scroll unusual within the artist’s oeuvre.As the scroll unfurls, Wang cycles through his interpretation of different old master styles, weaving them seamlessly into a cohesive whole. Wang Yuanqi did not sign this work, but he did apply a seal at the very end bearing the character for “servitor” (chen 臣), meaning that he made it for the emperor. This painting, which was documented in the eighteenth century but has been unknown to scholars and painters since, was recently promised to The Met by the family of Lo Chia-Lun, making its debut in this exhibition.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-24888-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/857205

This print, with an engraved poem by the emperor, commemorates the Annam Campaign. It was made by a Chinese engraver after a painting, and was printed from the copperplate displayed next to it.In 1788 the Qianlong Emperor sent troops to Annam (Vietnam) at the request of its ruler, who had fled a rebellion there.

Were it not for its unbroken family history, the close relationship of the design to that on Meissen porcelain would suggest that it had been made for the German or Scandinavian market.

Night-Shining White,Han Gan,ca. 750,"A leading horse painter of the Tang dynasty, Han Gan was known for capturing not only the likeness of a horse but also its spirit. This painting, the most famous work attributed to the artist, is a portrait of a charger of Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712C56). With its burning eye, flaring nostrils, and dancing hoofs, the fiery-tempered horse epitomizes Chinese myths about Central Asian ""celestial steeds"" that ""sweated blood"" and were actually dragons in disguise. The seals and inscriptions added to the painting and its borders by later owners and appreciators are a distinctive feature of Chinese collecting and connoisseurship. The addition of more than one thousand years of seals and comments offers a vivid testimony of the work's transmission and its impact on later generations.The acquisition of this image, arguably the greatest equine portrait in Chinese painting, marked the Director's early commitment to revitalizing the Department of Asian Art under the curatorial leadership of Wen Fong and with the dedicated support of trustee Douglas Dillon.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153705.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39901

The pink crepe lining and two-tiered fringe are two additional details that make this shawl distinctive.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ci/mobile-large/65.184.30_view1_CP4.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/158192
Zhong,Chinese,late 19th century,"Zhong is a generic name for Chinese clapperless bells which appear elliptical in cross-section and feature a concave mouth of opening at the lower end. This beautiful and unique form helps to generate two distinct pitches when the bell is struck. A detail found on many Chinese bells are nine mei, or nipples, grouped in three rows of three. The mei likely had symbolic meaning; the number nine is auspicious in Chinese cosmology and frequently signified the emperor. The mei also appear to play an important part in the acoustics of the bells. Experiments suggest that they clarify the tone by shaping the vibratory patterns of the bell’s surface, helping to stabilize and define the bell’s two distinct fundamental pitches.Description: Clapperless, domeless, asymmetrical, elliptical bell with convex sides, elliptical mouth with central upward arch; front andback join at a ridge (xian) and each side ornamented with an upper and lower section, sixteen nipples (mei) arranged in three rows onthe upper left and right are separated by an unadorned delineated space, the lower section with scroll work; flat, closed upper surfacewith central handle (yong).(J.

Banyan,Chinese,1760C70,"From the sixteenth century, British gentlemen wore loose, informal gowns in the privacy of the home as a comfortable alternative to the stiff and physically restrictive modes of dress required for public settings. Trade through the European East India companies led to new styles of gowns, which were often made of imported materials and variously called nightgowns, morning gowns, India gowns, or banyans. This banyan, composed of a Chinese export silk and quilted for warmth, represents a more fitted style that developed in the mideighteenth century. Fitted banyans reflected a hybrid of Persian, Turkish, and Indian influences but followed the silhouette of contemporary European coats, making them well suited to wearing informally in town or when receiving guests at home. An essential garment for fashionable men, this elegant but functional form of “undress” suggested an urbane, worldly masculinity.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ci/mobile-large/DP159190.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/139667
Shawl,Chinese,1885C1910,"The embroidery on this Chinese shawl is unique in its imagery and level of animation, especially in the realistic depiction of birds and their actions (eating insects, for example). Other atypical details include fruit (pineapples and grapes) and fanciful insects and plant pods. Most of the embroidery is executed in a standard satin stitch but the tails of the grey birds are done in a fine herringbone stitch that imitates the texture of feathers. The fretwork along the border is an unusual touch for shawls made for the Western market.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ci/mobile-large/67.252.3_CP4.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/158244

Shawl,Chinese,1885C1910,"This foldover shawl is a tour de force of Chinese embroidery.

Xiao ( ),Chinese,late 19th century,"There are two types of Chinese end-blown flutes: those like this xiao, associated with central China, with a small U-shaped hole cut into the closed nodal end of the bamboo tube; and those from southeastern China and Taiwan called dongxiao, also seen in this case, with a completely open blowing end. Legend holds that this particular type of end-blown, notched flute was created by disassembling a panpipe called a paixiao and placing equidistant finger holes on each pipe. Used in Confucian ceremonies, including weddings and funerals, and often associated with scholars, xiao are sometimes inscribed with poems.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/mi/mobile-large/midp89.4.56 (1).jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/500629

Sheng ( 笙 ),Chinese,late 19th century,"Southeast Asian in origin and used before the twelfth century B.C., the sheng also played an important role in Confucian music. Now, it accompanies folk songs and is occasionally used in the Beijing opera to add harmony. Similar to the Western harmonica, which it inspired, the sheng is the only Chinese wind instrument capable of sounding many notes at the same time. It is played by blowing and sucking.

Yueqin (月琴),Chinese,19th century,"The resemblance of this round lute to the full moon (yue) gave it its name. The yueqin developed from a much larger long-necked lute that appeared in the Qin and Han dynasties. Its four strings are tuned in pairs, a fifth apart. Like the sanxian, it encloses a vibrating plate. Found in popular ensembles and the Beijing opera and used to accompany song, the yueqin has not been fully embraced by the modern Chinese orchestra. The player presses the strings between the high frets making chord playing difficult but giving increased control over the timbre and intonation. Strings are plucked with fingernails or a pick using up- and down-strokes and tremolo techniques that sustain and give color to a tone.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/mi/mobile-large/DP218943.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/500626

Suona ( ),Chinese,late 19thCearly 20th Century,"Double-reed instruments first appeared during the late Han dynasty, having originated in the Middle East. The term suona derives from zūrna, the Arabic name for the instrument. It is depicted, along with many other instruments, in images created from the third to the fifth century in the Buddhist cave temples at Kizil. The penetrating sound of the suona, ideal for processions and military functions, was easily appropriated for popular music. Several varieties are found in China, including a smaller version called a haidi.

Originally used with drums and loud wind instruments in state processions and military events, this type of trumpet served a number of purposes during the nineteenth century. It was played in pairs by soldiers, blown by firefighters when they had finished putting out a fire, and sounded at funerals and at the end of some theatrical performances. Itinerant knife grinders and peddlers used a smaller version.

The renowned landscapist Wang Hui was commissioned to record the journey in a series of twelve oversize handscrolls. This scroll, the third in the set, highlights the emperor’s visit to Mount Tai, China’s “Sacred Peak of the East.” Although Wang based his design on maps and woodblock prints ― he never visited the mountain ― he also connected specific sites with imaginary landscape passages inspired by classical precedents and employed a traditional “blue-and-green” palette to underscore the emperor’s beneficent rule.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP105303_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49156

According to his epitaph writer, Zhou Nanlao (1308C1383), ""in his late years, he became quieter and more withdrawn than ever. Having lost or given away everything he ever owned, he did his best to forget his worries. Wearing a yellow [Daoist] cap and country clothes, he roamed the lakes and mountains, leading a recluse's life.""Woods and Valleys of Mount Yu, executed two years before Ni Zan's death, expresses the painter's contentment in the life of a recluse. The poem ends with the lines:We watch the clouds and daub with our brushesWe drink wine and write poems.The joyous feelings of this dayWill linger long after we have parted.The dry but tender brushwork is aloof and restrained.

It transcribes an account of a rivalry between two officials: Lian Po, a distinguished general; and Lin Xiangru, a skilled strategist. Huang’s transcription ends abruptly with Lin’s words: “When two tigers fight, one must perish. I behave as I do because I put our country’s fate before private feuds.” Read in the context of Song political infighting, Huang’s transcription becomes a powerful indictment of the partisanship that led to his own banishment in 1094.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153769.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39918

When Yang’s favorite general, An Lushan, rebelled in 755, she was blamed. Forced to flee from the capital at Xi’an to the safety of Shu (Sichuan Province), the emperor was confronted by mutinous troops demanding the execution of his lover. Reluctantly assenting, Xuanzong looked on in horror and shame and abdicated soon after. This painting depicts the somber imperial entourage after the execution.

Chessmen (32),"Chinese, probably Beijing",19th century,"The rooks are elephants with circular towers on their backs surmounted by flags; a mahout sits on the elephant's head. The elephants are carved in a curiously wooden manner, far less skillfully than the horses with which the Chinese were familiar. The bases are deeply undercut to form an open design of flowers and leaves. Chinese ivory sets are often carved with great skill and furnished with ornamental bases, some, like these, being foliated. In others carved balls are incorporated in the baluster support or movable concentric balls. These sets were made as gifts for foreigners, or for sale to them, and well-known foreign personages were incorporated into many of them. Others, such as this, consist entirely of Chinese figures, usually with some of the characteristics of the Manchu dynasty, which reigned throughout the nineteenth century and on to 1912. It has been suggested that some of these sets represent Chinese versus Mongols, but the iconographical details here do not bear out the suggestion-it is a fanciful opposition.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/mobile-large/ES5903.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/199958

She then commissioned the young virtuoso painter Gai Qi to illustrate her poems. Although some of the scenes take place indoors, several of them feature garden settings, including the ones you see here.

Pair of Stirrups,Tibetan or Chinese,19thCearly 20th century,"These stirrups are interesting as late examples in the continuum of traditional stirrups from the Tibetan plateau.

This pair appears to date from the mid to late nineteenth century or even early twentieth century, and bridges the gap between other examples in the Museum's collection, not only chronologically, but also in terms of form and style. They are unusual for the very streamlined, almost art deco, treatment of the dragonheads; for the prominent inclusion ofqilin(so-called Chinese unicorns) in the decoration, a motif seldom found in a Tibetan context; for the style of the damascened decoration, reminiscent of late Tibetan and Chinese metalwork; and for the use of gold leaf, which is unusual, possibly unique, in the decoration of stirrups from this region.

Woman at her dressing table,Leng Mei,18th century,"A woman sits before a large bronze mirror at a dressing table. Her attendant, who stands behind her, places a sprig of blossoming China rose into her coiffure. Glancing sidelong into the mirror, the seated woman beholds her reflection.The setting is a finely appointed studio with a scholarly air, filled with books and scrolls of painting and calligraphy. A large banana plant, visible through a circular window, indicates that the room is adjacent to a garden. The luxurious accoutrements that fill the interior space indicate the woman’s education and refinement. Among the books that fill the shelf behind her, a single title is visible: Retrospective of poems by Famous Women (Mingyuan shigui 名媛w), an anthology of poems written by female authors throughout Chinese history. On the table, an inkstone and a water pot indicate that the woman herself is a writer.Other accoutrements suggest that the woman may be a courtesan. These include the boxes on the table―made for storing cosmetics and adornments like hairpins and earrings that she wears―and the flute hanging on the wall behind her, a nod to the association between musical entertainment and the pleasure quarters. In premodern China, the loftiest courtesans were women of status and power whose ability to engage in poetry and other scholarly arts was part of their appeal for their companions. The artist who painted this work captured well the combination of scholarly elegance and sensuous luxuriousness that would have made the courtesan’s quarters a place of unique allure. The curtains that open to reveal the scene to the viewer heighten the sense of a stolen glimpse into a privileged space.The artist has paid obsessive attention to the objects that fill the space, creating a riot of layered textures. The tiers of patterned silks that adorn both women, the nesting lacquer boxes, the lovingly described mottled pattern of the stone inlaid into the table top, the gnarled rootwood stand that supports the mirror―all of these add to the sumptuousness of the artwork and were clearly core elements of the painter’s craft.The painter Leng Mei, to whom this artwork is attributed, trained at the court of the Kangxi Emperor, where European painting techniques were fashionable and were sometimes incorporated into Chinese paintings. This hybrid visual mode is evident in the current painting in the teapot to the proper right of the seated woman’s head, which reveals an awareness of how to create the illusion of spatial recession and how shading in the European fashion can impart a sense of volume. Shading has also been applied to the legs of the table to indicate a single light source, a technique that was not used in China prior to its adaptation from European painting in the seventeenth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-34237-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/910543

Each plate is chiseled from a single piece of iron. The long, thin four-clawed dragons, carved in high relief in great detail, are cut entirely free from the surrounding scrollwork ground so that they can move slightly within it. The scroll patterns are undercut to give the appearance of depth and overlap, in addition to the areas where the bodies of the dragons actually do overlap. There is a Wish-Granting Jewel motif made with pieces of blue and green turquoise set in shaped compartments in the center of both the pommel and the cantle, and scattered lotus blossoms made in the same way. The outer edges of the plates are bordered by rows of semicircular pieces of lapis.

Miscellaneous Studies,Chen Hongshou,one leaf dated 1619,"This album plays on the theme of reality versus illusion. The moon is reflected in a basin of water, a flower is next to its image in a mirror, and a butterfly is attracted to chrysanthemums painted on a silk fan. Chen emphasized the multiple levels of his artifice on this album leaf by incorporating his signature within the composition of the fan painting and by screening one wing of the butterfly with the fan, forcing us to view the insect through the painting as well as through the medium of painting. Other artful manipulations are represented by a miniature potted garden, or penzai (bonsai, in Japanese), which shows how man can transform nature, and by a twig with worm-eaten leaves, which underscores how nature constantly transforms itself.There is no precedent for these symbolic still-life subjects in scholar painting. Instead, these highly sophisticated images, which relate to the ornamental designs found on deluxe crafts of the time, including molded ink cakes, printed stationery, and the carved decoration of Yixing ceramics, reflect Chen Hongshou's early involvement in creating woodblock illustrations for novels and dramas.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP157285.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/37395

Excerpt from “Song of Leyou Park”,Zhang Jizhi,13th century,"Zhang Jizhi, the last important calligrapher of the Song period, was a devout Buddhist who often transcribed religious texts as an act of devotion. He obtained his jinshi degree, the highest rank in the civil service examination, but never rose to high office. As a calligrapher, however, his fame spread beyond the borders of the Song to the Jin empire in northern China as well as to Japan, where his handwriting was particularly prized by Zen monks. Zhang was noted for his forceful large-character standard script, with its boldly contrasting blunt and sinuous brushstrokes. This piece, remounted centuries ago in Japan for display in a tokonoma, was cut from a long handscroll transcribing a poem by Du Fu (712C770) in such a manner that the poetic phrasing of the original is completely fragmented. The original two couplets may be translated as follows (the text of this scroll is on the fourth and fifth lines):Heavenly gates open in clear skies,ripples vastly trembling;By the Serpentine, kingfisher curtainshang arrayed with silver plaques.Brushing the water, hovering,dancing sleeves flutter;Climbing to the clouds, crisp and clear,the sounds of songs arise.(Translated by Jonathan Chaves)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-35702-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39534

Here, in one of his earliest extant works, Wu Bin embraced an archaic figure style and followed the tradition of depicting luohans as fantastic eccentrics whose grotesque features belie their inner spiritual nature.

Old Man Boating on a River,Zha Shibiao,未知年代,"Zha Shibiao was born in Xiuning, Anhui Province, but spent the latter part of his career in the prosperous commercial center of Yangzhou. Like many Anhui artists, Zha favored the Yuan recluse painter Ni Zan (1306-1374) as his artistic model. However, Zha, unlike his fellow townsman Hongren (1610-1664), often chose to disregard Ni's dry and sparse style. This large painting is typical of the wet, uninhibited ""ink play"" of Zha's mature years. The poem Zha transcribed suggests that he had a specific style in mind for this painting. The poem was composed by the noted scholar-artist Mi Fu (1052-1107). Zha's rendition follows the calligraphic style of the original manuscript so closely that he must have seen either it or a close copy. Inspired by the poem's imagery, Zha also adopted the large, horizontal ""Mi texture dots"" for his pictorial interpretation. The poem describes the scenery of the Xiao and Xiang region of Hunan Province:In Shabu everything is harmonious,In Songmen rafts are covered.Carefree, I casually row my boat,As if traveling in a picture of the Shanxi River.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/69_242_7.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49130

The contrast between pale ink washes and dark dots that enabled Gong to achieve both incredible density and translucency in his paintings is echoed by the contrasting dark and pale passages in his poetic inscriptions, which reflect the artist's spontaneous reinking of his brush.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP161003.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/65620

Wen's painting presents an idealized vision of life in retirement: separated from the outside world by a stream and a rustic wall, two friends enjoy each other's company in a two-story hall that is further isolated in a tall grove of trees. Wen elaborates on the pleasures of such a life in his accompanying poem:Immortals have always delighted in pavilion-living,Windows open on eight sides-eyebrows smiling.Up above towers and halls well up,Down below, clouds and thunder are vaguely sensed.Reclining on a dais, a glimpse of Japan,Leaning on a balustrade, the sight of Manchuria.While worldly affairs shift and change,In their midst a lofty man is at ease.(After Ling-yün Shih Liu, trans., in Richard Edwards et al., The Art of Wen Cheng-ming [1470C1559] [Ann Arbor: Museum of Art, University of Michigan, 1976], p. 150)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP274197.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39536

Anchorage on a rainy night,Shen Zhou,dated 1477,"Anchorage on a Rainy Night illustrates how Ming scholar-artists intertwined poetry and painting to create a vehicle for intimate exchanges among a close-knit circle of friends. Radiating a mood of subdued introspection, the painting mirrors Shen's state of mind less than two months after his father's death, when he found solace in a friend's company. Shen drew on the pictorial vocabulary of the Yuan artist Huang Gongwang (1269C1354): softly contoured peaks, flat plateaus, and outcrops of round boulders accented by dark foliage dots and a few foreground trees. But Shen simplified Huang's complex brush idiom to a few brush conventions and a narrow range of ink tonalities, and he reduced Huang's richly articulated compositional structure to a geometric scheme of repeated diagonals in which the wedge-shaped foreground, receding stream, echelon of successively taller trees, and distant mountain slope all point toward the upper right, where he added a poetic inscription that places his visual tone-poem in context:Sparse paulownia leaves bring drops of morning dew,East of the ancient city in the rising sun's slanting rays,Swallows fly low over the overflowing pond.Thus I know that tonight the spring rain will be plentiful,How fitting that fish should leap and ducks swim.On the twentieth day of the last [lunar] month of spring in the dingyou year [May 2, 1477], I lodged on a boat tothe east of the city with Weide. After the rain, everything grew quiet. I did this picture and poem to capture the mood.In response to Shen's poem, his close friend Wu Kuan added a poem following the same rhyme scheme along with the observation that the harbor Shen has described is none other than the one fronting a farmhouse owned by Wu's family.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP235605.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49549

Lan, a prolific and skilled professional artist, nevertheless won them over, transcending his status as a professional and gaining provisional entry into the class of scholar-painters. Lan adopted Dong’s practice of making old-masters albums, and this is one of his finest.

Landscapes after Tang-dynasty poems,Sheng Maoye,mid-17th century,"Sheng Maoye, a professional painter active in his native Suzhou, shows in his work a lively interest in the shifting atmospheric effects of landscapes in mist and rain or of clouds at twilight or dawn. In these album leaves, images suggested by couplets excerpted from Tang-dynasty (618C907) poems provided the springboard for the artist's imagination. Sheng's interest in exploring the descriptive potentials of monochrome ink―sometimes with the addition of pale colors―to suggest different states of atmospheric realism was shared by his contemporaries in the Nanjing area, including Fan Qi (1616Cafter 1694) and Gong Xian (1619C1689).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP160989.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72262
The Quarrymen (Hewing Rocks),Wang Qi,1944C45,"In the early 1940s, Wang Qi created a series of prints depicting people and customs in Sichuan. This one presents an overview of a quarry at high noon from the perspective of two workers taking a break in the shade. The stark contrast of black and white brings out the intensity of scorching sunlight and the brutality of the harsh working conditions.A student of Western painting at the Shanghai Fine Arts College, Wang Qi left east China at the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and later attended the Lu Xun Institute of Literature and Art in Yan’an. He returned to his hometown, Chongqing, in late 1938 and pursued woodcuts as a more expedient wartime art form.

Water dropper in the form of a mythical creature,China,18th century,"This water dropper has a similar look to the bronze water dropper in Japanese scholar Ichikawa Beian’s collection. Made of porcelain, it is an artful evocation of ancient bronze examples. The work also draws attention to the technical virtuosity of the potter, whose use of a greenish-brown glaze successfully mimics the patina of an ancient bronze.

Poems from the Pavilion of Fundamental Truth (Zhenyi Ting),Zhou Lianggong,Undated,"This album preserves a group of poems written by the great art patron and critic Zhou Lianggong (1612C1672). Zhou was one of the key figures in the art scene of the mid-seventeenth century; he fostered contemporary painters and also wrote about their accomplishments. His critical writings on painting were published in 1673 under the title Duhua lu (A record of [The Pavilion] for viewing paintings), and they have been considered the essential source on seventeenth century painting ever since. This album preserves versions of some of the material that appears in Duhua lu, which makes it a source of signal importance for the study of Zhou Lianggong, the art scene he fostered, and his career as a critic.Zhou was well regarded as a calligrapher. His signature style, evident throughout this album, features a juxtaposition of thin ligatures with blocky, angular lines to create a charmingly eccentric and somewhat raw effect. In this, Zhou was particularly influenced by the calligraphy of the Song dynasty (960C1279) Emperor Lizong (1205C64, r. 1224C64), who pioneered this style in the thirteenth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-13240-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/701293

Poem on Promulgating the Almanac at New Year’s,Wen Peng,undated,"On this large piece of brownish paper, Wen Peng, an eminent painter, calligrapher, and seal carver of the Ming dynasty (1368C1644), transcribed a poem in running-cursive script in five columns. The poem reads,The timeCannouncer waits for daybreak by the imperial hall.The elegant palace where multitudes of officials gather exudes fresh grandeur.At the turn of the year, I feel ashamed for passing the time doing nothing.The issuing of calendar, appropriate for spring, happens to take place on a spring day.The twilight of dawn initiates the path of the sun,As if the smoke from incense burners were spreading over the royal court.The promulgation of the almanac has always been a significant event.What an honor that the profound grace reaches even a humble official!Wen Peng呛篾a人，玉殿千官庀笮隆８q自M^日，授r春得又逢春。熹微曙色_S道，z散紫宸。C朔魇⑹拢覃恩何幸及微臣。文彭The text is followed by three artist’s seals: “Wen Peng zhi yin” (文彭之印), “Wen shi Shoucheng” (文氏鄢), and “Guozi xiansheng” (子先生).The poem describes the ritual of issuing the coming year’s almanac presided by the emperor, which took place at court at the beginning of the year during Wen Peng’s time. Wen served as Erudite of the Directorate of Education (Guozijian boshi) in Nanjing, the secondary capital. Although he was nominally affiliated with the same institution in Beijing, there is no record of his taking office in the capital. This poem could be inspired by a similar ceremony held in Nanjing which he witnessed, or an exercise in the conventional genre of court poetry. Composed probably on an occasion associated with the ceremony, the poem reveals how Wen embraced his identity as a court official.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/TR_138_1_2012_0002.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77914

The individual leaves range from monumental landscape scenes in the manner of Wang Meng (ca. 1308C1385) to intimate studies of isolated trees and rocks in the style of Cao Zhibo (1272C1355).

"Bodhisattva, probably Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin)",China,ca. 550C560,"Large-scale sculptures of bodhisattvas wearing extraordinary jewelry epitomize stylistic and iconographic innovations in Chinese sculpture from the second half of the sixth century. The astonishing jeweled harness adorning this bodhisattva is made up of two long strands of pearl-like clusters and multifaceted beads. Some elements, such as the triangular pendants, have Chinese precedents. Others, such as the pearl cabochons, derive from Central Asian traditions. The appearance of such elaborately figural sculptures, which later became standard in Chinese Buddhist art, attests to a growing devotion to Avalokiteshvara in the second half of the sixth century. It is possible that the jewels refer to a passage in the Lotus Sutra in which the historical Buddha Shakyamuni and another bodhisattva extol Avalokiteshvara’s great compassion and presents him with a pearl necklace as a symbol of his benevolence.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP213356.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42718

The Character of Characters,Xu Bing,2012,"徐冰 汉字的性格 水墨赢Throughout his career, Xu Bing has grappled with the power of the written word. His iconic installation Book from the Sky (1987C91) surrounds the viewer with thousands of Chinese characters that, upon closer examination, are invented nonsense words. He followed that with Square Word Calligraphy (1994), a system for writing English that looks like brush-written Chinese; for readers of English, Square Word Calligraphy inverts Book from the Sky, providing a breakthrough to meaning where none was apparent at first. In this new work, created specifically for “Out of Character,” Xu continues to engage with the written Chinese word, providing a sprawling and thoughtful meditation on the development of Chinese characters and their systematization as calligraphy.

The complete set was decorated and assembled in China for the export market; although the front and back of the chasuble were each made in a single piece, the chasuble's Chinese designers evoked the European convention of sewing together separate side panels and central ""orphrey"" strips. At some point in its history, the chasuble needed considerable repairs after the wear-and-tear of decades' use worn by priests: patches cut from a matching item in the vestment set were very carefully applied to the garment's front around the chest area, the seams and joins hidden by a broad, nineteenth-century passementerie braid, which has since been removed.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/mobile-large/200524.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/229408
Plate,"Chinese, for British market",1800C1810,"The Helena Woolworth McCann collection of Chinese-export porcelain is a lasting tribute to the knowledge and judgment of the collector whose name it bears. The objects in her collection, consisting of about 4,000 pieces, of which 441 were generously given to The Met, were made in China to the order of European and American clients during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. Assembling such a comprehensive and distinguished group not only called for rare insight and informed taste, but required extensive travel and search in Europe. The typical collector of this material focuses on wares destined for one region: the Continent, England, or America. Mrs. McCann, however, collected without regard to the market, the resulting collection thus reflecting the variety and extend of the trade in Chinese porcelain throughout the Western world at the peak of its popularity.Following her untimely death in 1938, her children gave the collection to the Winfield Foundation, created in her memory for educational and charitable purposes. Today, Mrs. McCann's extraordinary collection of Chinese export porcelain is dispersed among twenty-six museums in the United States and one in Canada, and has been made accessible to the public as a source of pleasure and instruction.

Wall panel with garden urns,"Chinese, for European market",late 18th century,"The Chinese produced both painted wallpaper and painted silk wall hangings for export during the eighteenth century, and the workshops that made these wall coverings may have used the same patterns for both techniques. Silk wall coverings accounted for a very small percentage of the textiles exported from China to the West.1 Along with the painted papers, however, their influence on the perception of chinoiserie in Europe is probably disproportionate to the actual number produced, as these wall coverings became closely associated with the invention of the ""Chinese room,"" an essential feature of European country houses and retreats.2Painted pictorial wall decorations were entirely new products developed specifically for the European export market. Nothing like them were used in domestic Chinese interior decoration. The antecedent may have been the Chinese practice, noted by early travelers, of using monochrome paper coverings on their interior walls to create the effect of a uniformly white wall, without other decoration.3 Painted silk may have been used as a substitute for paper in the eighteenth century, as suppliers had a difficult time manufacturing enough paper to meet the requirements of European clients. In 1759 one such customer, Emily Lennox (1731C1814), great-granddaughter of Charles II of England and wife of James Fitzgerald, Earl of Kildare (1722?1773), commissioned her husband to buy her 150 yards of painted taffeta for bedroom furnishings while he was in London. Although the acquisition of this amount in a single pattern was said to be impossible, he finally succeeded, and according to Emily the painted ""Indian"" silk was only slightly more expensive than a silk damask available in Dublin, and infinitely more attractive.?Paper hangings depicting garden scenes with flowering trees that grow from large Chinese vessels resting on decorative stands are preserved in several German and English collections.? This painted silk also appears to be influenced by Indian chintz palampores, with their delicate meandering branches bearing a variety of fruits and flowers and populated by assorted small birds and insects. Here the regular meander and the delicacy of the design are closer to the dress silks of the later eighteenth century than to the more regimented garden scenes of the wallpapers. It is a charming hybrid of the Chinese and Indian motifs that continued to be popular into the late eighteenth century.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]Footnotes1.

Textile with crowned double headed eagles,"Chinese, Macao, for Iberian market",second half 16th century,"Crowned and splayed double-headed eagles, symbols of the Habsburg dynasty, are woven into this Chinese textile, one of a large group of related examples made for the Portuguese and Spanish market in the last part of the sixteenth century. The group represents an early production for export of complex woven silks that integrate both Iberian and Asian aesthetics and design. In this example, the eagle holds in its talons arrows that pierce a heart-shaped vase. The device of a heart pierced by arrows is associated with the Augustinian religious order, while representations of floral vases were popular motifs in China.The conflation of pious and secular imagery seen here may be the result of free rein being given to the master weaver commissioned to produce the cloth. Although the pattern, colors, and general layout have a notable European character, a number of details point to an Asian hand in the design. The form of the oddly shaped leaf on the scrolling vines, for example, resembles Chinese floral patterns more than the European acanthus leaves we might expect to find, especially as associated with the grapelike fruit cluster motif that repeats throughout. Additionally, the stylized dark blue flowers are Chinese peonies; they alternate with the eagles, whose extended, erect neck feathers and patterned breasts recall the graphic means sometimes used by Chinese artisans to render the image of a phoenix. It could be that the weaver modified an original source (perhaps a European print) to incorporate these Asian elements within the overall European format.A related group of silks, possibly from a different workshop, shares some of the design features seen here, including the arrow-holding double-headed eagles amid scrolling vines, although in that group the eagles are contained within narrow vertical panels delineated by leafy borders. Multiple examples of textiles with this design exist; in general, they have the same crimson red (lac dye) ground and are decorated in two colors, blue and yellow. In addition to silk, these fine woven textiles incorporate flat threads of gold leaf on paper, typical of East Asian works.1 A complete cope (Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto) and a portion of a chasuble (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) made of this fabric confirm that it was used in Christian ecclesiastical vestments.2 The exact location of production for this group of silks is unknown, but the combination of Iberian and Asian motifs and styles is typical of products exported through Macau, a major center of trade in the sixteenth century.Although other Macau silks possess similar design elements, the color scheme of this example, with its pattern of green, blue, and yellow, is distinctive. It has been proposed, based on the motif of the arrow piercing the heart, that the fabric was made specifically for Augustinians active in the Philippines, but examples found in Spain, Portugal, and other European centers suggest it may have been part of the larger Iberian trade.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]Footnotes:1.

"Folding Cabriolet Fan with Multiple Scenes of Performers, Landscapes, and Figures in Courtyard Gardens","Chinese, for the European Market",19th century,"Cabriolet fans like this one are distinguished by their multiple leaves, divided by arcs of exposed sticks. Set one above the other, they suggest the spoked wheels of ""cabriolet"" style horse drawn carriages. This fan is a spectacular example of Chinese work made to appeal to the European market: colorful painted scenes, with applied faces of ivory and real silk clothing, contrast with distinctive, wide, tortoiseshell sticks and guards, further decorated with golden lacquerwork: a procession of figures, floral posies, insects, tassels and masks.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/mobile-large/DP-12912-088.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/209696

Coffeepot,"Chinese, probably for Dutch market",ca. 1710,"This model of coffeepot appears to be the earliest produced in China for export to Europe. Its tall, tapering octagonal form was influenced both by Dutch Delftware coffeepots and by English silver coffeepots. This early production of coffeepots for export to the West reflects the speed with which the Chinese export ceramic industry responded to the growing demand for coffee wares in Europe. This form proved hard to fire because of its straight sides and angles, and it soon was replaced by a more easily produced cylindrical model.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/mobile-large/DP-13079-013.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/206776

Coverlet,"Chinese, for European market",17th century,"Embroidered in China with a dragon roundel at its center and four distinctive figures dressed in European garments in the surrounding field, this coverlet reflects the two disparate worlds of East and West and the contradictions that arose from artistic exchange between them. The men wear breeches and doublets, whose style and cut generally conform to late sixteenth- and early seventeenth century European dress.1 Yet these Western garments, depicted with detailed embroidery, bear certain characteristic Chinese motifs: one man has a dragon design on his doublet, while another’s costume shows a typically Asian auspicious motif of intersecting diamonds within a diagonal lattice. In addition, the men’s features―including wispy mustaches and beards―have an Asian character. While the embroiderer may have intended to represent Portuguese gentlemen, there is a certain mixing of imagery and types here that is seen in other decorative arts of the period that depict foreigners, such as the painted Japanese Namban screens showing the ""barbarians"" arriving in Japan.2The basic design of the coverlet, which at some point was lined in a vibrant clamp resist-dyed silk from India (MMA 1975.208a-c), consists of a central roundel in a field surrounded by one or more borders; although this layout is frequently seen in works made for export, it also appears in domestic Chinese kang (daybed) covers.3 Its imagery―including dragons flanking a flaming jewel, the birds and flowers of the border, and the Chinese-style lions in each corner―is common in Chinese textiles. Some of the details, however, are unusual, or are combined in unexpected ways, suggesting the involvement of a European trader or client unfamiliar with the selection and placement of motifs in Chinese iconography. The jewel between the dragons, for example, is uniformly surrounded by flames, resembling a Western sun more than the characteristic Asian flaming jewel. And the lotus pond at one edge of the border, which would normally be the backdrop for pairs of waterfowl, such as ducks or egrets,? instead features large pheasants, more often depicted in a dry, rocky setting.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]Footnotes1.

"Panel with flowers, birds, and animals","Chinese, for export market",17th century,"This large rectangular textile with Chinese motifs and embroidery techniques is part of an important but little understood group of related works made in China for export.1 Described by various scholars as hangings, covers, or coverlets, all the textiles in the group share a common layout with a central roundel in a rectangular field, surrounded by multiple borders. This type of composition is often associated with the influence of Portuguese and Spanish models, although there are some earlier Asian examples that employ this format as well.2Wholly Asian in subject and style, however, are the motifs. The pair of phoenixes at the center of the textile encircle a large peony. Similar dynamically posed birds are also seen in an architectural stone relief excavated from the Yuan dynasty (1271C1368) capital and now in the National Museum of China, Beijing, as well as in a corresponding textile in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum,3 and peonies often figure in Ming rank badges, in which a pair of birds encircle a flower. Within the rectangular field are flowers and four more birds -- two golden pheasants and two peacocks, which were used as insignia for the second and third civil ranks in both Ming and Qing China.The multiple borders surrounding the central field include a wide border embroidered with various animals―rare creatures such as a tiger and elephant in addition to the familiar horse, deer, and goat, all of which are depicted side by side with such distinctively mythical Chinese beasts as a blue qilin and a white, singlehorned xiezhi. A composite animal with hooves and usually a single horn, the qilin is mentioned in poetry as early as the Han dynasty (206 b.c.Ca.d. 220),? its appearance was sometimes said to signal the birth of a sage, and it was used as a rank insignia for nobles. The xiezhi also appears in Han dynasty texts; known for its ability to distinguish virtue from evil, it used its sharp teeth and single horn to bite and gore wrongdoers, and it was the insignia for the censorate, which included judges. Here, both animals have flames shooting off their bodies, indicating their supernatural powers.Embroideries of this type were made for export, and a number have been preserved in Japan and Europe in historical contexts. The oldest documented example is an altar cloth in Saikyo￣ ji, a temple in Kyoto; it was donated in 1616.? Another example, now in the Museo Diocesano, Chiavari, Italy, was donated to a church in Chiavari in 1651 and used as a baldachin, or canopy, for the clergy.? Others are preserved in museum collections.?Chinese textiles and other goods came to the Americas via the Manila galleons’ annual trips between Acapulco (and Callao, the port city of Lima) and the Philippines. While to date no preserved embroideries from this group have been found in Mexico or Peru, their influence was present there by the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century,? as evident in the similar layout and motifs of a Peruvian tapestry in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (fig. 33).?[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1.

"Textile with elephants, crowned double headed eagles, and flowers","Chinese, Macao, for Iberian market",second half 16th century,"A symbol of exoticism and power, the Asian elephant (identified by its small ears) shares the visual space of this finely patterned silk satin damask with a European double-headed crowned eagle beneath a stylized, oval-shaped lotus.1 The elephant is shown with multiple tusks, three on one side and one peeking out on the other. As such, the animal seen here likely represents the Buddhist six-tusked elephant described in a fifth-century Chinese translation of a sutra as being resplendent and white and having lotuses, jade maidens, and other symbolic figures at the end of each tusk.2Elephants have a long history in China. Given as tribute to the emperor by local rulers, particularly from neighboring Southeast Asian regions where they were raised, elephants were also presented as diplomatic gifts to important foreign kings. Apart from their use as work animals and army transport, they were sometimes tamed to provide entertainment in times of leisure, beloved by the royal courts. In sixteenth-century Europe, elephants held a similar fascination for royals and commoners alike, and they appear in the works of such artists as Durer and Raphael. Shipped by boat from Ceylon to Lisbon, elephants were offered as gifts of the Portuguese kings to the courts of Spain, Austria, France, and England. In 1514, Manuel I of Portugal gave a white elephant (the famous ""Hanno"" known through Raphael's drawings) to Pope Leo X. An elephant given by the court of Lisbon to Philip II of Spain in 1581 was subsequently passed along to Henry IV of France. A year later Henry, in turn, gve it to Queen Elizabeth of England, a brillia;nt ""re-gifting"" of an asset deemed too expensive to maintain.3Here the combination of Buddhist symbols and Habsburg eagles produces a composite message of a religious and political nature that juxtaposes the two cultures of Asia and Europe. We do not know how long this long-preserved length of fabric was originally used, but its delicate quality indicates that it may have been part of a garment or hanging.?Woven in China and likely exported through the port of Macau, this textile's blend of Asian and European taste and style was intended for a foreign market that may not have understood the Buddhist elements but nonetheless would have appreciated the fine weaving and exotic designs.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]Footnotes1. The textile is composed of a five-harness satin damask, with a blue warp and yellow weft. The blue color is presumably indigo, while the yellow dye was made from the Asian pagoda tree (Sophora japonica). Dye analysis was conducted by Nobuko Shibayama in the Department of Scientific Research, Metropolitan Museum, with High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Photo Diode Array (HPLC-PDA).2. ""The creature is colossal . . . and is whiter than the snows of the Himalayas. At the ends of his six tusks are six bathing tanks, in each of which grow fourteen lotuses. On each open blossom is a ‘jade maiden’ fairer than the damsels of Paradise, in whose hands are five spontaneously created lutes; each lute is accompanied by 500 other musical instruments, and 500 jewel-colored birds."" Guan Puxian pu sa xing fa jing (Sutra on the Practice of Visualizing the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra), in Soper, ""Literary Evidence for Early Buddhist Art in China,"" p. 223.3. See Bedini, The Pope’s Elephant, Gschwend and Bellet, The Story of Suleyman, and Lach, ""The Elephant,"" pp. 152 ? 58.4. The panel comprises two widths of cloth seamed together: identical patterns that are somewhat mismatched at the join. A fragment of the white selvage with a blue stripe is preserved along the seam in two areas (visible at the back). Digby, ""Some Silks Woven under Portuguese Influence in the Far East,"" pp. 55 ? 56 and n. 11, notes that several Asian damasks from Macau have a white twill selvage with a stripe and that the structure of this selvage is distinct from other silks thought to be from Macau; the elephant silk conforms to the technical features of that group. Since we have little information as to the exact provenance of these textiles, technical features such as these can be important for identifying the potential locale of their production",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/mobile-large/DP267564.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/226463

Fan,probably Chinese,third quarter 18th century,"18th century fans have a sense of authenticity to them because they often depict contemporaneous life. The depiction of the costumes is detailed, and overall quality of the painting is refined, with a nuanced color palette. In the 19th century, good copies were made, and are sometimes difficult to distinguish. One interesting way to identify the 18th century fans, though, is by the color of the hair, which appears powdered gray rather than a natural color, which was the authentic style of the time, a nuance that the Victorians did not adopt in their copies.This fan is part of a large collection belonging to a Spanish Colonial family.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ci/mobile-large/52.166.54_front_CP4.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/156611

This bottle, Eastern in shape but Venetian in decorative style, must ow itse existence to this familiarity. It is a remarkable translation into the porcelain medium of the sixteenth-century vetro a fili technique: the incorporation into a clear glass matrix of blown rods―usually white, but sometimes colored―to produce a pattern of vertical or spiraling stripes.The bottle is one of only three known models of export porcelain that evoke glass techniques, but it would not have been copied directly from an Italian example since the shape does not occur until later. Venetian glass was widely imitated in northern Europe in the seventeenth century, and the bottle could have been copied from a Dutch glass adaptation of a Venetian model.

Grooms and horses,Zhao Mengfu,dated 1296 and 1359,"In the early Yuan period, when the ruling Mongols curtailed the employment of Chinese scholar-officials, the theme of the groom and horse―one associated with the legendary figure of Bole, whose ability to judge horses had become a metaphor for the recruitment of able government officials―became a symbolic plea for the proper use of scholarly talent. Zhao Mengfu painted this work for the high-ranking Surveillance Commissioner Feiqing, who may have been a government recruiter. Executed in early 1296, shortly after Zhao withdrew from civil service, the sensitively rendered groom may be a self-portrait.The striking geometry of the composition, made up of a series of prominent arcs in the figures of the horse and groom, and framed by the level ground line and vertical inscription, appears to have been constructed with a compass and square. The Chinese term ""compass-square"" (guiju) means ""regulation"" or ""order.""

Elegant Gathering in the Apricot Garden,Xie Huan,ca. 1437,"This handscroll is one of two similar compositions attributed to Xie Huan that document a gathering of nine scholar-officials in Beijing on April 6, 1437. The original composition, prepared for the party's host, Yang Rong (1371C1440), who is depicted wearing a red robe in the first group of seated figures, is now in the Zhenjiang Municipal Museum. This painting, probably made for the senior guest, Yang Shiqi (1365C1444), who is seated in a blue robe next to Yang Rong, is a condensed version executed by one of Xie Huan's associates. In spite of the apparent informality of the subject, the painting is carefully crafted to emphasize the power, prestige, and cultivation of the officials. The men's substantial robes and formal poses underscore the dignity of their positions, and their political ranks are distinguished by their placement in the composition. Those of the greatest status, Yang Shiqi and Yang Rong, are at the center of the composition; guests of lower rank are closer to the periphery of the scroll. The antiques and scholarly paraphernalia surrounding the men suggest their literary accomplishments and aesthetic discernment.Following the painting are poems composed by the participants to commemorate the gathering, beginning with a preface inscribed in a dignified clerical script by Yang Shiqi, the oldest participant and the highest-ranking government official of his day. The Qing official and later owner of the scroll Weng Tonghe (1830C1904) inscribed the mounting in front of the painting with a listing of the nine officials.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP273859_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41478

Bowl,China,Majiayao phase (ca. 3200C2650 BCE),"Pottery with painted decoration is among the most remarkable of the archaeological remains from Neolithic cultures that flourished along the banks of the Yellow River. One of China's earliest and most widespread, the Yangshao culture is divided into two branches: the nuclear Yangshao, located in Henan and Shaanxi provinces, and the subsequent Majiayao (or Gansu Yangshao), situated in Gansu and parts of Qinghai Province. Both branches are subdivided into six phases, named after specific archaeological sites, which share architectural forms, stone implements, and high-fired earthenware. However, the shapes and decorations of these ceramics vary, and earthenware from the northwest is distinguished from that of earlier periods by the complexity and density of the designs. The flowing curvilinear forms painted on this shallow basin typify ceramics associated with the Majiayao phase.

"Carved fan, blossoming roses and excerpt from the Commentary on the Water Classic",Jin Xiya,1933 (bamboo carving); 1934 (fan calligraphy); 1935 (fan painting),"This work captures a subtle sense of humor of Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. One of the outer ribs depicts a group of foods that ripen with the approach of summer. This subject, known as jianchun, literally, “a farewell meal to spring,” is a common literati theme. In addition to the normal seasonal vegetables and fruits of this season―bamboo shoots and cherries―the artist has inserted a pufferfish (hetun, fugu in Japanese). Consuming these fish can be lethal without professional preparation, but it is a famous delicacy in both China and Japan. The unconventional addition of this fish was undoubtedly intended as a playful surprise! Jin’s archive records that this folding fan was a gift to his teenage daughter, which may explain why such an amusing and personal design was selected.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (fan frame #191), the bamboo carving of spider and bamboo was completed on November 5, 1933, and the carving of spring foods was completed on December 21, 1933.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-20120-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/839232

Joint Landscape,Shen Zhou,ca. 1509 and 1546,"Shen Zhou, the quintessential Ming scholar-amateur painter, preferred to live in retirement rather than risk the vicissitudes of government service. He devoted much of his later life to an exploration of the brush style of the fourteenth-century recluse-painter Wu Zhen. Shen's painting epitomizes the scholar-amateur tradition of self-expression; by depicting the interior world of the mind and heart, it embodies the essence of Chinese artistic striving. The painting's imagery is about private places: secluded dwellings hidden in the heart of the landscape. Shen's calligraphic brushwork, like handwriting, subtly conveys the writer's mind and personality. Shen's most ambitious landscape composition―the scroll is over fifty-six feet long―it shows the artist systematically reinterpreting Wu Zhen's brush idiom while striving for a new compositional monumentality.The painting remained incomplete at Shen Zhou's death. In 1546 it was rediscovered by Shen's illustrious pupil Wen Zhengming, who added finishing touches. Wen's inscription recounts: ""The composition was already fully realized, but the dotting and washing had not been completed. I, his student, have now finished it.

Joint calligraphy,Huang Daozhou,dated 1632,"This scroll is a testament to the early friendship and mutual admiration of the two men, both of whom earned their ""presented scholar"" (jinshi) degrees in 1622 and went on to become outspoken exponents of political reform. It opens with a playful description by Huang of the similarities between the two friends' calligraphy. He states that he did not arrive at a style of his own until he studied Ni's writing, but he also recounts how Ni had made the same claim about Huang's influence on his calligraphy. Huang ends by remarking that after Ni became a high official, it was nearly impossible to obtain a piece of calligraphy from him. Ni Yuanlu's response, appended to the same length of satin, takes an equally sarcastic tone.

Early Autumn after Qian Xuan,Yu Jingzhi,Dated 1938,"Yu Jingzhi is one of the best-known female artists to practice traditional Chinese painting in the first half of the twentieth century. Born in Hangzhou, she became familiar with the highly descriptive local tradition of academic painting based on the court art of the Southern Song dynasty (1127C1279). She moved to New York in 1936, and held several one-person shows in New York, Boston, and Chicago through the 1960s. This work is a meticulous monochrome copy of Early Autumn, a handscroll in the Detroit Institute of Arts that bears a signature of the early Yuan (1279C1368) master Qian Xuan (ca. 1235Cbefore 1307). Depicting an autumnal lotus pond abuzz with lively inhabitants, the painting juxtaposes life and decay to convey the transient nature of all living things. Zhang Daqian wrote a frontispiece in his striking calligraphy. Lin Yutang contributed a colophon that reads:[Yu] Jingzhi, a female scholar and artist, is descended from a highly cultured family. Though living in the United States for many years, she has never abandoned her former practice. She gave me her copy of Shunju's [Qian Xuan's] painting. It truly captures the feeling that insects, plants, and other myriad creatures all live their lives to the full, even though they are ephemerae between heaven and earth just like me.

Symbolically, the animals comprise a rebus, a visual pun in which a phrase is spelled out using pictures. In Chinese, the phrase “three gibbons capture egrets” (san yuan de lu) may also be read as “a triple first gains power,” a wish for success in the three levels of the imperial examinations. Originally mounted as a fan, this exquisite painting would have been the perfect gift for an aspiring scholar preparing for the exams.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153503.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40071

Here, it also features a Chinese cloud border and flawlessly rendered versions of the Chinese character for longevity (shou) in the center of and atop each one.

It belongs to a small group of closely related saddles that may stem from a single workshop or reflect a specific type developed in one region. Notable features are the lively dragons, chiseled free from the scrollwork ground, and the unusual decorative technique involving silver damascening of the entire surfaces of the saddle plates, with select design elements highlighted by mercury gilding over the silver. Also very distinctive is the use of three layers of decoration: the outer layer of pierced scrollwork with long tendrils deeply undercut to give an appearance of depth, a second layer forming a subsidiary ground underlying each saddle plate and consisting of an iron grill damascened in silver to create a stylized cloud pattern, and a layer of colored cloth directly on top of the wood of the saddle-tree.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/DP113274.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/26656

Inspired by Li Cheng's (919C967) descriptive idiom of jagged rock formations and spiky ""crab-claw"" wintry trees, which demand representational skill as well as calligraphic discipline, Wang's perfectly controlled lyrical composition―a snowscape of enchanted stillness-celebrates the beauty of nature.Painted for Zhou Lianggong (1612C1672), a high-ranking official who was facing unjust charges of corruption, Wang's choice of the Li Cheng style was significant. Li's winter landscapes had long been viewed as emblems of survival in the face of adversity, so Wang's painting may be read as an expression of sympathy and encouragement.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36810-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40021

Three years later, Wang Shimin made his own album in response, painted in a broader style suited to his failing vision.

That was forty years ago; now I am eighty-three. The master’s grandson Qiuya has taken this out to show me.

A zahua album is meant to delight the viewer with variety, as a new subject appears with each turn of the page.The paintings may have been brought together into an album by a collector at a later date, or even perhaps by Chen Zi himself.

It was through Boerdu that Shitao contributed to this joint work with the preeminent painter Wang Hui, who left his inscription on the rock.

In making his copy, the artist chose the “plain-drawing” (baimiao) style of Li Gonglin (ca. 1049C1106), whose nephew commissioned the work in 1140. Concentrating on line, the painter eliminated the colors found in the original. Figures are drawn in the type of strongly calligraphic line admiringly characterized by Song critics as “iron wire.” In this style, the brush tip is kept at the center of the brushstroke to create taut fluid lines.The twelfth-century painting was later divided into four sections.

Travelers in a Wintry Forest,Unidentified artist,early 12th century,"During the tenth and eleventh centuries, majestic trees rivaled panoramic landscapes as sources of artistic inspiration.

The scene is a microcosm of the natural cycle of growth and decay, with the great pine, symbolizing the virtuous gentleman, surrounded by trees ranging from youthful saplings to a shattered ancient hulk. The stoic silence of the wintry forest is matched by the unyielding spirit of the scholar on his donkey―the noble recluse who has entered the mountains to rediscover in nature the moral order that is lost in the human world.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP154079.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40003

The Four Seasons,Unidentified artist,15th century,"The theme of this painting is the progress of the seasons from spring to winter. The scroll begins with a scene of jagged peaks and mist-filled valleys: trees are tinged with the delicate red of new leaf buds and blossoms; turbulent mountain streams suggest the melting snow of early spring. The composition next opens into a broad vista of a lake whipped by a summer rainstorm. Autumn, with its clear skies, is a time for climbing, and the perspective shifts to high mountains with a view across distant pinnacles. In the final scene, wintry sky and water appear dark against snow-covered mountains, where only the pine and bamboo remain green.In its combination of eclectic Northern and Southern Song compositional elements and brush techniques, this landscape belongs to the revival of Song styles patronized by the conservative early Ming court. Kept alive during the fourteenth century by such artists as Tang Di (ca. 1296C1364), this style gained new prominence during the early fifteenth century in the hands of such artists as Dai Jin, Zhou Wenjing, and Li Zai.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP205315_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45673
A Summer Idyll,Unidentified artist,15thC16th century,"This work and another in the Xinxiang County Museum, Henan Province, are the only known calligraphic hanging scrolls associated with Zhao Mengfu. In both works,the large cursive script, written in a bold dry-brush, ""flying-white"" technique, and the loose structure of individual characters suggest a Ming-dynasty date.The poem, which is recorded in Zhao's collected works, is the first in a series of three entitled ""Three Quatrains on Some Immediate Events."" It describes the leisurely life of the artist in early summer:Through the loosely woven bamboo curtainfrom Xiang, I see a sparse wavy pattern.In my newly tailored white sackcloth gown,gentle heat rises.The shadow of the sun over the courtyardgrows longer, and visitors stay away.About the pond the grass is fragrant,and swallows fly in pairs.(trans.

Landscape in the style of Fan Kuan,Unidentified artist,early 12th century,"Once considered a work of the Ming period (1368C1644), this monumental landscape in the style of Fan Kuan can be dated stylistically to the twelfth century. A mountainscape built up in three stages, the painting shows a boat landing at the foot of a tree-covered bluff in the foreground; travelers heading toward a temple retreat in the middle ground; and mountain peaks rising in the background. The composition, showing mountain masses floating amid and unified by mist, compares closely to works firmly dated to the twelfth century. For example, the depiction of rocks and trees partially obliterated by mist and the blurring and fusing of texture strokes of different ink values reveal the artist’s familiarity with the paintings of Guo Xi (ca. 1000Cca. 1090). The angular rock faces with “raindrop” texture dots and the scrubby foliage on the peaks are characteristic of paintings in the style of Fan Kuan.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP165244.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40002

Chessmen (32),Chinese,19th century,"The white king portrays Napoleon, easily recognized by his posture and costume. His queen, however, cannot be identified as Josephine or Marie-Louise, and her dress is at least semi-Oriental. In many Chinese sets for export the likeness of the king is that of a well-known character, but the likeness does not extend to his consort. The opposing, Chinese, ruler is not recognizable, as is customary. The white bishop is evidently meant to be such; a Chinese sage is his opponent. Apart from these capital pieces there is considerable confusion. The four knights are the same shape, differentiated only by color; so are the rooks (elephants with castles). Somewhat archaistic in view of Napoleon's presence, the pawns are pikemen on the Chinese side, and their opponents carry swords and round shields, echoing some of the figures of Indian export sets. The set was undoubtedly made for French consumption, as the Chinese varied the nationality of the king to suit the allegiance of their visitors.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/210660

Tiger Hill,Lu Zhi,datable to 1550s,"Artists in sixteenth-century Suzhou often painted the scenic sites of their hometown. Such paintings were intended to celebrate the beauty of Suzhou―it was then, as now, one of the most beautiful cities in the world―but also to highlight the layers of historical and religious significance that made these places famous. This intimate painting depicts Tiger Hill, a destination northwest of the city that was the frequent subject of poems and paintings by local literati who traveled there in search of inspiration and relaxation. Lu Zhi, one of the leading scholar-painters of his day, used his signature technique of layering angular brushstrokes to build up mountain forms, creating an almost cubist effect. The long colophon is a set of poems about Tiger Hill by the Song-dynasty poet Jiang Tang (980C1054), here transcribed by the scholar Xu Weiren (1788C1855).",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/904714

Duke Wen of Jin Recovering His State,Li Tang,mid-12th century,"This handscroll tells the story of the exile and return to power of Chonger, duke of the ancient state of Jin. Driven from his home by a succession crisis, Chonger spent nineteen years in exile seeking support from other states before returning in triumph to assume the title Duke of Jin in 636 BCE. Though unsigned, the painting has long been attributed to the court painter Li Tang, who served in both the Northern and Southern Song painting academies. The calligraphy, executed in the style of Emperor Gaozong, was probably written by a scribe on his behalf.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP152403_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40051
Stag Hunt,Huang Zongdao,未知年代,"As he hits his prey, the hunter on his pony is ready with a second arrow in his left hand. The powerful horse is shown in an animated “flying gallop,” with bulging muscles suggesting the frenzied excitement of the chase, while the delicately rendered deer presents a moving portrait of a gentle victim and death.Hunting was an ancient aristocratic pastime, especially favored as a pictorial theme by the naturalized nomad painter Prince Li Zanhua, to whom this painting was once attributed. By the late Northern Song period, scholar-critics had begun to treat the hunting scene as an allegory of violence and greed. Both the painting style and the psychological interpretation of the subject matter suggest an early-twelfth-century date for this work.An unusually fine collection of colophons is attached to the scroll. In 1352 Zhu Derun (1294C1365) attributed the painting to Li Zanhua. Three other fourteenth-century colophons are followed by a poem by the great Suzhou painter Shen Zhou (1427C1509). The senselessness of violence, as portrayed by the hunt, is lamented by all the colophon writers",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP204851_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39938
Quatrain on fishermen,Emperor Gaozong,12th century,"Following his abdication in 1162, Gaozong lived another twenty-five years in retirement with his wife, the empress Wu (1115C1197), devoting himself to scholarly and artistic pursuits. This poem, written in running script, may be a late work. The poem embellishes a round silk fan, a favored new format in Southern Song imperial art. By the late twelfth century, all silk fans were embellished with a painting on one side and a poem on the other, the image and the words complementing each other. The retired emperor often inscribed fans to bestow as gifts. The poems, when not original works by the emperor, were taken from anthologies of Tang or early Song poetry.This poem, describes the life of the fisherman-recluse:Small fishing boats are moored along the sandbanks of a stream.Calling to one another, the boatmen have gone to the wine-house.Turning in their catch of perch to buy drink,They retire to the song of the oars, to sleep in the rosy mist.(Wen C.

Illustration of Su Shi’s “Second Rhapsody on Red Cliff”,Unidentified artist,late 14thCearly 15th century,"The subject and style of this fan painting exemplify late Yuan scholarly taste. The picture illustrates the celebrated ""Second Ode on the Red Cliff"" by the Northern Song scholar-artist Su Shi (1036C1101), in which a poet dreams that a crane he saw during an outing was a Daoist immortal in disguise. The rough brush idiom is based on the traditions of Dong Yuan (act. ca. 940C75) and Juran (act. ca. 960C95), but the patterned texture strokes, moss dots, and brisk rhythmic arcs of the water reeds recall the fourteenth-century master Sheng Mou.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153533.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44451

Bodhisattva (Maitreya) with crossed ankles,China,ca. 470C80,"This statue is most likely the Bodhisattva Maitreya. The closest examples are the Maitreya statues in Caves 5 and 25 (?) at Yungang, Shanxi Province. An early example is the Maitreya in Cave 275 at Dunhuang, which dates to early fifth century. All these statues share the same attributes, a seated posture with crossed legs, a crown with a Buddha image, and the right hand held upright with the palm facing forward in a gesture of allaying fears (abhaya mudra).The representation of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin) in Chinese Buddhist art first appeared in the late fourth century. By the late sixth century, it had assumed its standard image, characterized by the water flask and lotus stem, or willow branch, in his hand, and sometimes an image of the Buddha on his crown, which, at Yungang, was on the crown of Maitreya instead.At an early stage of its development, Avalokiteshvara was often depicted as an attendant of Maitreya, as is seen in the Maitreya mural at Bingling Temple in Tianshui, Gansu, which dates to the early fifth century. It was not represented by itself until the late sixth century, when the worship of Avalokiteshvara gradually gained popularity.More investigation is needed to confirm Cave 25 to be the original locus, as proposed on the catalogue card. In their seminal work on Yungang, Sekino and Tokiwa list 20 caves that range from late fourth to late fifth or early sixth century. They didn’t mention Cave 25, which is little recorded in Chinese sources.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP170134.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42711

Artificial Rock #10,Zhan Wang,2001,"The strangely eroded rocks long revered by Chinese scholars were typically formed through geologic processes. Connoisseurs appreciated these natural sculptures for many of the same reasons they admired calligraphy: the sense of dynamic form, energy, and the interplay of positive and negative space. Artisans also produced facsimiles of naturally occurring rocks in various materials, including jade, glass, and ceramic. Zhan extends this tradition into the present day by recreating a scholar’s rock in an industrial medium. He began by molding sheets of stainless steel around the surface of a traditional Chinese scholar’s rock, then removed these sheets, welded them together, and burnished the surface until the seams disappeared. The resulting work challenges us to redefine the parameters of tradition and to ask how tradition sustains itself by evolving in the contemporary world.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP158804.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73294

Li was also the first Chinese artist to explore modern woodcut techniques, introducing graphics into Chinese newspapers and stressing the importance of teaching commercial art. Disillusioned by the corruption and chaos he saw around him, Li became a Buddhist monk in 1918.

"Twin Pines, Level Distance",Zhao Mengfu,ca. 1310,"This spare, enigmatic scene represents a revolutionary redirection in Chinese painting. Zhao Mengfu reduces his ""painted"" landscape to a set of calligraphic brush conventions, with the rocks executed in ""flying-white"" cursive and the pines outlined in unmodulated seal script. He thus rejects illusionistic representation and relies instead on expressive brush lines to imbue his imagery with personal meaning.Zhao underscores his commitment to this new approach by adding a title to the right of his pines and writing a long inscription on top of the distant mountains at the left side of the composition, making it clear that his painting is not merely about landscape scenery.Despite his adherence to this new style, Zhao chooses a traditionally significant subject. In Chinese art, pine trees have long been emblems of survival.

Lotus,Pan Tianshou,dated 1945,"After teaching painting and art history in Shanghai in the early 20s, Pan Tianshou went to Japan to study new pedagogical methods. He returned convinced that the salvation of Chinese painting lay in serving its own principles, not the techniques and media of foreign ateliers. Writing in 1926, he attributed the interest Chinese painters had in modern European painting to increasing tendencies in the West toward Chinese purity of line and color and ""spiritual taste"". He opposed the New Culture Movement of the 30s, and his paintings are the most compelling argument for his case that Chinese tradition offers the means for a truly modern Chinese style. They reflect his study of the carved-line calligraphic scripts; he shows himself rooted firmly in the lineage of Zhao Zhiqian and Wu Changshuo, the latter a friend in Shanghai. The boldness and emotional intensity of his work belong wholly to the 20th century.The poem that accompanies this painting reads:The glistening dewdrops have formed on the jade screen.Reflection from the resplendent lotus turns the leaves to read.Liulang [the lotus] is so dissolute when drunk.who put him into the green tent?[Trans.

Dream of China,Wang Jin,2008,"Wang Jin’s Dream of China reproduces a traditional Chinese dragon robe in the Qing dynasty court style using the industrial materials PVC and nylon fishing thread. The embroidered waves, clouds, and dragons tint the translucent robe with green hues. Suspended rigidly by an iron chain, with the sleeves outstretched as if supported by invisible limbs, the robe appears hauntingly ethereal. Its weightless presence belies the elaborate production process that typically involves several skilled embroiders.Wang dismantles the imperial prestige and power normally associated with the dragon robe and transforms it into something quaint and elusive. As the title implies, the artist imbues the iconic imagery with new meanings and critiques in response to the consumerism and industrialization that has spread across China since the early 1990s.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP280367.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77805

The Two Purities,Wu Changshuo,1922,"With slashing stokes of jet-black ink, Wu Changshuo depicted the “two purities”―pine and plum blossom―as expressive, nearly abstract marks set against the faint gray wash of a garden rock.

Heavenly Horse,Xu Beihong,dated 1942,"All his life, Xu Beihong championed the revitalization of Chinese painting through an integration of Western-style realism and Chinese brush techniques. Here, using sharp tonal contrasts of ink and white paper, Xu's swift rendition of this noble steed embodies the spirit of a traditional ""ink play."" The horse's naturalistic pose is deftly captured in abbreviated brushwork. The chiaroscuro modeling of its form is more subjective than scientific, but the horse's accurate anatomy and the convincing foreshortening of its body reflect Xu's solid grounding in Western academic art. The hauteur of the unleashed, unmounted animal isessentially Western in character, whereas its mane and tail, blowing unnaturally in opposite directions, attests to the artist's ultimately subjective (Chinese) approach.Xu's passionate images of horses, a traditional symbol of Chinese martial spirit, were intended to inspire patriotic resistance during the Sino-Japanese War (1937C45). Here, for example, the artist reveals his own sense of frustration by adding a poem by Du Fu (712C770) that describes a famous breed of war horses that had been put to pasture because of their old age despite their continued willingness to fight:Nanshi [in Gansu province] is a congenial habitat for heavenly horses;Tens of thousands of them are always stalwart.Floating clouds expand across the vast frontier;Autumn grasses grow tall over the mountains.I have heard that the pure bloodline of dragon-horsesLives on in the aging Sushuang horse.Neighing sadly longing to fight,It stands tall facing the sky.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-29413-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72778

Together with the capture of the Luding Bridge, this achievement enabled Mao’s troops to continue their northward retreat toward Yan’an in Shaanxi Province. The political message of struggling against all odds is also applicable to Fu’s effort to find new ways of negotiating Chinese painting under the changed political order.

Forts Zeelandia and Provintia and the City of Tainan,Unidentified artist,19th century,"This pictorial map depicts the Taiwanese coastal town of Tainan, where the Dutch built two forts around 1624, remnants of which still survive today. In addition to showcasing the European-style forts with their distinctive masonry architecture, the painting records a wealth of other details, including Chinese-style walled towns, farmhouses on stilts, and numerous vignettes of dailym life featuring both people in Chinese dress and half-naked indigenous people.Several versions of this composition―all painted on deerskin―are extant. Although each of the versions is somewhat different, the use of stamps or stencils to reproduce many of the pictorial elements suggests that, like Chinese painted wallpapers, it was created in a workshop for the Western market. While a precise date for the map's creation is difficult to pinpoint, the absence of foreign ships or figures indicates that the composition postdates the departure of the Dutch in 1662, and the presence of a city wall, which was not built until 1791, suggests that the painting, acquired at auction from a German collection in 1909, probably dates to the nineteenth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP354272.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/35968

Most of the male figures are variations of Li’s self-portrait, wearing costumes that range from a pink pig suit to the robe of an ancient Chinese scholar, and expressions that vary from drowsy drunkenness to beatific calm.

Seated Woman,Lin Fengmian,late 1970s,"Lin Fengmian was one of the first Chinese artists to study in Europe. In 1919 he traveled to France, where he was attracted to the strong colors and semiabstract forms of the Impressionists and the Fauves. When Lin returned to China in 1926, he was appointed principal of the Beijing Art Academy, but his radical views on art alarmed conservatives. He soon left and founded an art academy in Hangzhou that became the locus for study of modern Western art in China before the war.The reorganization of the Hangzhou Academy after the founding of the People's Republic left Lin without a post. He moved to Shanghai and from 1949 to 1977 painted in virtual isolation, stubbornly resisting a Social Realist style. During the Cultural Revolution he was accused of spying and was jailed. In 1977 Lin was granted a leave to visit relatives in Hong Kong; he lived there until his death.Early in his career Lin abandoned oils for Chinese brush and gouache on paper in order to capture a sense of spontaneity―an intention that approached the traditional ideals of the Chinese literati painter.

Bodhidharma crossing the Yangzi River on a reed,Li Yaofu,before 1317,"Bodhidharma was the legendary Indian patriarch who brought Chan Buddhism to China. After an unsuccessful audience with the Chinese emperor Liang Wudi (r. 502C49), Bodhidharma “broke off a reed, crossed the Yangzi River, and proceeded to the Shaolin Temple [on Mount Song in Henan Province].”This painting is signed by Li Yaofu, whose name appears only in Japanese records, and is inscribed by Yishan Yining, the renowned Chinese missionary who went in 1299 to Japan. There, Yishan served as abbot of temples in Kamakura and Kyoto until his death. The inscription reads:Crossing rivers and deserts he came.Facing the emperor he confessed, “I don’t know”;Unsuccessful, he moved on,His feet treading the water.While mainstream painters followed the style of Li Gonglin (ca. 1049C1106)―that of baimiao, or “white drawing,” executed with a controlled line of uniform thickness―the Chan painter employed a more flexible brush style that combined fine lines with graduated ink-wash strokes in a free expressive manner.

At first glance, Li’s grids seem impenetrable, a mass of lines woven together like a textile. Viewed at close range, they pulsate with emotion and expressiveness, as every shift in the artist’s energy and concentration is recorded on the page. The modernist visual language of the grid is merged with the idea of brushwork as a window into the artist’s spirit, which Li adopted from premodern Chinese painting.

Lotus,Guo Dawei,ca. 1960C65,"Guo Dawei dedicated this painting to Lin Yutang and his wife. It chronicles the life cycle of the lotus. At the center is a flower in full bloom.

Although Guo painted lotus often, compositions with a distinct temporal dimension like this one are rare.The distinctive pink color of the lotus―namely, ""Western red"" in Chinese―was first imported into China from Mexico in the early twentieth century and became widely used in traditional painting. The sinuous lotus stems cutting across the picture surface are calligraphic lines that create a shallow space through overlapping and contrasting tonality.

The Culture Peddler,Zhang Ju,1930s and 1940s,"The Modern Woodcut Movement is an important but understudied chapter in the history of twentieth-century Chinese art. The movement was initiated by Lu Xun (1881C1936), the father of modern Chinese literature and an incisive cultural critic, who saw woodcut as the ideal medium for rousing what he saw as a complacent China from its slumber to face up to the challenges of the modern world. Easily produced from inexpensive materials and with relatively limited training, woodcut was seen as a counterpoint to the precious erudition of literati landscape painting. The medium was used extensively during the 1930s and ‘40s―by both Communist and Nationalist leaders―to disseminate political messages in a graphically impactful, legible form. Some of the most iconic vignettes from the War of Resistance (against Japan, 1937C45) and the Chinese Civil War (1945C49) were produced in this medium.

Hermit Playing the Qin,Wang Zhen,dated 1914,"The year 1919 was an important one in the political fate of the new Chinese Republic. The Treaty of Versailles ending World War I transferred all former German possessions in China to Japan, rather than satisfy Chinese demands for sovereignty and the nullification of foreign privileges in China. On May 4, 1919, students led protest riots in Peking against this blow to Chinese national pride. By June, the focus of protest had moved to Shanghai, where Wang Zhen lived. The May Fourth Movement led to a democratization of Chinese culture, particularly in the use of the vernacular language in literature. New ideas, including socialism, communism, anarchism, pragmatism and women's liberation flashed among the urban populations.In this climate of political and cultural change, Wang Zhen's painting of the spring of 1920 is particularly poignant. It is a painting of reclusion. The robe-clad figure faces away, lost in contemplation of mists and a ""waterfall that splashes like pearls."" The image of a paradise, whether a Buddhist Pure Land or the Peach Blossom Spring of China's literary history, appears in several paintings on view in this exhibition.

Li Keran, unlike many contemporary artists is a calligrapher as well as a painter, and his study of Six Dynasties stone inscriptions gives his brush strokes a vigor that distinguishes his style.In this painting, Li's interest in drawing real landscapes if confirmed.

Brewing Tea,Wu Changshuo,dated 1918,"Wu Changshuo created a distinctive style that fused the classical epigraphic approach to painting with the popular style of Ren Yi (1840C1895) and continued the literati ideal of uniting poetry, calligraphy, and painting in a single work of art.Wu's image of a scholar seated beside a qin (zither) savoring freshly brewed tea celebrates the timeless literati ideals of refinement, withdrawal, and self-cultivation. Wu chose a traditional subject and blunt calligraphic brushwork when many artists were turning to the West for subject matter and style, reflecting his belief in the Chinese tradition as an enduring resource for the modern artist. Wu's poem reads:Watching the bubbling spring water,Sitting beside the stony edge of the lake,Old pines resemble ancient sages,A qin lies by a man from the past.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H.

Vase,China,1713C22,"Lush pinkish-red glazes, such as the “peach bloom” on this small vase, were first produced in the third quarter of the seventeenth century. Small vases in this shape have long been thought to belong to sets of eight or more accoutrements designed for a writing table. This is one of four vases, each with a subtly different shape, that were found among a set of implements. It is distinguished from the others by the three thin rings at the base of the neck. These sets, which may or may not actually have been used, were most likely intended for presentation as gifts to officials working at the court. As is often the case with works produced for the court, a six-character inscription on the base indicates that it was made during the reign of the Kangxi emperor (Da Qing Kangxi nian zhi).

In Beijing, where he lived for many years, he was active as a teacher as well as an artist. This work dates to that period of his life.The painting features a powerfully posturing pine. A moss-covered rock, leaning to the left, offers a counter-thrust to the rightward leaning tree. In Chinese culture, the pine is revered as the gentleman of trees.

On Man and Nature,Lin Yutang,dated 1971C1972,"Lin Yutang wrote this piece for his son-in-law Li Ming (Richard Lai). It begins with a transcription of a passage from the essay ""On Nature"" by Xunzi (Xun Qing, 340C245 B.C.), one of the twin pillars of early Confucianism. After the quotation, Lin offers his own comment on Xunzi's idea. In his essay, Xunzi took pains to refute the rival theory of the ""unity of man and nature"" that was to dominate Chinese thought for the next two millennia. Lin Yutang notes that this is the only place in the history of Chinese philosophy where the notion of mankind overcoming nature for its own benefit is so strongly articulated. He also sees in Xunzi's words a parallel to the Western scientific and utilitarian approach to nature, and, for once in his life, champions the Western attitude toward nature as a material resource to be exploited. instead of regarding Nature as great and admiring it, why not foster it as a thing and regulate it? Instead of obeying Nature and singing its praise, why not control the Mandate of Nature and use it? Instead of watching the seasons and waiting for them, why not respond to them and make use of them? Instead of letting things multiply by themselves, why not exercise your abilityto transform [and increase] them?(trans. by Wing-tsit Chan, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1963], p. 122)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP146973.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72790

Returning to Nature through a Reclusive Life,Yu Peng,dated 1996,"Yu Peng belongs to the first generation of artists born in Taiwan after the Nationalist government reestablished itself on the island in 1949, and his art, like that of many of his contemporaries, often addresses the politically fraught issue of cultural identity in Taiwan. Yu lives in Taipei but has asserted his mainland Chinese heritage by naming his residence the Pingyang Studio, after his ancestral hometown in Hebei Province. In exploring the legacy of his historic homeland, he has constructed his own interpretation of a ""literati"" way of life. Adopting an approach that is both whimsical and satirical, Yu selectively evokes the ways of the ancients while simultaneously acknowledging the blend of nostalgia and modern, middle-class taste prevalent in metropolitan Taipei after its rapid economic growth during the 1980s and 1990s.Employing a traditional medium and format, Yu divided his composition roughly into thirds. The central section is dominated by a red ground, where a figure dressed to resemble a scholargentleman is seated. He is surrounded by ten mannequin-like figures and backed by a painted screen―elements that may allude to the artist's interest in shadow puppet theater. The crowded lower third of the painting presents a fantastical garden bustling with curious figures and objects associated with Chinese antiquity.

Poem Written in the Style of the Haotaiwang Stele,Feng Kanghou,dated 1972,"Feng Kanghou, a native of Guangdong Province, was an outstanding seal-carver and calligrapher. In this work, dedicated to Li Ming (Richard Lai), he composed a quatrain with characters collected from an ancient stele commemorating Kwanggaet'o-daewang (r. 391C412)―Haotaiwang in Chinese―the nineteenth king of the Koguryo state that occupied the northern portion of the Korean peninsula and parts of Manchuria from 37 B.C. to A.D. 668. This monument was erected near the Koguryo capital of Kungnaesong (in present-day Ji'an, Jilin province) in 414. After this area fell under Chinese rule in 668, the stele sank into oblivion. Its accidental rediscovery in 1877 marked a major find in the avid search for ancient steles in nineteenth- and early-twentieth- century China. As Feng notes here, ""The calligraphy of the Haotaiwang Stele, while simple and unpolished, emanates antique exuberance. However bold and free, it retains the discipline of clerical script."" Following convention, Feng Kanghou transcribed his poem by faithfully duplicating the forms of carved characters. However, his transcription shows its own idiosyncratic features. Feng sought to evoke the archaic flair of his model by intentionally simulating the damage or wear to the stele as well as the crude craftsmanship of its carver by making some of his lines crooked or uneven. Feng's poem reads:My home in a stretch of hills by the distant waterIs said to be the place of eternal joy and peace.What people have loved from ancient times to the present is all here.Mountains and lakes are such delights.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-29420-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72797
The True Story of Ah Q,Zhao Yannian,1980,"The True Story of Ah Q by the revolutionary writer Lu Xun (1881C1936) is bitterly ironic. The fictional Ah Q lived through the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 and the early years of the Republic. Paradoxically a bully and a coward, he epitomizes the seriously flawed Chinese character. Mindlessly following others through a life of misery, defiance, and self-delusion, he eventually brings about his own execution.Zhao Yannian’s series of sixty woodblock-printed illustrations of this story is considered his masterpiece. Redolent of European Expressionism, Zhao’s prints focus attention on Lu Xun’s antihero by creating strong contrasts with the “black against white” and “white against black” techniques.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/PI_104.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77145

Camellia and Butterflies,Guo Weiqu,undated,"Guo Weiqu learned both Chinese and Western painting in his youth. Although his later work in Chinese media barely reveals any Western influences, his training in Western art was crucial in liberating him from the restraints of traditional art practice and contributed to his innovative approach of blending different genres and contrasting styles. Reaching artistic maturity in the late 1950s, Guo's upbeat eclecticism conveys the optimistic, progressive ethos of the New China under Communist leadership.Guo considered composition the key to a successful work, and the most important compositional concern in flower-and-bird painting, in his opinion, was to build momentum. He shunned calligraphic brushstrokes in favor of series of short, rhythmic lines to shape forms.Far from precise or concrete, the contours of his subjects tend to blur, evoking motion and change.Like many artists of his generation, Guo Weiqu sought to serve the national cause through his art. Even after the persecution he suffered during the Cultural Revolution severely crippled his health, he remained true to Communist ideology. The frequent reference to the morning sun in his inscriptions, therefore, may carry a political meaning, since it was a common symbol of Communist China and Chairman Mao. The inscription reads:The morning sun enters my window, rising among trees fresh and moist.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-29282-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72787
The Pavilion of Prince Teng,Tang Di,dated 1352,"The Pavilion of Prince Teng demonstrates that Tang Di, a scholar and government official best known for his large-scale colored paintings on silk, was also capable of producing intimate, more informal ink drawings on paper. As he does in his monumental decorative style, Tang here follows the conservative brush idiom of the Northern Song master Guo Xi (ca. 1000Cca. 1090), though his relaxed calligraphic depiction of rocks, trees, and foliage reflects the early Yuan transformation of Song models by Tang Di's teacher, Zhao Mengfu (1254C1322). The pavilion, erected in the seventh century by the prince of Teng, is one of the most renowned buildings in Chinese history, thanks to the poet Wang Bo (649C676). It is situated near the confluence of the Gan and Yangzi Rivers in Jiangsi Province. Wang's poem, which contrasts the impermanence of human life with the endless flow of the river, has made the pavilion a favorite subject for painters. The large seals at the beginning of this scroll belong to Prince Yi (1686C1730), thirteenth son of the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662C1722).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP205767_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40134
Shrimp,Qi Baishi,dated 1927,"Qi Baishi's early mentor in Beijing, Chen Hengke (1876C1923), counseled him to abandon his technical training and strive for a new expressive freedom through a calligraphic approach to painting. The subsequent transformation of Qi's style is illustrated by this painting. Each crustacean―like a single Chinese character―is formed through the repetition of the same conventionalized pattern of marks. Released from the need to visualize each shrimp separately, Qi thus was free to explore the abstract expressive possibilities of structure, ink tone, and composition and to achieve the direct, childlike spontaneity and naturalness that are hallmarks of his work. Qi's exhilaration at the possibilities offered by this method are reflected in his inscription:If you can forget painting theory, you will not suffer from its deeply rooted bad effects. Then your brush will fly like the heavenly horse moving through the sky.(Robert H. Ellsworth et al., trans., Later Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 1800-1950, 3 vols.

Flying Magpie,Xu Beihong,dated 1942,"This painting captures a magpie in midflight; its spreading wings and half-extended feet suggest that it has just taken off or is about to land. The delicate whips of a willow form a minimal backdrop. Their arcing lines imply a breeze behind the bird's forward motion. Although the austere simplicity of this composition is characteristic of the literati tradition of Chinese painting, the rendering of the magpie's plumage is free of the calligraphic brush idioms of traditional scholar-painters.

Monk Gazing at Clouds,Su Renshan,未知年代,"Here, Su Renshan exploited the linear patterns and graphic forms found in woodblock prints―one of his principal sources of inspiration―to create a startlingly minimalist style. His economical drawing, more sketch than painting, conveys the artist's hand with great immediacy, but Su shows little interest in describing the mass and surface textures of his forms. Furthermore, individual motifs remain isolated, their interrelationships ambiguous. Like an opaque mist that reveals only disconnected glimpses of scenery, Su's landscape presents a composition that is fragmentary and disorienting. The artist's disregard for perspective or representational detail is underscored by his inscription, which makes clear that Su considered painting a conscious act of creation rather than an imitation of nature:Where my brush reaches the broken cliff with a rushing waterfall,I add a figure of a monk by the rock, gazing at the clouds.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H.

Wang even let the ink pool and seep into the satin in places, which created unpredictable patterns. This work demonstrates the enduring social function of calligraphy in Chinese society: the eighth century piece that Wang Duo copied was a letter sent between friends, and this large hanging scroll was given as a gift, possibly to solidify an important relationship.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP325256.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/633301
"Voting with Beans, Choosing a Good Candidate",Xiao Su (Zhao Keren),1930s and 1940s,"The Modern Woodcut Movement is an important but understudied chapter in the history of twentieth-century Chinese art. The movement was initiated by Lu Xun (1881C1936), the father of modern Chinese literature and an incisive cultural critic, who saw woodcut as the ideal medium for rousing what he saw as a complacent China from its slumber to face up to the challenges of the modern world. Easily produced from inexpensive materials and with relatively limited training, woodcut was seen as a counterpoint to the precious erudition of literati landscape painting. The medium was used extensively during the 1930s and ‘40s―by both Communist and Nationalist leaders―to disseminate political messages in a graphically impactful, legible form. Some of the most iconic vignettes from the War of Resistance (against Japan, 1937C45) and the Chinese Civil War (1945C49) were produced in this medium.

Grazing Horse,Xu Beihong,dated 1932,"Xu Beihong was the most influential proponent of Western academic realism in twentieth-century China. Inspired by the political reformer Kang Youwei (1858C1927), who advocated ""an integration of Chinese and Western art to create a new era of Chinese painting,"" Xu traveled to Japan in 1917 to study Western art and returned the following year to become an art instructor at Beijing University.

Until 1927 he studied in Paris and Berlin, mastering an already moribund academic style.This painting exemplifies Xu's fusion of East and West. While he employed the conventional Chinese medium of brush and ink, his drawing technique was purely Western. Rather than defining the horse with calligraphically energized outlines, he sketched it impressionistically, integrating light and dark washes and uninked areas of paper to suggest light and shadow. The horse's complex pose-foreshortened body, twisting neck, and naturalistically placed legs is deftly rendered with a few well-practiced brushstrokes, while the layered tones of the animal's tail give the impression of movement.Recalling the tradition of the horse as an emblem of state, Xu's spirited animals appeal to national pride. He painted so many of them that they have become synonymous with his name. Xu made this early example for Qi Baishi's son when going to visit Qi's house. Qi explains in his inscription that Xu failed to bring his seals, which is why the painting lacks an impression.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-25330-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49637
Production in the Eighth Road Army,Gu Yuan,1930s and 1940s,"The Modern Woodcut Movement is an important but understudied chapter in the history of twentieth-century Chinese art. The movement was initiated by Lu Xun (1881C1936), the father of modern Chinese literature and an incisive cultural critic, who saw woodcut as the ideal medium for rousing what he saw as a complacent China from its slumber to face up to the challenges of the modern world. Easily produced from inexpensive materials and with relatively limited training, woodcut was seen as a counterpoint to the precious erudition of literati landscape painting. The medium was used extensively during the 1930s and ‘40s―by both Communist and Nationalist leaders―to disseminate political messages in a graphically impactful, legible form. Some of the most iconic vignettes from the War of Resistance (against Japan, 1937C45) and the Chinese Civil War (1945C49) were produced in this medium. The current set of prints were produced in the Communist milieu―at Yan’an, the mountain stronghold in northern Shaanxi Province that served as the capital of the Communist government during the 1940s.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-26921-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/892926

Copy of Dong Qichang’s Wanluan Thatched Cottage,Qian Du,1803,"This painting is a copy of one of the most celebrated depictions of a rustic retreat in Chinese history: Dong Qichang’s Wanluan Thatched Cottage of 1597. Dong painted his strange, off-kilter composition to commemorate his friend Chen Jiru’s newly completed mountain villa. More than two centuries later, Qian Du lovingly copied every aspect of the painting, including three inscriptions by the artist and the many inscriptions by the Qianlong emperor that cover the painting’s surface. Qian followed the original in all respects but one: the long, pliant needles of the pine trees in the foreground are rendered in Qian’s distinctive manner.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-L_2016_67_27_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/737755
Climbing the Eastern Marchmount,Deng Shiru,1790,"石如 行 登|[ 八l屏 本Deng Shiru, a committed student of ancient calligraphy who traveled the length of China in search of inspiration, was one of the pioneer figures of the Epigraphic School. He wrote this work in commemoration of a trip to the summit of Mt. Tai, the most sacred mountain in traditional Chinese cosmology and a site of many early stone inscriptions. Deng is said to have used a long, flexible brush made of goat hair, which he could easily twist and drag to create the long, vertical strokes that you see throughout this work.

Snow Over an Expanse of Forests,Fu Baoshi,dated 1961,"Mount Changbai (“Eternally White”) stretches hundreds of miles along the Chinese border with Korea. When Fu Baoshi ascended its summit on a sketch trip in the summer of 1961, he proclaimed it the most extraordinary and magnificent site he had ever visited. In the inscription, he states that he had depicted the mountain’s spectacular scenery several times, but none captured its majestic grandeur in full. Rendered in dramatically contrasting light and dark, this landscape of expansive wilderness flecked with snow is considered closest to embodying his artistic vision of the place.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/SL_8_2012_3_9_Strm1_07.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77008

Various Subjects,Li Kuchan,dated 1972,"Between 1923 and 1925 Li Kuchan attended the National Art Academy in Beijing, where he studied Western painting under Xu Beihong (1895C1953) and Chinese painting under Qi Baishi (1864C1957). From 1930 to 1934 Li taught at the Hangzhou Art Academy as a colleague of Pan Tianshou (1897C1971). He then returned to Beijing and became a professor of painting at the Central Academy. This work, created at the height of the Cultural Revolution, graphically conveys Li's determination to preserve his dignity in the face of persecution.

Listening to the Waterfall in a Valley of Pines,Fu Baoshi,dated 1945,"The compactness of composition and the restless energy of this powerful work suggest inspiration from the late Yuan dynasty (1271C1368) master, Wang Meng (ca. 1308C1385). What gives it a modernist edge is, above all, the daring pointillist technique employed to characterize the rugged bluff to the left of the waterfall. Unlike anything in traditional Chinese painting, these rock formations are shaped solely by clusters of wet dots of varying tonalities. They recall the Impressionist feat of capturing light’s movements. Fu’s arbitrary application of the dots, however, reveals his Expressionist instincts.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/SL_8_2012_3_6_Strm1_09.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77005
Two Nuns,Lin Fengmian,20th century,"Many artists who studied in European academies in the 1920s and 1930s sought a knowledge of anatomy, perspective and chiaroscuro―techniques peripheral to Chinese art training. Some of these students for instance, Xu Beihong, came away from Europe with academic styles of painting as well as academic techniques.Lin Fengmian, who went to Paris in 1922, found academic realism lacking in expressiveness and gravitated to the Impressionists and the Fauves, with their strong colors and semi-abstract forms. He exhibited in the first show of Chinese art students in France in 1924. Four years later, he assumed directorship of the National Academy of Art and made Hangzhou the locus for study of modern Western art in China before the war. In 1937 he took students with him to the wartime capital of Zhongging.Lin's indebtedness to Matisse is clear in Two Nuns, but his reasons for finding Matisse so compelling lie in his training in the principles of Chinese art: economy of line, decorative value of pattern and use of empty space as form.Lin, married to a French woman, was accused during the Cultural Revolution of spying against China and was jailed. After the Cultural Revolution he left China for Hong Kong.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-31970-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49736
Nymph of the Luo,Yu Ming,Inscription dated 1942,"This painting depicts the Nymph of the Luo River, a mythical river goddess who was celebrated in a famous prose-poem by the poet and prince Cao Zhi (192C232 CE.) Cao’s influential early poem established the Nymph as a subject of erotic preoccupation in the Chinese literary imagination, a position further solidified by a seminal early painting of the subject by the pioneering painter Gu Kaizhi (c. 344C406). Celebrations of the Nymph of the Luo River and the famous poem and painting that immortalized her subsequently became common in Chinese culture. The painter Yu Ming’s friend and frequent collaborator Xu Zonghao 徐宗浩 (1880C1957), transcribed Cao’s lengthy poem in the upper register of the hanging scroll.Yu Ming was born in Wuxing and spent much of his career in Shanghai and Beijing. Though largely aligned with traditionalist groups that advocated the continued development of traditions of classical Chinese painting, Yu was also trained in European watercolor techniques.: According to Xu Zonghao’s inscription, this painting is a copy of an original image of the Nymph of the Luo River by the great Yuan dynasty painter Zhao Mengfu (1254C1322), and as such it reflects the interest in classical Chinese paintings that animated many of Yu’s patrons in Beijing and Shanghai.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-25780-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/856024
Five crabs,Qi Baishi,dated 1950,"Crabs became an important subject in Qi Baishi's painting after he moved into a new studio in 1913 and crabs frequented his backyard. He once observed, ""When a crab moves, its legs rise and fall in strict order despite their great number. This is something crab painters in the world do not know."" This work represents his mature style, when naturalism and abstraction found a new balance. The subtle gradation of the ink suggests the undulation of the shell's surface. The eyes have become two short slanting lines. The claws, as circular splotches of ink with two simple converging lines, are reduced to geometric abstraction. During the last forty years of his life Qi lived in Beijing and befriended people of radically different persuasions. His passive tolerance of things of which he might not approve shows in his sarcastic inscription to this painting, which reads: ""I just fold my arms and watch you gentlemen go."" The Chinese term for the sideways movement of crabs, hengxing, is also a metaphor for impudent behavior. Qi often humorously compared crabs to presumptuous people. Here, he states that he will simply stand aside and let these creatures have their way.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-29527-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72779
"Plum, Bamboo, and Rock",Xu Beihong,dated 1942,"This painting testifies to Xu Beihong's aspiration to revitalize Chinese painting with a new experimental eclecticism. The bamboo is meticulously outlined, then filled with colored wash in the refined, descriptive style of Song dynasty (960C1279) court painting, which Xu admired. But a roughly outlined ochre rock is virtually flat, while the patches of ink wash that texture the adjacent lower tree trunk arbitrarily extend beyond its contours. Such perfunctory modes of execution were often criticized by Xu as mannerisms afflicting the literati painting tradition. But in this case, Xu's incongruous mix of brush methods enhances the painting's appeal by shattering conventional expectations. The plum blossoms, rendered as daubs of white pigment with blue cores, represent an audacious departure from their traditional rendering in either ink outlines or pale color washes. The blue, surprising at first glance, realistically renders the shadows of intensely white objects; aesthetically it echoes the blue-green bamboo. The white blossoms, indistinct against the blank paper, faithfully capture the optical impression of white plum blossoms in a bleak wintry landscape. The inscribed poem reads:With its shadow it rests in the empty mountain;How swiftly the year has moved toward an end!The bright moon is chilly throughout the night;The subtle fragrance lingers in the vastness.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP144848.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72775
Ancient Warrior,Gao Jianfu,dated 1931,"Gao Jianfu was an early advocate of reforming the arts through the study of Western-style painting. In 1906 he went to Japan, where he studied a new form of ""Japanese-style"" painting that synthesized Western realism―natural light and luminous colors―with Eastern materials, techniques, and subject matter. This new hybrid art included the use of perspective, chiaroscuro, and other elements of Western painting.Gao's willingness to experiment with exotic subject matter and non-Chinese techniques is epitomized in Ancient Warrior, painted in Calcutta. The large-eyed, mustachioed figure was inspired by the new nationalistic painting style of the Bengali artist Abanindranath Tagore (1871C1931).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-30910-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36254

Wine Jar and Melon,Guo Dawei,dated 1959,"Born into a family of artists in Beijing, Guo Dawei studied painting under Qi Baishi (1864C1957) for three years in his youth, and their bond lasted a lifetime. Since Guo painted in the same abbreviated, expressive style as his mentor, his works are often mistaken for Qi's.Guo Dawei painted this scroll for Lin Yutang's daughter Taiyi and her husband Li Ming (Richard Lai) in the winter of 1959 when they were all visiting London. It demonstrates the visual impact of Guo's vigorous brushwork and bold use of color. He emphasized the qualities of weightiness and enormity in art, which this painting embodies with its sense of mass and architectonic structure.Although Guo Dawei came to the United States to study Western art in 1954, through the 1980s he remained committed to maintaining the purity of Chinese traditions. The abstract forms and the unnatural color of the melon in this painting, however, suggest that he was keenly aware of trends in Western modernist art.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP146991.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72805

Blossoming Plum,Li Ruiqing,ca. 1915,"In spite of Li Ruiqing's advocacy of Western technique in the practice and study of art, his own paintings were deeply rooted in the past, particularly in archaic forms of Chinese calligraphy preserved on ancient bronzes and stone steles.

White Peony and Rocks,Hua Yan,dated 1752,"Hua Yan worked in the prosperous city of Yangzhou at the time of the ""Eight Eccentrics,"" a group whose bold idiosyncratic style extended beyond painting to personal attitudes and behavior. In developing the style of the early Qing masters Shitao (1642C1707), Zhu Da (1626C1705), and Yun Shouping (1633C1690), Hua made daring use of color, fresh realism in representation, and an unabashed display of brush virtuosity that made him a favorite model of late Qing and modern Chinese painters.Hua Yan favored unorthodox juxtapositions such as the one seen here: suffused ink washes for the garden rocks contrasted with lyrical and perfectly controlled color tints for the delicate blossoms and leaves. In his inscription at upper left, he gives the Song dynasty sources for these two dissimilar techniques:I follow Ma Yuan [act. ca. 1190C1225] in chopping lean rocks,And imitate Xu Xi [act. 10th century] in plucking delicate blossoms.The two masters' styles have their bitter andsweet aspects;Together they enhance the taste of my tea on the firstchilly day of autumn.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/13_220_119.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49239
Vegetables,Qi Baishi,20th century,"When the Japanese occupation ended, Qi Baishi again posted his prices on the shops of Beijing's Liulichang and resumed selling his paintings and seals. Inflation was high and resources were scarce, but his paintings commanded high prices.

Evergreen Beauty,Yeung Tong Lung,2017,"Since the early 2000s, Yeung Tong Lung has painted ordinary lives in Hong Kong by juxtaposing reality and fiction, memory and observation. As important as the social documentation of urban stories in his pictures are the delicately rendered interior spaces framed through disjunctive perspectives that evoke nostalgia for the colonial Chinese city.Evergreen Beautydepicts an old-fashioned ground-floor hair salon in Hong Kong’s State Theatre shopping arcade. Through the glass storefront, we see a mixed-race woman holding an infant in the middle of the shop, her gaze averted; a man is slouched on the floor to her right. The 1970s era green floor tiles set the stage for the action figures on a shelf and movie poster on the shopfront glass that represent Hong Kong’s bygone industries and popular culture, as well as Yeung’s former career as a commercial painter. Behind the woman, a staircase leads to the upper floor, framing a backdoor passage to another part of the arcade where a Google Streetview operator walks by the Evergreen Beauty barbershop, whose Chinese and English sign is partially visible. At the lower left, reproductions of Pieter Jansz Saenredam’s church interiors allude to Yeung’s fascination with the Dutch painter’s explorations of perspective and proportion. The work itself is a metaphor for the history of painting through the act of looking as the cleverly constructed interior and lines of vision between the woman, the idle man, the gig worker, and the Google device bring together diverse viewpoints from Hong Kong to the larger narrative of global art history.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ma/mobile-large/IA-2024_405.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/910299
Five Water Buffalo,Qi Baishi,ca. 1937,"This work shows water buffalo in different postures and from various angles to playfully convey a sense of the beloved animal's personality.

My family persuaded me to repeat the composition and keep it for ourselves, since it is rather amusing.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H.

He advocated the study of late Ming/early Qing painters Shitao (1642C1707), Gong Xian (1619C1689), and Mei Qing (1623C1697).

Woodpecker,Gao Qifeng,dated 1927,"Gao Qifeng followed the example of his brother, Gao Jianfu (1878C1951), and studied art in Japan, where he encountered Western methods of realistic representation, such as shading, coloristic effects, and perspective.Here, Gao drew the blossoming branch in a dashing calligraphic style derived from Chinese eighteenth-century flower-and-bird painting, while he rendered the ruffled plumage of the woodpecker in a far more descriptive manner that includes the deft use of white highlights―a technique he learned in Japan.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-30482-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49623
Zhong Kui,Ren Yi (Ren Bonian),dated 1883,"Ren Yi, a leader of the late Qing Shanghai school of painting, was a disciple of the painter Ren Xiong (1820C1857). A prolific artist, Ren Yi commanded a wide range of techniques. In this depiction of Zhong Kui, the legendary Demon Queller, for example, he adopted the figural style of Chen Hongshou (1598C1652).During the late Qing dynasty, Zhong Kui became a popular symbol of Chinese opposition to the misrule of the Manchus and was often portrayed glowering ferociously over a motley retinue of cowering ghosts and demons. In Ren Yi's depiction, however, Zhong Kui appears as an elegant, if somewhat eccentric, scholar. His sword sheathed and a blossom stuck in his hair, he sits reading decorously beside a table laid out with archaic bronzes filled with flowers and fruits, an image that suggests it was the Chinese scholars' command of their cultural heritage rather than their military prowess that set them apart from their Manchu overlords.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-35707-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/37393
Origins of Sound,Qin Feng,Dated 1997,"Born in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of northwestern China, Qin Feng received formal training in oil painting, ink painting, and calligraphy at the Shandong Art Institute and in the 1980s experimented with Western avant-garde media. Once he moved abroad, however, Qin Feng, like other contemporary expatriate artists from China, chose to return to the materials of calligraphy and traditional ink painting, merging Chinese techniques and forms with gestures from Western expressionism. His work of the last decade often explores the theme of the ""origins"" of civilization and incorporates autobiographical reflections, including his childhood memories of watching the physical torture and suffering of his parents during the Cultural Revolution (1966C76).This album was created in 1997, one year after Qin Feng moved to Berlin and had his first exhibitions in Europe. Viewed in the traditional manner, as individual leaves beginning on the far right, the composition emphasizes the passage of time. The comma-shaped dabs of bright red ink resemble drops of blood that, raining across the pages, seem to be swept by a wind, gathering together to form proto-ideographs and evolving into the Chinese characters for the cardinal directions―north, south, east, west, and center―as well as the names of the seasons. The only legible calligraphy in the work, however, quickly dissolves back into small dabs of ink. The thick, black brushstroke that sweeps horizontally across the entire work unites each pair of facing pages and resembles the heavily inked forms seen in many of Qin's massive hanging scrolls.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/2009_325_sec11.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73661
Willow in the Morning Breeze,Gao Jianfu,dated 1949,"Gao Jianfu came of age with the fall of the dynasty, and like many of his contemporaries he eagerly sought solutions to China's backwardness in the culture of the West. He was fascinated with light and atmosphere as conveyed in Western painting.In this lovely fan, done after a lifetime of experimentation with Western perspective, modeling, color and chiaroscuro, Gao has created a particularly Chinese rendition of light.

Portrait of Qian Lou,Yu Ming,1932,"This painting depicts Qian Lou, a famous recluse who lived during Warring States period (c. 475C221 BC). Qian sits on a mat before a low table, where he prepares to write on an unfurled piece of paper. Brush in hand, inkstone and water pot at the ready, a bundle of scrolls at his side, Qian is depicted as the consummate humble scholar at his craft. Along the left side of the scroll, Yu transcribed a lengthy biography of Qian Lou from the third century text Gao shi zhuan (Accounts of high-minded men).The painter Yu Ming was born in Wuxing and spent much of his career in Shanghai and Beijing. Though largely aligned with traditionalist groups that advocated the continued development of traditions of classical Chinese painting, Yu was also trained in European watercolor techniques. According to Yu Ming’s second inscription, this painting is a copy of an original image of Qian Lou by the great Ming dynasty painter Wen Zhengming (1470C1559), and as such it reflects the interest in classical Chinese paintings that animated many of Yu’s patrons in Beijing and Shanghai.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-25779-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/856023
Shadow,Shao Fan,2009,"Shao was exposed to art from an early age: both his parents taught Soviet-style oil painting, and his father had a collection of traditional painting, calligraphy, and furniture, which he was able to retain during the Cultural Revolution owing to his high status in the Communist party. Shao studied wood carving and porcelain making in Beijing, but soon began to rethink much of what he studied at school, and to explore “how to be a Chinese artist, by trial and error.” This led, in 1995, to his famous Chair series in which historic Ming-style forms are reconstructed into sleek, sometimes surreal, modern hybrids using contemporary forms, techniques, and materials. Teasing the boundaries between art and design, these works not only illuminate aesthetic connections across time and culture, but in a way also demonstrate how China’s past can both adapt to and coexist with its rapidly changing and increasingly globalized present.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP284977.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76090
500 Brushstrokes #10,Wu Jian’an,2016,"Viewed from a distance, Wu Jian’an’s 500 Brushstrokes, #10 appears to be a riot of gestural ink brushstrokes spread across a massive rectangle of absorbent Xuan paper―the work of an artist possessed by urgent forces of expression that poured forth without restraint. Upon closer examination, the work’s deliberate, even painstaking, composite nature becomes apparent. Each of the dynamic brushstrokes has been carefully cut out of its original context and collaged into the larger whole using traditional Chinese conservation techniques, which allow for nearly seamless layering of paper on paper. In scale and aesthetic, the resulting work evokes the passion and gestalt of postwar American action painting, but its material orientation reveals a more nuanced and layered understanding of abstraction. Wu’s work invites us to question inherited assumptions about the meaning and mechanics of large-scale gestural abstraction, which are so heavily textured by the lionizing stories of Pollock, Kline, and others of their generation. Far from the urgent outpouring of emotion that it seems at first, 500 Brushstrokes is a celebration of deliberation, craftsmanship, material, and conservation technique. In this way, Wu has incorporated not only postwar American abstraction, but also premodern Chinese painting and conservation to the layered portfolio of inspirations that have led to this highly original artwork.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/Brownstein_01.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/853982
Gibbons and Deer,Unidentified artist,未知年代,"This painting is a rebus or pictorial pun, that conveys a wish for success on an examination.

The Virtuous Being,Hao Liang,2015,"This work is a complex and layered homage to the history of literati gardens. The scroll begins by reimagining the most famous garden painting in Chinese history, Wang Wei’s (699C759) Wangchuan Villa, as a series of ghostly ruins. Slowly, the scroll transitions to color from black and white. The painting then shifts to an exploration of the Ming-dynasty garden of the scholar Wang Shizhen, in Taicang, Jiangsu. From there, Hao takes the viewer on a journey to the present day, where Wang’s garden, which was destroyed in the twentieth century, has been rebuilt. The new garden features a garish Ferris wheel, which Hao shows spinning off its axis and spewing its cars across the scroll, across boundaries of space and time.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-TR_192_1a_c_2a_u_2017_sr1-024_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/747860
Primeval Chaos,Ren Jian,1987C88,"Measuring nearly five feet tall and one hundred feet long when fully unrolled, Ren’s cosmic vision of an amorphous world follows the format and medium of traditional painting, but the scale, subject matter, and the industrial material on which it was painted owe nothing to earlier Chinese art forms. The scroll blends Eastern and Western imagery―cosmic spheroids and mandala-like drawings; swirling vortices and hovering clouds―in a succession of crescendos as it unrolls from left to right, a departure from the right-left orientation of traditional handscrolls. Further distancing the work from Chinese precedents is the use of Western-style chiaroscuro to describe the clouds, hills, and other landscape elements.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/Fig  50_Ren Jian_Primeval Chaos.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77508
Setting Sun on the Autumn River,Pan Yunyu,1604 or 1664,"As the sun sets behind him, a solitary scholar sits in the prow of a skiff on a placid river. On the nearby bank a grove of trees explodes in autumn colors, while on the distant shore a stand of trees is silhouetted against a mountain ridge.

"Stamping the Water (Performance in the Lhasa River, Tibet, 1996)",Song Dong,1996,"Song began his career as an oil painter, but in the years after 1989 he increasingly shifted his focus to installation and performance art.These iconic photographs capture Song’s most famous performance, in which he sat in the Lhasa River in Tibet for an hour repeatedly stamping the water with a large wood seal carved with the Chinese character for water (shui 水). The piece is, among other things, a meditation on the evanescence of inscribed language.

Landscape with figure,Qian Shoutie,mid-20th century,"At the center of a vortex of bold ink marks, a small figure in a wide-brimmed hat walks along a mountain path. The experimental, nearly abstract quality of this landscape was inspired by the seventeenth-century painter Shitao, whom Qian Shoutie admired as a sign of the advanced, modern spirit inherent in classical Chinese painting. The contrast between the chaotic intensity of the landscape and the solidity of the man who strides confidently at its center underscores the idea of the recluse as an intrepid figure who daringly walks his own path.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-L_2016_67_28_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/737757
Portrait of Laozi,Yu Ming,Inscription dated 1923,"This painting depicts the Daoist philosopher Laozi seated cross-legged on a humble reed mat. The Laozi in this image is not the deified figure revered in religious Daoism, but rather the man who walked the earth prior to his deification. Wearing a simple white scholar’s robe and black hat, Laozi sits surrounded by books, an allusion to his role as royal archivist at the court of the Zhou dynasty. The artist has used tones of ochre to describe a deeply pitted face wizened with age.The painter Yu Ming was born in Wuxing and spent much of his career in Shanghai and Beijing. Though largely aligned with traditionalist groups that advocated the continued development of classical Chinese painting, Yu was also trained in European watercolor techniques. According to the long inscription by Yu’s friend Xu Zonghao, most of which transcribes Laozi’s biography in the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) by Sima Qian (c. 145Cc. 86 BCE), this painting is a copy of an original image of Laozi by the great Yuan dynasty painter Zhao Mengfu (1254C1322), and as such it reflects the interest in classical Chinese paintings that animated many of Yu’s patrons in Beijing and Shanghai.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-25778-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/856022
Seascape at Beidaihe,Wu Guanzhong,Sep-77,"In 1936 Wu Guanzhong enrolled in the Hangzhou Academy of Art, where he studied Western oil painting under Lin Fengmian (1900C1991). From 1947 to 1950 he was in Paris, immersing himself in the works of Cézanne, Gauguin, and Matisse before returning to China as a lecturer at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. Wu's modernism conflicted with the views of the academy's director and with the Social Realist style of Soviet models and he was trans-ferred to another post. During the Cultural Revolution he was sent into the countryside for three years and did not paint. Wu began working in Chinese ink on paper only after 1972.In this work, inspired by Mao Zedong's poem about the summer resort of Beidaihe, Wu translated actual scenery into a composition that verges on abstraction. Except for the boats that dot the horizon and the black silhouettes of protruding rocks, the surface is given over to a mesmerizing depiction of waves. Wu painted out some of his ink lines with opaque white―something a traditional Chinese artist would never do―to prevent linear patterns from predominating over the illusion of light reflected from the water. In contrast to the literati objective of capturing the essence of the natural world through abstract calligraphic brushwork, Wu exploited the tension between abstraction and the vivid evocation of three-dimensional forms to create an intensely personal encounter with nature.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-32015-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36417
Yan Family Temple Stele,Yan Zhenqing,20th century,"The calligraphy reproduced in this rubbing was engraved on a stone stele erected at the family temple of the official and calligrapher Yan Zhenqing. The text on the stele, which is dedicated to Yan's father, records the achievements of earlier generations of the family. The original stele is preserved today in the Forest of Stelae in Xi'an. Although many forms of calligraphy were practiced during the Tang dynasty, standard script from that period had the greatest impact on the later history of the art. In standard script, exemplified by Yan's stele inscription, square-shaped characters are written with articulated strokes that have complex turns, hooks, and dots.From the Tang dynasty on, this script type was used extensively for formal documents and public monuments. Standard script is the form of calligraphy first learned by children and is the basis for the typefaces used in Chinese printing. One of the most influential artists in Chinese history, Yan Zhenqing was also a prominent statesman of the Tang dynasty and suffered a martyr's death when he refused to submit to rebels intent on overthrowing the dynasty. This monumental writing is seen by scholars of calligraphy as a powerful reflection of Yan's unconquerable integrity.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/1977_375_14a_d_sf.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/64029
Lotus Peak,Liu Haisu,dated 1975,"This small album leaf, which depicts one of the principal peaks of Yellow Mountain, resembles a sketch from nature in its sensitively drawn contours. Done when the artist was nearly eighty, it eschews the bravura brushwork of a decade earlier in favor of juxtaposed areas of ink wash and uninked paper that create the effect of sun and shadow, white clouds and verdant valleys. This experimentation with Western ideas and techniques, reflected in Liu Haisu's drawing style and in his strongly contrasted areas of light and dark, was a way of liberating him-self from traditional constraints. His inscription reads:""I haven't painted for a long time. [My brush] has grown cold and clumsy. It is a pleasure to wash away [styles] of the past and present.""(Robert H. Ellsworth et al., trans., Later Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 1800-1950, 3 vols.

Two Riders,Bao Shichen,未知年代,"Bao Shichen, a literatus better known as a seal carver and calligrapher than as a painter, wrote an influential treatise, Paired Oars for the Boat of Art, in support of the bold calligraphic styles found in carved stone monuments (bei) of the Six Dynasties period. Bao's appreciation of the new aesthetic led others to value contemporary experiments in bei styles by such calligraphers as Deng Shiru (1743C1805).Bao's calligraphy, still in the style of informal brush-written models (tie), dominates this painting, not only in the form of a long inscription but also in the emblematic use of a conventional image rendered in simply brushed ink line and wash. The inscription is Bao's commentary on ambition:Some chase fame at court. Some chase gain in the market. He who attains fame returns content; he who attains wealth returns secure. There are so many who never cease to strive. The universe is huge and never-ending, with myriads of people and as many ambitions.Trans. adapted from Ellsworth et al., Later Chinese Painting]But nowhere is the huge universe would Bao's ambitions be satisfied: he repeated failed the examinations for the jinshi (presented scholar) degree that would have earned him a higher post in government service.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-30198-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41907
Beneficent Rain,Zhang Yucai,late 13thCearly 14th century,"Zhang Yucai, the thirty-eighth pope of the Zhengyi (""Orthodox Unity"") Daoist church, lived at Mount Longhu (Dragon Tiger Mountain) in Jiangxi Province. A favorite of the Yuan emperors, he received commendation from the Mongol court for inducing needed rain and for subduing a ""tide monster"" that had plagued the eastern seacoast.Dragons, as symbols of nature's elemental forces, have been depicted in Chinese art from time immemorial. A special genre, dragon paintings were given powerful treatment by such Southern Song masters as Chen Rong (act. ca. 1235-62) and the Chan Buddhist painter Muqi (act. ca. 1240-75). In a fourteenth-century account, Chen's working methods are described as follows: He ""makes clouds by splashing ink, creates vapor by spraying water, and, while drunk, shouting loudly, takes off his cap, soaks it in ink, and smears and rubs with it, before finishing the painting with a brush.""On Chen Rong's celebrated Nine Dragons handscroll dated 1244, in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, there is a colophon dated 1331 by Zhang Yucai's son Zhang Sicheng, the thirty-ninth Daoist pope (r. 1317C44). Beneficent Rain is closely related to Chen Rong's Nine Dragons both in content and in style, and may have been directly inspired by the Boston scroll or others like it.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP213969_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40454
The Mythos of Lost Dynasties-Form C: Pseudo-seal Scripture in Calligraphic Copybook Format,Gu Wenda,1983C87,"Created from 1983 to 1987, the Pseudo-seal Scripture in Calligraphic Copybook Format series consists of 50 works that each showcases ten seal-script characters written within a two-by-five grid. The characters are typically set against an amorphous background that resembles clouds or mist. Gu achieved this effect by splashing water over the half-dried ink of the written characters―a signature process developed and deployed by the artist in many of his conceptual paintings during the 1980s. In the current gift, the splashy patterns of ink appear to originate from the characters and radiate outwards.Confidently executed in fluid forms with lines of uniform width, Gu’s characters resemble traditional seal script writing, an early form of Chinese script that came to be used for seals carved from stone or cast from bronze, but they are in fact characters invented by Gu, who has combined familiar ideographic components to create nonsensical forms. Though they have the authoritative visual presence of seal script, none of the characters is legible. The gridded arrangement, which heightens the work’s initial impression of authority, is taken from the copybook format, the foundational tool of basic training for young calligraphers. It is through repetitive copying from copybooks that amateur calligraphers master the fundamentals of script types and composition. By undermining the viewers’ assumption of the characters’ legitimacy and the authority of the copying practice, Gu questions the function of language in documenting history and disseminating culture. While Gu’s conceptual engagement with language at the time was influenced by his study of Western texts, particularly those of Wittgenstein, Freud, Nietzsche, and Popper, his works ultimately addressed the unique situations of contemporary China. Gu has said, “most Chinese people, even educated ones, are unable to read seal-script characters. This idea of ‘unreadability’ conveyed a mythical sense of infinity and eternity to me…In their outright rejection of classical Chinese traditions and in their suggestion of something clandestine, the Pseudo-Characters series represented my first brush with a societal taboo.” (Wu Hung, Transience:Chinese Experimental Art at the End of the Twentieth Century. Chicago: David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art, University of Chicago, 1999, p. 41)The appearance of newsprint impressions in the areas of ink wash is the result of using newspaper to absorb the water that Gu poured over the written surface to achieve a blurred effect (August 1, 2013 email exchange with Guo Zhen, Gu's ex-wife, who sometimes participated in the production of Gu’s works in the 1980s).Two red seals are stamped on the upper and lower left corners in the lower left grid Wenda 文达 (the artist’s name) and xinhe心壑 (meaning “gullies of the mind”).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP361751.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78911

Bamboo and rocks,Li Kan,dated 1318,"Li Kan was a northern Chinese who entered the service of the Mongol government at an early period and rose to a high position in the Yuan court. The author of an authoritative treatise on bamboo painting, Li stated that the painter must possess ""the complete bamboo in [his] breast,"" and he urged statesmen to take up bamboo painting to discipline their minds and expand their breadth of vision.Li completed these panels in 1318, the year the Mongol regime reinstituted the civil-service examinations, the chief means for scholars to gain access to official positions. The painting is done in the shuangou, or ""double-outline,"" style of bamboo painting. This technique, in which finely drawn ink outlines are filled in with dense mineral pigments, was ideally suited to Li Kan's intense identification with bamboo.

Ci Poem by Su Shi,Lin Yutang,dated 1968,"In this piece written for his daughter Taiyi, Lin Yutang transcribes a poem by the renowned literatus Su Shi (1037C1101). This poem describes, in a humorous tone, an awkward situation Su Shi encountered when he was banished to Huangzhou (present-day Huanggang, Hubei) from 1080 to 1084. Being locked out of his own house late one night, he transformed his predicament into an aesthetic experience:After a drink at night at Dongpo [in Huangzhou],I wake up and get drunk again;By the time I come home it seems to be midnight.The boy servant is asleep, snoring like thunder,And does not answer the door.Resting on a cane I listen to the murmur of the river.I always regret that I am not master of my own life.When can I stop this hustling about?The night is late, the air is calm, and the water has a sheen of unruffled light.Let me take a small boat down the river hence,To spend beyond the seas the remainder of my days.(trans. after Lin Yutang)Su Shi's self-mockery certainly appealed to Lin Yutang, the Chinese master of humor. In his biography of Su, The Gay Genius: The Life and Times of Su Tungpo (1947), Lin describes him as ""an incorrigible optimist, a great humanitarian, a friend of the people, a prose master, an original painter, a great calligraphist, an experimenter in wine making, an engineer, a hater of Puritanism, a yogi, a Buddhist believer, a Confucian statesman, a secretary to the emperor, a confirmed winebibber, a humane judge, a dissenter in politics, a prowler in the moonlight, a poet, and a wag.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP146972.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72789

Buddhist Sage,Wang Zhen,dated 1928,"A successful Shanghai businessman as well as a devout Buddhist, Wang Zhen is best known for his paintings of Buddhist figures in the calligraphic brush manner of his mentor, Wu Changshi (1844C1927). This large-scale work, made one year after his master's death, not only reveals Wang's devotion to Chan (Zen) Buddhism but may also refer to his role as Wu's disciple. The painting portrays the legendary Indian monk Bodhidharma, who is credited with introducing Chan Buddhism into China, and his Chinese disciple Huike, who cut off his arm to demonstrate his spiritual conviction and prove his worthiness to become a follower. Wang's use of rich colors and bold ink dots and slashes in his description of the landscape is typical of his teacher's style; the simplified outlines of his figures, however, may be inspired by the works of such Song- and Yuan-dynasty Chan painters as Liang Kai (active early 13th century) and Yintuoluo (active ca. 1340), whose paintings Wang could have seen on his business trips to Japan.Wang's inscription reads:A sage from the WestPreaches the miraculous doctrine of the Upper Vehicle.Preaching, he sits under a bodhi tree,With roosting birds listening in silence.The Wheel of the Law is as bright as a full moon,Its precious light illuminating the lamp of transmission.Ailing worshipers travel from afarTo receive guidance from the monk at the stone cave.(Wen C.

Man in a Forest,Fu Baoshi,20th century,"Fu Baoshi did not devote himself fully to painting until after 1939, when he settled in the wartime capital of Chongqing, Sichuan. There, poverty-stricken and struggling to support a growing family, he painted with a fierce determination to succeed. Often, he created images of himself in the guise of tragic historical figures who were not adequately appreciated during their lifetime. In this work, dating to the early 1940s, he depicts himself lost in a thick grove of trees and bamboo. His inscription quotes lines from a poem by Du Fu (712C770):Pity that the young pine trees cannot grow a thousand feet tall, So let the thicket of bamboo be cut down by the tens of thousands.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H.

"Bhadra, The Sixth Luohan",Unidentified artist,dated 1345,"Luohans (arhats, in Sanskrit) or ""worthy ones"" are disciples of Shakyamuni Buddha to whom he entrusted the guardianship of the Buddhist law. In China these enlightened beings became the focus of popular veneration and were typically shown in groups of sixteen, eighteen, or five hundred.This painting of the sixth luohan, one of twelve that survive from a set of eighteen, is typical of the Chinese treatment of this subject. Inspired by the powerful portraits of individual luohans created by the monk-artist Guanxiu (832C912), the figure is dressed like a monk but given exotic facial features to emphasize his non-Chinese origins. Shown as dwelling in the wilderness, his appearance of spiritual authority is enhanced by his frequent companion, a tiger, which is also the Chinese cosmological symbol of the West.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP235497.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36057

Searching for My Parents,Huang Xiangjian,dated 1656,"This painting illustrates Huang Xiangjian's perilous journey through Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces in one of the most celebrated acts of filial piety in late imperial Chinese history. In 1643 Huang's father was appointed county magistrate in Yunnan, and for nearly a decade thereafter, Huang heard nothing from his parents. Not knowing whether they had survived the ravages of warfare following the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, he set out in 1652 from his home in Suzhou and traveled over 1,400 miles in search of his parents. In his vivid published account, Huang describes the many hardships he endured before being reunited with his parents in rural Yunnan. He eventually escorted them back home, completing his round-trip journey in 558 days.Painted three years after his return, this handscroll documents the most arduous portion of the journey, including treacherous mountain trails and the military garrisons where he faced interrogation. Impoverished, injured, and sobbing, he often had to convince armed troops that he was not a spy but was merely trying to obtain passage in search of his parents.

The entirety of the paper is covered in an overall field of saturated ink wash that varies from very dilute to nearly jet black. The ink is arrayed across the surface in irregular shapes that call to mind tiny multicellular organisms seen through a microscope―small in some places, large in others, pushing and pulling as they merge into one another and separate. In places, the edges of these shapes are fringed with fractal patterns where ink has bled into moistened paper in uncontrollable ways.

After 1950 he embraced Russian-inspired Social Realism in large-scale works on such subjects as the history of the Chinese Communist Revolution.This painting marks a change in Shi Lu's style.

Mountains Clearing after Rain,Zhang Daqian,ca. 1965C70,"This small landscape exemplifies Zhang Daqian's splashed-ink-and-color method of painting, which he developed in the mid-1960s. In such paintings, he first applied washes of layered ink and intense colors in a semiautomatic manner, then added images of houses, trees, and other details to transform his atmospheric coloring into a suggestive three-dimensional landscape. According to Zhang's inscription, ""the peaks along the river separate the clearing slopes from the rain.""Zhang's exposure to Western abstract art played a crucial role in the development of his new style. His acquaintance with Zao Wou-ki (b. 1921), a Chinese expatriate painter working in Paris, was particularly important. In the early 1950s Zao often saturated his canvases with overlapping layers of color onto which he would draw houses, boats, and other figurative motifs. His integration of the abstract with the figurative and the sense of atmospheric expansiveness through nuanced use of color may have inspired Zhang Daqian's splashed painting in both concept and approach.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-29284-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73163
Buddha of Longevity,Li Ruiqing,dated 1917,"A native of Linquan, Jiangxi Province, Li Ruiqing passed the palace (jinshi) examination in 1895 and served as a scholar in the esteemed Hanlin Academy. After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, he remained loyal to the fallen Qing dynasty (1644C1911) and took the sobriquet ""Qingdaoren"" (Qing Daoist). He moved to Shanghai and eked out a living selling his paintings and calligraphies.This depiction of the Buddha of Longevity is highly unconventional and provocative. Instead of being shown in his Western Paradise, the Buddha sits alone in a cave, recalling the Chan (Zen) patriarch Bodhidharma meditating before a cliff face and bringing to mind the ideal of the individual pursuit of enlightenment through spiritual striving and physical austerity. Li's strident palette and intentionally naive drawing style may be intended to evoke the primary colors and archaic style found in Buddhist wall paintings of sixth- and seventh-century cave temples at Dunhuang, but his assertive contour lines and dynamic composition have a self-conscious quality that is distinctly modern. Li's inscription on a rock, which recalls the weather-worn monumental writings on cliffs, expresses the desire for release from an existence that, from a political point of view, he finds painful:On the fifth day of the fifth month of 1917, Qingdaoren painted this Buddha of Longevity with respect. [I] pray that [I] will be reborn in the Western paradise and be released from this sordid existence forever. All people should have this good fortune.(Robert H.

Charging Yak,Wu Zuoren,dated 1946,"Wu Zuoren studied Western art techniques and methods with Xu Beihong in Shanghai before going to Europe in 1930. He studied at the école des Beaux Arts, Paris, and under Alfred Bastien at the Académie Royale in Brussels. Wu mastered charcoal sketching and oil painting for making realistic anatomical studies but came to view these techniques as merely preliminary steps toward achieving a seemingly spontaneous style using Chinese ink and paper.Returning to China in 1935, Wu taught under Xu Beihong at Nanjing Central University and followed the university to Chongqing during the war. In 1943 he began traveling in the Tibetan plateau and Qinghai region, living with herdsmen while painting yaks and camel caravans on the vast highland plains. After 1949 Wu's sympathetic portrayals of minority peoples became consonant with the political agenda: to broaden the appeal of art, address the lives of the common folk, and confirm a nationalistic spirit.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP162722.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36381
Landscape after Wu Zhen,Wang Yuanqi,dated 1695,"According to his inscription, Wang Yuanqi did this landscape in the manner of the Yuan painter Wu Zhen (1280C1354). But in Wang's interpretation, Wu Zhen's distinctive idiom of dragged texture strokes and dotting has been used to create a densely patterned scene in which foreground and distant mountains are fused into a continuous ""dragon vein"" of abstract compositional energy.Wang's poem reads:In olden days, Wu Daozi [active 8th century] saw Fei Min perform in a sword dance, and, letting his brush fly, he did a wall painting. When Zhang Xu [active mid-8th century] saw the way the carriers balance the loads on their poles, his ""draft"" script became even more refined. When I saw Shao Jiuji, I joyously had a sudden insight and casually did this picture. Although past and present painters cannot reach each other, yet what the mind comprehends and the hand responds to―this means the same for all. I am giving this away for a laugh.(Ashwin Lippe, trans., in Laurence Sickman, ed., Chinese Calligraphy and Painting in the Collection of John M.

Quatrain on Snow-covered West Lake,Emperor Lizong,ca. 1250C60,"This fan is not dated, but the style of the writing is very close to that of Lizong's inscription accompanying Landscape at Sunset (Nezu Museum, Tokyo), a painting by the court artist Ma Lin (active ca. 1180Cafter 1256) that is dated 1254. The poem probably describes the scenery around West Lake in Hangzhou, the capital of the Southern Song dynasty:On the lake, a bright frozen mist lingers;On the lake, brilliant sights beckon.From the pavilion, I gaze at the mountain peaks;The color of snow and a hazy vapor shine in mywinecup.(Wen C.

Drunken Old Farmer,Feng Zikai,ca. 1947,"Feng Zikai's intellectual development was fostered under the tutelage of the influential Buddhist scholar and painter Li Shutong (Hongyi, 1880C1942). Feng later studied in Japan, learning Western drawing and music and discovering the Japanese cartoon tradition. When he returned to China, he answered the call for an art responsive to the needs of an broadly defined national culture with moving, humane depictions of common people in real situations, using a cartoonlike style based on woodblock illustration. This image, which derives from a woodblock print by Feng dated 1940, was painted after 1948, as indicated to by an artist's seal that states, ""Done after attaining the age of fifty."" The simple linear drawing, enlivened with color, illustrates lines from a poem describing an old man leaving a country tavern:An old drunken farmer staggers as if dancing,Supported by two children who help him back to the boat.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H.

Small dwelling in a dense grove of trees,Chen Mei,1730,"A small, white-walled building sits partially hidden within a dense grove of tall trees. From the vegetation that grows up and over the distressed walls and roof of the structure, one senses that it is long neglected, if not a ruin, yet signs of human habitation linger in the form of chickens and an ox. Something round, likely a millstone, can be seen behind the wall of the compound. At the upper right of the scroll, the painter’s signature reads, “Painted three days before the winter solstice in the gengxu year of the Yongzheng reign period by Zaidong, Chen Mei.”Chen Mei was an artist from Songjiang (in today’s Shanghai) who traveled north to serve the Qing court, where he studied with Jiao Bingzhen, a leading court painter who had trained in both European and Chinese painting techniques. This painting, dated 1730, is relatively early in Chen’s oeuvre, but it postdates his arrival at the court in Beijing, and it seems to evince a familiarity with European visual culture. Though he executed the work using exclusively Chinese materials of brush, ink, and the mineral and vegetable pigments, the painter also layered ink and pigments of close tonal value to create a diffuse, almost airbrushed effect that seems inspired by the play of light in European paintings.Though he worked as a painter in the imperial workshops, Chen Mei also took work from private clients, and this painting comes from the latter context.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-34453-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/904016
Clouds and Waterfalls at Yangdang,Lu Yanshao,dated 1980,"Lu Yanshao, from the Jiading district of Shanghai, received his early training from literati artists in the circle of the noted scholar-painter and connoisseur Wu Hufan (1894C1970).During the war Lu augmented his study of the ancient masters by painting landscapes. Rather than depict these mountains from a distance, however, Lu cropped the image so that there is neither horizon nor repoussoir. The viewer is plunged into the midst of the landscape, where the visual drama is reinforced by the immediacy of the vigorous texture strokes and colorful washes.Lu's inscription reads:Early morning clouds rest halfway of the ridge, and waterfalls are draped across the thousand peaks. How magnificent is this view of the Yandang Mountain. Only after a long rain can you know its wonders.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H.

Untitled,Qiu Shihua,2006,"Untitled, like all of Qiu Shihua’s mature paintings, appears upon first impression to be nothing more than a blank white canvas (Figure 1). Extended viewing, however, reveals forms beneath layered applications of white paint, which begin to coalesce into a legible scene if given sufficient time to emerge. In the case of Untitled, which Qiu painted in 2006 during an extended stay in the San Francisco Bay Area, groupings of gray marks, barely legible at first glance, seem to emerge as if from a thick layer of fog, coalescing into a landscape scene, perhaps a mist-enshrouded, tree-lined lakeshore, or maybe even the San Francisco skyline. Qiu achieves this effect by first painting a basic outline of a scene in black or another dark color, often on unprimed canvas, and then obscuring that scene with repeated layers of dilute, semitransparent paint. In refusing to pander to the eye, Qiu forces the viewer to slow down and allow the scene to emerge, thereby putting the viewer into a frame of mind close to meditation, a flow state in which he himself purports to paint: “When I paint, I do not think of structure or theme, what I seek is a certain ‘flavour’―a rhythm of spirit and energy, so that the soul drifts in the painting, like a shadow in the mind. Everything is flat and calm. ‘Form’ is unimportant.” Qiu is deeply interested in Daoist philosophy, which sees the cosmos as a field of interacting opposites―yin and yang, light and dark, solid and void―and his paintings eloquently embody this worldview, denying the viewer knowledge of whether the image is emerging or disappearing. Qiu’s rigorous minimalism, which draws in equal measure on ideas and visual traditions of Europe and China, is a vivid encapsulation of the hybridity and richness of contemporary Chinese painting, in which artists often have a broad range of sources upon which to draw for inspiration.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/2014_726_F_sf.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/653465

Draft of "Such is the Beauty of Our Rivers and Mountains",Fu Baoshi,datable to 1959,"In 1959, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, Fu Baoshi collaborated with Guan Shanyue (1921C2000) on a grand composition for the Great Hall of the People in Tian’anmen Square―Such Is the Beauty of Our Rivers and Mountains. This official commission was a milestone in Fu’s career, a symbolic affirmation of traditional-style Chinese painting that had been criticized in the new China. The painting became the country’s new cultural icon, a national symbol of the time.This scroll is one of Fu’s preliminary drafts for the commission. It is based on Mao Zedong’s poem “Snow,” in which Mao described the magnificence of China’s rivers and mountains. Fu’s pictorial interpretation unites the four seasons and the four corners of the nation in a single composition.

The poem concludes with a celebration of the Nationalists’ eventual defeat, bringing forth tears of joy from the heavens.Fu Baoshi’s painting shows the legendary figures greeting the “good souls,” while down on earth red revolutionary flags dot a vast expanse. Flying willow leaves and falling rain fill the space between.

For Zhang, one of the most striking discoveries in the murals was the depiction of female figures, which had a robustness and solidity very different from the willowy, languid figures of more recent painting. Zhang, who had come to Dunhuang in search of unexplored avenues from history that might help restore the vigor of Chinese painting, was inspired by these figures, which he saw as the antidote to a withering tradition.

Pine Cliff and Waterfall,Liu Haisu,dated 1964,"Liu Haisu studied Western painting in Shanghai, Japan, and Europe, favoring the expressive styles of the Post-Impressionists over the academic realism advocated by Xu Beihong (1895C1953) and the Soviet-inspired Social Realists. In spite of Liu's progressive outlook, his oil painting style, in the coarse, impasto manner of van Gogh, changed little during his long career; his Chinese-style paintings show a similarly vigorous brushwork.This picture reflects Liu's enduring interest in traditional landscape painting, particularly the bold style of the early Qing individualist master Shitao (1642C1707). Like Shitao, Liu sought inspiration directly from nature, particularly the dramatic cliffs and craggy pines of Yellow Mountain. As he proudly proclaims in the legend of one of the seals on this scroll: ""Yellow Mountain is my teacher.""

Orchids and Bamboo was painted when the artist was fifty, about the time he was appointed to a government post in northern China. Both painting and poem look forward to retirement in the south and celebrate the literati ideal of retreating to nature.

My Left Hand: Me (Memories),Sheng Qi,2000,"Sheng Qi was one of the early pioneers in the body work and performance art movements in China. He fled the country after the suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, for Europe and a period of self-exile. Disgusted with the oppressive cultural atmosphere and the banning of avant-garde activities by the government, he cut off his left pinky in an act of despair and buried it in a flower pot filled with Chinese soil. Although his body would travel abroad, a part of his soul would, thus, still be rooted in China, the country he deeply loved. He spent time in Europe earning a Master's degree from London's St. Martins College of Art and Design and returned to Beijing in 1998.These two works are part of the series called Memories in which he takes old family photos and images from newspaper reports, reduces them in size and shows them in front of his mutilated hand. One is a childhood picture of himself taken during the Cultural Revolution, the other of Mao from the same period. While his damaged hand commemorates the June Fourth Movement, the small black and white photos are rememberances of the past associated with his childhood.

Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Gathering,Wang Yunwu,dated 1964,"Wang Yunwu made significant contributions to publishing, library science, and education reform in twentieth century China. He was also a capable calligrapher, as his transcription of Wang Xizhi's (303C361) ""Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Gathering"" here demonstrates. Revered by calligraphers as the greatest work in running script, this legendary text was composed by Wang on the third day of the third lunar month in 353, when forty-one eminent men of letters gathered at the Orchid Pavilion, a scenic site near Wang's hometown of Shanyin in northern Zhejiang, to perform the customary purification ritual held on that day. During the celebration, all the participants composed poems, and Wang brushed his famous preface. Half inebriated, he created a calligraphic masterpiece so extraordinary that even he could never equal it.Wang Xizhi's ""Preface"" has also been widely admired for its literary finesse and depth of feeling. Lin Yutang translated the entire text in his The Importance of Living (1937), praising it for embodying a very Chinese response to the ""evanescence of life.""

Family Tree,Zhang Huan,2001,"With Family Tree, made less than two years after his move to New York, Zhang offered his face as a surface on which words, names, and stories connected to his cultural heritage are, literally, written. This performance piece is documented in nine photographs that record the gradual obscuring of Zhang’s face with inked words until it is completely blackened. Most words derive from the ancient Chinese art of physiognomy, which seeks to map personality traits and divine the future based on one’s facial features. But rather than elucidating Zhang’s character and fate, these traditional divinatory marks ultimately obscure his identity beneath a dense layer of culturally conditioned references.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/IA.ZhangH.1.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/631073

Vegetable #3,Li Jin,2015,"This is an image of the humble Chinese cabbage (bok choy or bai cai) magnified to heroic scale, some six feet tall. The tips of the leaves were painted in broad, gestural lines of wet, black ink that has bled in an uncontrolled manner into the absorbent xuan paper, leaving both the original line and a penumbra of saturation around it. To this, the artist has added wet washes of dark ink that have mottled and pooled irregularly on the surface of the leaves. The white base of the vegetable has been left mostly in reserve, with a moderate amount of light side-brush texturing. The roots of the bok choy, still attached, are rendered in dark washes of ink. The painting has been backed with several layers of xuan paper and mounted to a wooden frame.A tradition of vegetable painting―especially in monochrome ink―dates back at least to the thirteenth century in China. One strain is allegorical, the vegetables standing in for the righteous Confucian scholar beset by petty adversaries. The second has a Chan (J. Zen) Buddhist connotation, the focus on such a mundane subject operating as an emblem of the Buddhist practitioner’s insistence on the centrality of the mundane everyday, in which true enlightenment may be found. Li Jin, who has had a lifelong affinity for Buddhism, seems to be referring to the latter strain, though the formal qualities of the painting show awareness of the former as well. To these connotations, he adds the puckishness of Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen’s sculptures, in which a kind of ironic profundity is achieved through the simple act of magnification.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-16218-016.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/776714

My Left Hand (Mao),Sheng Qi,2000,"Sheng Qi was one of the early pioneers in the body work and performance art movements in China. He fled the country after the suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, for Europe and a period of self-exile. Disgusted with the oppressive cultural atmosphere and the banning of avant-garde activities by the government, he cut off his left pinky in an act of despair and buried it in a flower pot filled with Chinese soil. Although his body would travel abroad, a part of his soul would, thus, still be rooted in China, the country he deeply loved. He spent time in Europe earning a Master's degree from London's St. Martins College of Art and Design and returned to Beijing in 1998.These two works are part of the series called Memories in which he takes old family photos and images from newspaper reports, reduces them in size and shows them in front of his mutilated hand. One is a childhood picture of himself taken during the Cultural Revolution, the other of Mao from the same period. While his damaged hand commemorates the June Fourth Movement, the small black and white photos are rememberances of the past associated with his childhood. They are powerful and disturbing images juxtaposing pain and sadness with idealized pictures from another time.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ph/mobile-large/DP-30122-047.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/291670
Ten Thousand Valleys in Deep Shade,Huang Binhong,dated 1933,"Huang Binhong was born into a family of scholars and artists in Shexian, Anhui Province. He expressed his anti-Qing sentiments in literati fashion by organizing a local club to honor a seventeenth-century scholar who had defied the corrupt government of his time. When a warrant was issued for his arrest, Huang fled to Shanghai, where he worked as an editor of art books and magazines and gained exposure to the private collections scattered throughout the area. In the 1930s he helped examine the palace collection in Beijing in order to prepare it for dispersal prior to the impending Japanese invasion.This painting, inspired by the brush idiom of the tenth-century monumental landscapist Juran, was executed while Huang was traveling in Sichuan. The dense shade of the trees and flowers covers the many mountains.The shadow of these [mountains, coiled like] dark green snails, oozes into the stream.A few forsaken leaves are turning red and yellow.It is easy for autumn to come to Baidi City because of its altitude.(Robert H.

Zhong Kui Carrying a Sword,Fan Zeng,Datable to 1979,"After graduating from college with a degree in history, Fan Zeng studied art history and painting at Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts. He went on to work at the National Museum of Chinese History before becoming chairman of the Oriental Culture Department of Nankai University in Tianjin. As a painter Fan specializes in figural subjects, particularly historical personages, rendered in a dashing style that combines sketchy brushwork with acutely observed naturalistic detail.Zhong Kui, the legendary demon queller, was often portrayed in humorous situations, but Fan Zeng chose to depict him as a heroic figure wearing a sword. Painted about the time that posters advocating greater personal freedom began to appear on ""Democracy Wall"" in Beijing, Fan's bold image may refer to the fall of the Gang of Four and the expunging of other ""demons"" responsible for the chaos of the Cultural Revolution (1966-76).The political sensitivity of Fan's painting is underscored by Huang Miaozi's powerfully brushed but circumspect inscription, which reads, in part:""Earlier artists loved to paint Zhong Kui because the old boy was good for a laugh. . . . After Fan [Zeng] did this painting [of Zhong Kui] holding a sword he asked me what I would inscribe [on it]. I said, 'Only [Zhong Kui] in his gut knows.'""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-33364-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36429

Old Pine Shrouded in Clouds,Zeng Xi,dated 1922,"Zeng Xi, from Hengyang, Hunan Province, passed the palace (jinshi) examination in 1903. He served in the Qing court until the Revolution of 1911, when he moved to Shanghai. He established himself as a leading calligrapher and painter and became a close friend of Li Ruiqing (1867C1920).Zeng painted this image after Li Ruiqing's death to present to Ruiqing's nephew Li Jian (1881C1956). His dedication reads:An ancient pine tree, having turned into a dragon, displays shining claws in the cloudy firmament. A branch stemming from the same root and luxuriantly green, is auspicious in its burgeoning youth. I painted this as a metaphor for his nephew Li Jian, who has inherited his uncle Ruiqing's [artistic] family legacy. Like the clouds encircling the [pine tree's] roots and branches, the rain and dew will nurture their growth. Jian will pass on what he learned [from Ruiqing] to educate future generations.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H.

Response to Mi Fu's Poem Written in a Boat on the Wu River,Fung Ming Chip,2013,"Fung Ming Chip is one of the most innovative practitioners of Chinese calligraphy working today. Inspired by but not limited to the classical canon, Fung constantly seeks new ways to invigorate old forms, and he has spent the last two decades creating novel scripts, some of which deliberately defy the dictates of legibility and push close to abstract art.The current work is among Fung’s more traditional, because it takes as its explicit inspiration a classical work of art―Mi Fu’s calligraphy Poem Written in a Boat on the Wu River. Since its gift to the Met by John Crawford in 1984, this has been one of the Museum’s signature works of Chinese art, a masterpiece known to Chinese calligraphy enthusiasts the world over (1984.174). Datable to around 1100, Poem Written in a Boat on the Wu River demonstrates Mi Fu’s epochal achievement in calligraphy, for it shows him riding the line between historically informed elegance and strategic imbalance, a delicate dance that only a calligrapher of Mi’s brilliance could successfully manage. Since the Northern Song dynasty (960C1127), Mi Fu has been a source of both inspiration and intimidation to calligraphers.Faced with the daunting task of responding to such a work, Fung departed somewhat from his more typical working mode, in which he uses the hanging scroll format to create striking, iconic images that are meant to address the viewer from the wall. Following the format of Mi Fu’s piece, Fung wrote his response on a handscroll, creating a more intimate object that is meant to be read on a table, one section at a time. Fung adhered to Mi Fu’s overall lineation and composition, and he took care to make the work more legible than much of his nearly abstract calligraphy, honoring the text of the original. But he also injected his own voice. For instance, he uses a whimsical self-created form for the character meaning “wind” (feng L), while using archaic forms for other characters, including “five” (wu 五). In one section, Fung highlights the coincidental repetition of characters featuring two visually similar components (jian  and mu 目) in Mi’s poem; by foregrounding this repetition, he creates a whimsical and almost childlike space within the scroll.Fung’s voice comes out most strongly in his long inscription at the end of Mi Fu’s poem. Here, Fung departs for the first time from Mi’s compositional structure to lay the characters on the paper according to his own fancy. He clusters the characters on the lower two-thirds of the scroll, building a composition almost like a mountain range out of the words. His meditation on the role of brush-written calligraphy in contemporary life reveals a concern that animates his entire oeuvre.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-13266-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/649042
Letter to Nancun,Wang Chong,未知年代,"Wang Chong was a prodigy who died young; his death shocked the scholarly community of Suzhou, especially his mentor Wen Zhengming, who continued to mourn him many years later. Wang writes here in a relaxed semicursive script, which allowed him to lift the brush less frequently than in formal standard script. As a result, many strokes and even characters are connected with fine ligatures.

The Poetic Mood of Su Shi,Li Keran,dated 1962,"According to the artist's inscription, this painting was done when Li Keran and his students were painting landscapes in Guilin. It shows the great statesman, poet, and artist Su Shi (1036C1101) in a moment of reverie. Su was exiled several times for expressing his political views, but he used these periods for self-cultivation and created some of his most moving poetry and calligraphy. Li captured Su beside a lotus-filled pond. The dark lotus appear almost threatening, as if they are about to engulf the figure, who nevertheless sits quietly, facing the blossoms. The artist's inscription, taken from a poem by Su Shi, reads:Lotus leaves reach up to the sky,endlessly green.In the sun's reflection they turn abrilliant red.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H.

Junks,Gao Jianfu,dated 1945,"In 1936 Gao Jianfu accepted a professorship at the National Central University in Nanjing, but with the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war in 1937 he fled with his family to Macao. After the war Gao returned to Canton, where he continued teaching at his own painting studio. During his long absence, however, his style had become less influential and was criticized for having too much ""Japanese flavor."" Following the Communist revolution of 1949, Gao again went to Macao, where he died.Junks, dated October 15, 1945―five days after the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China-presents an introspective image of traditional Chinese fishing boats. The vessels are headed toward a lightening horizon, but their destination―like that of Gao and China itself―is out of sight. With its low horizon line, impressionistic handling of color, and light-suffused atmosphere, the painting reflects Gao's fascination with the representational and coloristic effects of Western painting as well as his faith in an artistic synthesis of Eastern and Western styles.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-30746-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36256
Buddha Maitreya (Mile),China,dated 486 (10th year of Taihe reign),"This is the largest early gilt-bronze Chinese sculpture known today. The Buddha’s broad shoulders, powerful physique, and long legs derive from fifth century Indian prototypes that spread to China along the Silk Road, an example of which can be seen directly behind you in the gallery for Indian art.Maitreya is worshiped both as a bodhisattva and as a Buddha, for it is believed that once the current cosmic era has destroyed itself, he will be reborn as the teaching Buddha of the next great era. The identification of this figure as the Buddha Maitreya is based on the dedicatory inscription at the back of the base, which dates the sculpture to 486 and states that it was commissioned in honor of the dowager empress Wenming (442C490), who controlled the Northern Wei dynasty during the last three decades of the fifth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP170102.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42733
Stately Pines on Mount Hua,Shi Lu,early 1970s,"Having openly criticized the Gang of Four in 1969, Shi Lu took refuge in the wilderness near Xi'an. After a year he sought asylum in the hospital where he had been treated earlier for schizophrenia and alcoholism.In the early 1970s his compositions were distilled to a new clarity. His highly individual technique of pushing the brush like a carver's tool became more expressive. He repeatedly found inspiration in China's sacred western peak Mount Hua, whose name is synonymous with the enduring character of both the landscape and the nation. The theme of Shi Lu's poem is noble spirits persevering in the face of adversity:I love the many pines on Mount Hua,Tall, noble, and dignified,Their trunks climbing skyward to compete with the sunand moon.Weathering the bitter winds,Shaking their branches, they reach for the border of heaven.Bestride blue dragons, they hold their heads aloft.Lifting the clouds they stand.Ceaselessly they push against the sky.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H.

Man on a Bridge,Ren Yi (Ren Bonian),dated 1889,"Ren Yi, like his contemporary and friend Xugu (1823C1896), experimented with the realistic rendering of natural scenery instead of producing traditional landscapes composed of conventional compositions and brushstroke formulas. Here, he used irregular patches of wash and hatching to convey the impression of naked branches. Ren approached the picture as a Western artist sketching nature might have, asking ""How can I render what I see?"" rather than attempting to imitate Western art.Photographs, regularly published in newspapers and magazines in Shanghai as early as the 1870s, shattered traditional Chinese concepts of picture making and had more to do with changing attitudes in landscape painting in the late nineteenth century than any direct influence of Western art.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-30285-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49462

Mushrooms,Zhang Daqian,dated 1965,"This delightful scroll is one of several paintings that Zhang Daqian painted for Lin Yutang in the summer of 1965. It features a group of mushrooms depicted in profile or from below. Zhang's humble vantage point elevates this mundane subject to something worthy ofaesthetic appreciation. The sharp blades of grass around the mushrooms indicate that they are growing in the wild. Zhang Daqian's ""ink play"" not only engages the viewer with its spontaneity, but also reveals something very personal. Zhang was a most discriminatingconnoisseur of Chinese cuisine and a chef of the first rank. One of the ingredients that he valued most was mushrooms, as confirmed by his inscription, where he shows off his knowledge of their regional variety:In Nanzhao [Yunnan province] there are jizong [mushrooms]; in the north there are koumo. Those from my homeland are so rich in flavor. Lately my hunger for them is insatiable, but what can I do except build my dreams with songrong [matsutake mushrooms]? The jizong from southern Yunnan and [koumo] from Zhangjiakou [in Hebei province] are two of the best ingredients for cooking. Others, such as the sanpa of Sichuan, the majun of Hunan, the lanhua of West River [in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces], and the songhua of Gaolan [Lanzhou, Gansu province], are also top choices. None of them can be acquired now. Only the songrong mushrooms from Japan can barely match them.

Lotus,Zhang Daqian,dated 1946,"Zhang Daqian's mother taught him to paint flowers when he was a child. At the age of nineteen he left his native Sichuan Province and went to Kyoto to study textile weaving and dyeing. When he returned to China in 1919, he lived in Shanghai and Suzhou, where he immersed himself in the study of traditional painting. Between 1940 and 1943 he studied, catalogued, and made copies of the brilliantly colored wall paintings of the Buddhist cave temples, mostly fifth to tenth century, in the western oasis of Dunhuang.This painting epitomizes Zhang's ability to synthesize diverse stylistic sources. The bold ink-wash lotus leaves reveal his early fascination with the expressive style of Bada Shanren (1626C1705); the descriptive treatment of the blossoms and water plants reflects his mastery of academic bird-and-flower painting; the vivid palette and ink washes suffused with blurry highlights of red and green reveal his familiarity with the Japanese artists of the Nihonga school. Zhang's inscription suggests that he was inspired by the visions of paradise at Dunhuang. Stylistically, however, this image has nothing to do with early models; instead, its sumptuous style comes closest to the decorative imagery of modern Japanese flower paintings:Blue, yellow, red, and white express [Buddha's] infinite benevolence.I offer these lotuses as Buddha's manifestation of joyfulness.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H.

Seventeen Letters,Xu Beihong,dated 1938C48,"This handscroll consists of seventeen letters written by Xu Beihong between 1938 and 1948. The first fifteen were written to Lin Yutang, and the last two to Lin's daughter Taiyi. The letters remained separate sheets until the 1980s, when Lin Taiyi had them remounted chronologically as a handscroll.The letters exemplify Xu Beihong's distinct calligraphic style, which is angular and tense with no concern for charm. More importantly, they document early attempts at cultural exchange between China and the United States, as Xu enlisted Lin Yutang's assistance in organizing a touring exhibition of contemporary Chinese art in America to gain support for China during the Sino-Japanese War (1937C45).Xu Beihong may have come up with this ambitious plan with Lin Yutang in mind. Lin moved to New York in 1936. After the publication of two widely acclaimed best sellers, by 1938 Lin's influence and connections had made him China's unofficial cultural ambassador. In addition, he was an outspoken critic of Japanese militarism. Xu also suggested that Lin Yutang involve his close friends Pearl Buck (1892C1973) and her husband Richard Walsh in planning the proposed exhibition. The majority of the letters chronicle in detail Xu's preparations for his trip to the U.S. Plans were finalized for him to leave Singapore for San Francisco on December 6, 1941.

Poem,Gao Fenghan,1744,"清 高P翰 卷Partial paralysis forced Gao Fenghan to switch midcareer from writing with his right hand to his left hand. While the right-handed work of his youth is elegant and somewhat conservative, his mature left-handed work, as seen here, is free and bold, full of unconventional character structures and wavering lines. Eighteenth-century Yangzhou was highly tolerant of eccentricity, and Gao’s late work was well received there. Gao was also a painter, and, on this scroll, the combination of word and image is a powerful statement of the close relationship between these two arts in Chinese culture.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/EX 2012.2.010_06_edt.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78836

The Immortal Liu Haichan Playing with a Toad,Li Keran,dated 1937,"Born to impoverished and illiterate parents in Jiangsu Province, Li Keran began studying painting at the age of thirteen. In the 1920s he studied both traditional and Western-style art with Liu Haisu (1896C1994) and Lin Fengmian (1900C1991). In 1946 Xu Beihong (1895C1953) recommended Li for a post at the Beijing National Art College, where faculty members Qi Baishi (1864C1957) and Huang Binhong (1865C1955) encouraged him to pursue traditional painting.This work is an early example of Li's interest in ancient Chinese figure painting. It depicts Liu Haichan (""Liu Sea Toad""), a minister during the tumultuous Five Dynasties era (906C960) who renounced his titles and became a recluse. By Ming times Liu was venerated as an immortal and was always depicted unkempt, unshod, and carrying a three-legged toad.This bold image reflects Li's familiarity with popular New Year's prints and woodblock images as well as with the uninhibited brushwork and spontaneous inkwash style of Liang Kai (act. ca. 1200C1250), a member of the Song Imperial Painting Academy who relinquished his position to become a Chan (Zen) Buddhist monk.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-31976-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49747
Jietai Temple,Lu Yanshao,dated 1978,"Trained in traditional-style landscape painting, Lu Yanshao found no place for his elitist art after the Communist Liberation in 1949 and was forced to work in a government shop in Shanghai that made cartoons and comic strips. Labeled a rightist during the Cultural Revolution, Lu was denied the right to paint from 1968 to 1978.This painting was done the year that the charges against Lu were revoked. Recording the pleasures of travel, it celebrates the strangely contorted ever-greens growing around two of the scenic temples near Beijing. The animated trees, unrestrained by the walled courtyard, reach beyond the confines of the temple precinct to interact with their counter-parts in the landscape beyond. The artist's inscription reads:In the spring of 1978, I was in the capital and traveled to the temples Tanzhe and Jietai. Ancient pines and junipers rose in a strange and archaic manner, something I had never seen before. After I returned to the south, comrade Chen Yi asked about the sights in the capital, so I painted this to win his smile.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H.

Flowers,Huang Binhong,early 1940s,"Painted late in Huang Binhong's long life, this album reflects his mastery of traditional Chinese flower painting. In each leaf, Huang explores a different flower as well as different styles of painting them-from the outline style of his tree peony, to the ""boneless"" method (using washes with no defining contour strokes) of his herbaceous peonies. The last leaf―a hibiscus―shows a combination of line and wash that epitomizes his style. In spite of the coloristic opportunities afforded by an album of flowers, Huang's use of the same few colors over and over demonstrates that his principal concern was not representational or decorative but was the stylistic language of the genre.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP162543_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49642

This fan bears neither signature nor seal, yet the writing is distinctly Zhu's. The characters are densely packed without clearly distinguished columns, adding a pictorial dimension to the writing.

Discourse on Poetry,Gao Jian,1698,"Gardens were often designed to embody the ideals of their owners. Paintings of gardens could take even greater license in conveying a man’s character by constructing symbols and metaphors drawn from elements of the natural environment. That is surely the case with this painting by the Suzhou artist Gao Jian.The painting was made to accompany a treatise on Chinese poetry by the renowned scholar-official and collector Song Luo (1634C1713). In it, Gao presents an idealized evocation of Song composing his discourse in a garden pavilion. Rejecting bright color and representational verisimilitude, Gao renders his simplified, almost naive vision of the garden in a spare, “dry brush” monochrome style that emphasizes the painting’s role as a “portrait” rather than a literal description of the scholar’s surroundings. The majestic pines, dense grove of bamboo, and tranquil lotus pond may all be read as metaphors for Song’s lofty character, moral virtue, and detached state of mind.The sparse foreground and meticulous brushwork exemplify the Suzhou School of painting, from which Gao derived his style. Framed by a bold seal-script frontispiece and Song’s treatise, transcribed in formal standard-script calligraphy by Song’s son, the scroll unites poetry, painting, and calligraphy in a quintessential work of early Qing literati culture.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP214835_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/74818
Narcissus,Zhao Mengjian,mid-13th century,"Zhao Mengjian, a member of the Song imperial family and an accomplished scholar and calligrapher, specialized in painting narcissi and raised the flower to the level of the orchid in the esteem of scholars. Offering the promise of spring, the narcissus is known in Chinese as the ""water goddess"" (shuixian) or the ""goddess who stands above the waves"" (lingbo xianzi). The fragrant blossoms are associated with the two goddesses of the Xiang River and, by extension, with Qu Yuan (343C277 b.c.), author of Li Sao (On Encountering Sorrow). Qu Yuan, a loyal minister of the state of Chu, drowned himself in a tributary of the Xiang River after failing to alert his prince of the imminent danger threatening the state.In a poem appended to the scroll after the Mongol conquest, the Song loyalist Qiu Yuan (1247Cafter 1327) describes Zhao's narcissi as the only vision of life in an otherwise devastated land:The shiny bronze dish is upset,and the immortals' dew spilled;The bright jade cup is smashed,like broken coral.I pity the narcissus for not beingthe orchid.Which at least had known thesober minister from Chu.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP151496.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40284
Portrait of the wife of Yizhai,Ruan Zude,datable to 1561 or 1620,"This image of an elegant elderly lady shows how the Chinese portrait painter conveyed a sense of status through a figure's accoutrements. The lady's wealth is suggested by her jewelry (gold-and-pearl earrings and an ornate headdress fashioned out of gold and kingfisher feathers), by her sumptuous outer robe of blue brocade and white underrobe fastened at the neck by gold clasps, and by the red-and-gold brocaded cloth draped over the back of her chair. Her family status is further underscored by the official belt inset with elaborately worked plaques and the large rank badge with Manchurian cranes―the insignia of a civil official of the highest rank. Since women were not eligible to hold government office, these marks of rank were probably inherited from her father.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-15981-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36082
Peach Blossoms and Peony,Zhao Zhiqian,ca. 1860,"The preeminent literati artist of his day, Zhao Zhiqian applied his skills as a calligrapher and seal carver to the art of painting. His blending of contrasting compositional and graphic effects―positive forms and negative spaces, dry and wet ink, round and angular movements, heavy and light brushwork―derive from his calligraphic training; for this reason, Zhao's painting style, often referred to as ""epigraphic,"" inaugurated a new direction for traditional Chinese artists.The relationship of figure to ground, which is at the heart of seal carving, is seen here in Zhao's bold juxtaposition of the solidly colored peach blossoms and the monochrome peony, which are executed in the two traditional modes of flower painting: the ""boneless"" method of drawing in color without ink contours and the monochrome outline method. The pinwheel effect of Zhao's swirling cluster of blossoms is held in check by his compact inscription, which counterbalances the expansive leftward thrust of the peony. Zhao states that he is following the brush style of Wang Wu (1632C1690), but his mix of lush imagery and calligraphic techniques is quintessentially nineteenth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP161402.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49452
The Classic of Filial Piety,Li Gonglin,ca. 1085,"Song scholar-artists believed that painting was not just a record of sensory experience but also a reflection of the artist's mind, a revelation of his personality, and an expression of deeply held values. In giving form to this ideal, Li Gonglin fundamentally transformed Chinese art. Prior to Li's time, painting served a public function: it was primarily decorative or didactic in intent. With Li, painting joined music, poetry, and calligraphy as a medium of self-expression. Li's revolutionary new style established the three essential desiderata of scholar-painting: moral purpose, learned stylistic references to the past, and expressive calligraphic brushwork.The Classic of Filial Piety, composed between 350 and 200 B.C., teaches a simple but all-embracing lesson: beginning humbly at home, filial piety not only ensures success in a man's life but also brings peace and harmony to the world at large. During the Song dynasty, the text became one of the thirteen classics of the Neo-Confucian canon and remained a cornerstone of traditional Chinese moral teaching until modern times.Purposefully restrained and without the decorative appeal of color, Li's paintings alternate with his transcriptions of brief chapters from the Classic. The images do more than illustrate the text; using his art to criticize, exhort, and subvert, Li presents subtle commentaries on the Classic's moral relevance to the Song world. Like the paintings, the calligraphy is executed in an archaic style instantly recognizable to the connoisseur as a sophisticated plea for a return to simple virtues and plain-living rectitude.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP151528.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39895

Orchid and Rock,Shi Lu,20th century,"This fine painting represents the triumph of modern Chinese painting over both the deadwood of orthodoxy and infatuations with the exotic that would have severed it from its cultural roots. The artist's painting, calligraphy and seal are individual, fresh and nourished by tradition. Shi Lu took the surname Shi because of his admiration for Shitao, the 17th century monk-painter whose style is invoked in the orchid and rock. The calligraphy of Shi Lu's signature, with its display of resistance as brush, paper and the artist's will engage, sums up the fascination among 19th and 20th century intellectuals for carved scripts. The complete circle from seals to carved scripts to painting that transpired in the 19th and 20th centuries is reenacted in his highly graphic seal, which is not an impression, but a painted image.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-31962-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39716

The foremost calligrapher of the early Ming, Song Ke based both his cursive and his regular scripts on those of Zhao Mengfu (1254C1322). This scroll probably dates to near the end of the Yuan dynasty (1279C1368). It is executed in sharp, incisive thrusts and powerful curves that evoke Song's martial spirit, and its mixture of cursive and draft-cursive styles recalls the writing of two of Zhao Mengfu's early followers: Kangli Naonao (1295C1345) and Rao Jie (ca. 1300C1367).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP204660_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45657

In the 1930s, he turned to traditional Chinese media as did many artists, but he has continued to paint in oils as well over his long career.This fan painting is an example of Liu's enduring interest in the landscapes of South China, here rendered in traditional medium and style.

A number of the leaves openly celebrate the 1976 downfall of Jiang Qing, Mao Zedong's notorious wife and leader of the Gang of Four, which strictly controlled culture.

The round seal showing the trigram qian (""Heaven""), used only by the emperor, confirms its imperial pedigree. The poem, though composed by Meng Haoran (689C740), perfectly describes the kind of atmospheric qualities that thirteenth-century painters, such as Ma Lin and Liang Kai, sought to evoke pictorially:In the Chan meditation hall, on the mountaintop, hangs a priest's robe.There is no one outside the window, only birds flying by a stream.As dusk half envelops the mountain path,I hear the bells toll over the endless greenery.(Wen C.

Playing weiqi in a waterside pavilion,Fu Baoshi,mid-1940s,"Between 1933 and 1935 Fu Baoshi studied painting in Japan, where he developed notions of a new national painting style based on a fusion of Western realism and traditional brushwork. After his return to China, Fu taught at the National Central University in Nanjing.This large painting was done between 1940 and 1946, when Fu lived in Sichuan. The garden pavilion buttressed by powerful rocks next to a rushing stream may refer to Fu's personal retreat as identified in his inscription: ""The Mountain Studio at the foot of Mount Jin'gang in Eastern Sichuan."" It may also be understood as a metaphor for China's enduring culture. The two scholars at weiqi (go, in Japanese) recall the four traditional accomplishments of the gentleman―weiqi, playing the zither, calligraphy, and painting―but they may also allude to China's history of military strategy.The composition, framed top and bottom by forms rendered in saturated daubs of black ink, presents a shallow space packed with richly colored garden elements. Only the freestanding screen in the pavilion remains unpainted, serving as a bold accent that throws the figures into high relief, accentuating the stagelike drama. Fu's combination of Chinese and foreign painting methods is evident in his treatment of the stream, which is delineated with dry-brush contours and alternating passages of wash and uninked paper that suggest the play of sunlight across the surface-a treatment borrowed from Western watercolor techniques.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36427-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44568

Wang's brush moves at different speeds, often slowing down to change direction and giving his well-articulated characters a sense of restrained energy that also recalls the writing of Mi Fu (1052C1107).

Snow over the Waterside Village,Wu Jide,1988,"In the post-Mao era the landscape of Zhejiang Province became a major theme for printmakers attempting to recover traditional culture by asserting local identity. Wu Jide, a major exponent of this movement, produced a set of twenty-two prints of carefully observed local scenes and customs for a children’s book entitled Plum Rain, published in 1989.

Poem in Cursive Script,Kuang Lu,17th century,"Kuang Lu wrote this poem to commemorate an outing to the mountains with four friends on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month―the Double Ninth Festival. On this day custom dictates that people ascend the heights to enjoy the view. Apart from vivid descriptions of natural scenery and musing over the passage of time, he mentions the no-longer-occupied Weiyuan Constellation, the realm of the Jade Emperor. This allusion to the demise of the Ming emperor dates this calligraphy to the final years of Kuang’s life.Written in wild-cursive script, this work pushes the graphic potential of Chinese characters to the utmost. Twisting ink filaments link separate strokes and adjacent characters in dynamic configurations. Columnar integrity is willfully and creatively compromised to draw attention to the pictorial quality of this linear composition as a masterpiece of abstract art.cat. no. 33",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_33_d3.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76506

Ten Kings of Hell,Jin Chushi,before 1195,"This is one from a set of scrolls (30.76.290C.294) illustrating the theme of the Ten Kings of Hell, which developed during the second half of the Tang dynasty (618C907). The theme transforms the Indian Buddhist view of judgment after death into a typically Chinese bureaucratic process. Before being permitted to transmigrate into the next life, a soul is tried by a different king each week for seven weeks; it is sent to the eighth king on the hundredth day, to the ninth after a year, and to the tenth the third year after death. Here, each scroll shows a king―assisted by a scribe and other officials―examining and passing sentence on the souls of the dead; in the foreground demons punish the wicked..Most extant Song and Yuan dynasty Buddhist paintings were preserved in Japan; many had been taken there from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, an important port city for Japanese merchants and pilgrims. Inscriptions on the present paintings state that they were made in the studio of Jin Chushi, a Buddhist layman in Mingzhou, the name for Ningbo before it was changed to Qingyuanfu in 1195; the paintings, therefore, must date prior to that year. Stylistically, they are extremely close to The Five Hundred Luohans in the Zen Buddhist temple Daitokuji, Kyoto, which were also made in Ningbo and are dated 1178. The vivid drawing and the intense colors of these works are typical of the best Buddhist narrative paintings of the period.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP213571.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44509

Wang developed this method of “writing” after he accidentally dropped ash onto paper while lighting a cigarette in his studio and observed the resulting perforations. For him, the process resembles that of “burning” information onto digital drives―hence the title of the series. Wang’s layering of ink and paper obscures the individual characters, yet the vivid physical traces of the artist’s hand assert the primacy of the creative process and the object’s materiality, reminding us that much of Chinese culture is preserved through a medium that is inherently fragile and vulnerable, and that our grasp of past traditions is similarly elusive.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/SL_14_2013_3_1a-c_O.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73327

Letter,Wang Zhideng,未知年代,"A child prodigy, Wang Zhideng could do large character calligraphy at the age of six and compose poetry at ten. Best known for his monumental clerical or seal-script frontispieces for handscrolls, he wrote this letter to a friend in the more informal running-cursive script. In the letter, Wang relates that he has fulfilled the friend's request for a colophon to enhance the appeal of a certain scroll and, in addition, was presenting him with a gift of six carp to help him recover from illness. Wang's affection for his friend is underscored by the fact that he wrote this letter in the freezing cold on a snowy day when he was ill himself.Wang, who spent most of his life in Suzhou, here follows the calligraphic style of Wen Zhengming (1470C1559), the influential leader of Suzhou's artistic circle of two generations earlier. Wang's characters are tall and slightly pinched. Lacking the strength and bold rhythmic gestures of his model, his brushwork nonetheless impresses the viewer with its graceful ease and natural finesse as evident in the gentle fluctuations of the individual strokes. In addition to the speed and casualness of the writing, Wang's illness may also explain certain cursoriness in its execution.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153907.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/48927
Yang Guifei with a Parrot,Zhang Daqian,dated 1946,"Zhang Daqian's facility as a figure painter, improved by years of studying early scroll paintings and the murals at Dunhuang, is demonstrated in this depiction of the infamous consort of the eighth-century Tang emperor Xuanzong. The portrayal is an eclectic mix of sources and styles. Yang Guifei's elaborate coiffure recalls Tang models; her costume and the animated brushwork that defines her fluttering scarves and swirling hem derive from sixteenth-century prototypes; and her coquettish expression and theatrical pose recall cinematic images of contemporary beauties.Zhang's lithe brushwork and facile rendering of Yang Guifei's complex stance infuse her figure with immediacy and drama. Her relationship with her pet is emphasized by their eye contact and by the juxtaposition of the parrot with the phoenix ornamenting her coiffure. Zhang's inscription elucidates their conspiratorial connection:During the Tianbao era [742C55], the provincial governor of Lingnan presented the emperor with a white parrot of exceptional intelligence, which the emperor and [his consort] Yang Guifei named Girl in a Dress of Snow. The emperor often played dice with his concubines and princes. When the emperor was winning, everyone would cheer and the parrot would fly into the middle of the game to break it up.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H.

Portrait of a man in court robes with fur surcoat,Unidentified artist,late 18thCearly 19th century,"This portrait depicts a middle-aged man in court robes topped by a sumptuous fur coat. Building on both Chinese and European precedents, the artist shaded the face to suggest three-dimensional volume; the glistening white dot in the eye, suggesting moistness, is a purely European convention adopted by the artist during a time when images from abroad were becoming more widely available in China. The man sits before a screen painted with a floral rebus, or multipart visual pun: magnolia (yulan 玉m), crab apple (haitang 海棠), and peony (nicknamed fugui 富F) combine to mean “fortune in the jade hall” (yutang fugui 玉堂富F), a wish for riches and honor. With such an auspicious background, this portrait was likely made for a milestone birthday; after the death of the sitter, it could have been repurposed for veneration in the ancestral shrine.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-23111-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/854220

Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao Entering the Tiantai Mountains,Zhao Cangyun,未知年代,"Painted by a member of the Song royal family who lived through the Mongol conquest, this handscroll, which revives the monochrome drawing style of the scholar-artist Li Gonglin (ca. 1041C1106), chronicles the legend of two men of the Han dynasty who stumble upon a magical realm of immortals. Returning home after what seemed like half a year, they discover that seven generations have come and gone and that they are alone in the world. The men’s loss of home and paradise evokes the disorientation and alienation felt by many of the Chinese elite following the fall of the Song dynasty in 1279.What little we know of the artist is contained in the colophons mounted after the painting. The first, by Hua Youwu (1307Cafter 1386), describes Zhao Cangyun as an artist known for “boneless” (without outlines) ink-wash landscapes and delicate figure paintings. Hua also states that the artist was more famous in his youth than his fellow clansmen Zhao Mengjian (1199Cbefore 1267) and Zhao Mengfu (1254C1322).

Giraffe with Two Keepers,Unidentified artist,未知年代,"In 1414, a giraffe―a creature unknown in China at the time―was presented to the Yongle emperor (r. 1403C24) from the king of Bengal, which was a major trading center on the maritime route between the Arabian Peninsula and China. The Chinese immediately associated it with the qilin, an auspicious mythical creature. As a qilin only appears during the rule of a sagacious ruler, courtiers composed a number of sycophantic encomia celebrating the arrival of the giraffe as an omen that legitimized the reign of the Yongle emperor, who had usurped the throne. The many nearly identical paintings commemorating this event attest to the impact of this gift on the court. The giraffe also influenced the design of the qilin rank badge used for nobles.The giraffe's arrival in China was occasioned by the extraordinary naval expeditions of Admiral Zheng He (1371C1433). Between 1405 and 1433, he commanded seven expeditions, the largest consisting of more than three hundred ships and 37,000 sailors, that reached as far as the east coast of Africa and established China's prestige throughout the region. The giraffe became an emblem of the Yongle emperor's diplomatic success. In this late version of the painting, a celebratory inscription by Shen Du (1357C1434) has been omitted, the giraffe has been given a geometric pattern of hexagonal spots, and central Asian grooms have been substituted for the original South Asian keepers.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP162877.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/51649

Pines and Rock,Huang Daozhou,dated 1634,"Due to repeated setbacks, Huang Daozhou held office for fewer than five years during his official twenty-two-year-long civil-service career. However, the enormous energy he expended on scholarship and teaching made him a very influential figure in Chinese intellectual history. He painted this scroll for his friend and disciple Zhang Ruizhong (active mid-17th century) during a long interval between engagements when giving a series of lectures in and around his hometown of Zhangpu, in southern Fujian.Although Huang painted both landscapes and figures, he is most admired for his depictions of pines and rocks―traditional symbols of perseverance and constancy, and motifs that have long invited expressionist interpretations by calligraphers like Huang. This unusually long and narrow painting presents a pair of towering pines mysteriously encircled by the twisting branches of a third tree at the bottom. A vertical craggy rock, though barely visible to the left, is the subject of Huang’s inscription: “Even if turned into a rock, I wouldn’t be obstinate.” Among Huang’s scholastic strengths is his profound understanding of the Book of Changes, which is wittily epitomized in this line.cat. no. 8",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_08.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76481
The Lotus Sutra,Zhao Mengfu,ca. 1315,"元 w孟\ 小楷大乘妙法A卷第三 卷 本Zhao Mengfu was a pivotal figure in the history of Chinese painting and calligraphy, so much so that, after his death, the standard typeface for printed books was modeled on his calligraphy. A versatile master of all five calligraphic script types, he made a vital contribution to the revival of small standard script. Because it follows strict rules of stroke order and structure, standard script allows for less personal expressiveness than cursive and semicursive scripts. Nevertheless, Zhao managed to forge a unique voice with standard script through a singular combination of structural balance and smooth brushwork. This rare example of Zhao’s small standard script shows the artist at the height of his powers, maintaining both regularity and dynamism throughout a text of more than 10,000 characters. The text is a partial transcription of The Lotus Sutra, a popular Buddhist scripture. The scroll was originally one of a set of seven that Zhao made for his friend Zhongfeng Mingben (1263C1323), a prominent Buddhist monk.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP324228_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78863

Poem Written in a Boat on the Wu River,Mi Fu,ca. 1095,"Sun Guoting's Manual on Calligraphy (687) states that calligraphy reveals the character and emotions of the writer. Few works demonstrate this principle as clearly as this handscroll by Mi Fu, the leading calligrapher of late Northern Song. Mi wrote Sailing on the Wu River with a suspended arm, working from the elbow rather than the wrist. It was not his aim to form perfect characters; instead, he entrusted his writing to the force of the brush, giving free reign to idiosyncratic movements, collapsing and distorting the characters for the sake of expressiveness. Su Shi (1036C1101) likened Mi's writing to ""a sailboat in a gust of wind, or a warhorse charging into battle."" Traditionally, calligraphy has been more highly esteemed in China than painting. In the 1950s when John Crawford began collecting it, most American scholars were unaware of its importance and the authenticity of many Crawford pieces was questioned. Today, these works are regarded as national treasures and the Metropolitan is the only leading museum in the West able to present major examples of this quintessential Chinese art form.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP118649_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39919
Reminiscing about the River,Wucius Wong (Wang Wuxie),1988,"Considered one of the most important painters in postwar Hong Kong, Wucius Wong was active in New York’s Chinese American artistic circle in the 1980s and 1990s.Reminiscing about a Riveris typical of Wong’s style of this period, when he made ink landscapes set within geometric structures. The painting depicts a sprawling mountainous landscape from an aerial view with winding rivers and streams creating depth and movement. Borrowing a concept from Wong’s early career as a graphic designer, the crisscrossing structure that divides each panel into quadrants draws the eye to the painting surface. For Wong, design elements such as this modernize ink painting’s perspectival orientations. Using brushwork and layers of ink wash in various densities, Wong achieves dramatic light contrasts and atmospheric effects that reflect a wide range of art historical influences from Rembrandt’s and Caravaggio’s treatment of light to J. M. W.

Illustration of Su Shi’s “Second Rhapsody on Red Cliff”,Zhang Ruitu,dated 1628,"Passing the palace examination with high honors in 1607, Zhang Ruitu held a number of important government posts before being elevated to the grand secretariat in 1626 through the support of the powerful eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568C1627). Zhang, a renowned calligrapher, won favor with Wei by writing out texts composed in the eunuch's honor. Although Zhang retired from office in 1628, shortly after Wei's downfall, he was later listed as one of the eunuch's followers andescaped imprisonment only by paying a large fine. He spent his last years in his native Fujian, and most of his paintings date to that period.Zhang Ruitu's illustration of Su Shi's (1036C1101) Second Ode on the Red Cliff focuses on the moment Su Shi, separated from his companions, climbs the cliff and comes face-to-face with untamed nature.

Silent fisherman in an autumn wood,Shen Zhou,dated 1475,"Born to a family of scholars and artists, Shen Zhou chose to lead a life of quiet retirement at home, pursuing the scholar-artist ideal of practicing painting and calligraphy as a form of self-cultivation. Although he did not turn to painting until he was nearly forty, he was later heralded as the father of the Wu school.Painted when Shen Zhou was forty-eight, Silent Angler in an Autumn Wood is a relatively early work. Nevertheless, it exhibits the kind of bold brushwork and composition that typify the artist's mature style. Eliminating any background so that the screen of foreground trees fills the picture plane, Shen Zhou maximized the impact of the surface patterns made by his blunt, powerful brushstrokes.According to Shen Zhou's inscription, the painting was done for two old friends, father and son, who had come for a visit. In both his painting and the accompanying poem, Shen used the image of the fisherman to symbolize the pleasures of scholarly retirement. To emphasize that such pleasures are a state of mind, Shen's angler, dressed in a scholar's robe and seated on a leopard skin, holds a pole that has neither hook nor line.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-13849-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45682
Landscape after a poem by Wang Wei,Tang Di,1323,"Tang Di was one of the first southern scholar-artists to revive the Northern Song landscape traditions of the tenth and eleventh centuries, and this composition is typical of the many large-scale works he produced in emulation of northern prototypes. While Northern Song masters were inclined to depict the dynamic forces of nature through richly descriptive pictorial techniques, Tang reinterpreted the style using more calligraphic conventions. Here, he uses the gnarled trees and desolate lowlands of eleventh-century masters to ""illustrate"" a couplet by Wang Wei (699C759):I walk to where the water endsAnd sit and watch as clouds arise.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP154120.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41194
Spring Clouds at the Pine Studio,Zhang Yu,dated 1366,"A poet, calligrapher, and painter known as one of the Ten Friends of the North Wall, Zhang Yu lived in the Suzhou area before the end of the Yuan dynasty. He accepted an appointment in 1371 to serve the Ming, but despite the loyal services he performed his earlier friendships made him suspect in the eyes of the Ming founder, Zhu Yuanzhang (r. 1368C98), and he was eventually driven to suicide. This landscape, painted two years before the founding of the Ming dynasty, shows the artist in the peaceful state of mind of the recluse. In late Yuan painting the depiction of a thatched studio by a stream became popular as a symbol of the scholar's condition―a life in reclusion. Zhang Yu's poetic sensibility is expressed through the subtle use of ink wash and pale colors and in the suggestion of dense moisture-laden clouds dissipating after a spring shower. The descriptive realism of the work relates the painter to the more conservative styles of the early Yuan period; the horizontal black and blue-green ""Mi"" dots may have been inspired by Spring Mountains and Pines (National Palace Museum, Taipei), attributed to Mi Fu (1052C1107).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36818-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41185
Ten Kings of Hell,Jin Chushi,before 1195,"This is one from a set of scrolls (30.76.290C.294) illustrating the theme of the Ten Kings of Hell, which developed during the second half of the Tang dynasty (618C907). The theme transforms the Indian Buddhist view of judgment after death into a typically Chinese bureaucratic process. Before being permitted to transmigrate into the next life, a soul is tried by a different king each week for seven weeks; it is sent to the eighth king on the hundredth day, to the ninth after a year, and to the tenth the third year after death. Here, each scroll shows a king―assisted by a scribe and other officials―examining and passing sentence on the souls of the dead; in the foreground demons punish the wicked.Most extant Song and Yuan dynasty Buddhist paintings were preserved in Japan; many had been taken there from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, an important port city for Japanese merchants and pilgrims. Inscriptions on the present paintings state that they were made in the studio of Jin Chushi, a Buddhist layman in Mingzhou, the name for Ningbo before it was changed to Qingyuanfu in 1195; the paintings, therefore, must date prior to that year. Stylistically, they are extremely close to The Five Hundred Luohans in the Zen Buddhist temple Daitokuji, Kyoto, which were also made in Ningbo and are dated 1178. The vivid drawing and the intense colors of these works are typical of the best Buddhist narrative paintings of the period.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP217414.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44510

Scholar and Pine,Zhang Daqian,dated 1947,"A native of Sichuan Province, Zhang Daqian learned to paint flowers as a child from his mother. At the age of nineteen he went to Kyoto to study textile weaving and dyeing. Returning to China in 1919, Zhang lived in Shanghai, Suzhou, and later, Beijing, where he immersed himself in the study of traditional painting. After the Japanese occupied Beijing in 1937, Zhang escaped to Sichuan, where he remained until 1948, except for a two year period between 1941 and 1943 when he studied and made copies of the early Buddhist wall paintings at the cave temples in Dunhuang, Gansu. In Sichuan, Zhang lived primarily at the famous Shangqing Daoist temple outside of Zhengdu, where he was inspired to paint landscape scenes and Daoist figures, untroubled by the war that had engulfed much of China.Pine trees are a symbol of longevity in China, and this painting was clearly created as a birthday gift for a friend or patron.

Vimalakirti and the Doctrine of Nonduality,Wang Zhenpeng,dated 1308,"This handscroll depicts an episode from the Vimalakirti Sutra, the Buddhist scripture in which Vimalakirti, a layman, and Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, engage in a theological debate. According to the sutra, Vimalakirti proved the more subtle by remaining silent when asked to explain the ultimate meaning of the Buddhist Law. The subject appealed to China's Confucian elite, for it demonstrated how a cultured layman could surpass even a deity in his understanding of doctrine.The scroll is a rare example of a preparatory draft, submitted for the approval of the future Emperor Renzong (r. 1311C20) before a final version in color was executed.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP258040_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40513

Recluse washing his feet in a stream,Chen Guan,dated 1629,"Near a thatched cottage, a recluse sits on the branch of a tree over a babbling creek and dips his feet in the cool water. A servant approaches on the path behind him with a jug of wine.

Landscapes and poems,Xiang Shengmo,1636,"Xiang Shengmo grew up surrounded by the art collection amassed by his grandfather, Xiang Yuanbian, one of the preeminent collectors of painting and calligraphy in Chinese history. He saw these treasures early and often, and by the time he began to paint, the styles of the old masters were ingrained in his hand and mind. His training was deepened by interaction with those who came to study the collection, including the peerless Dong Qichang (1555C1636). In this album, which features the artist’s poetry paired with his paintings, he does not identify specific old-master styles by name, but the diversity of manners reflects the encyclopedic knowledge afforded by his fortunate upbringing. There is no doubt that Xiang expected knowledgeable viewers of his day to recognize subtle references to famous styles and even specific paintings.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-13994-002_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/747457
Sketches of Twelve Strange Mountain Peaks,Huang Binhong,ca. 1935,"In this album, Huang Binhong uses a remarkably fresh linear style to depict a series of famous mountain sites in China. A consummate literatus, Huang Binhong had his first opportunity to travel extensively when he was in his sixties. He produced thousands of sketches in response to new sights and transformed his style, shedding the traditional vocabulary of brushstrokes, unlearning what he had cultivated for years, to develop through contour drawing a more direct means of depicting what he saw. This series of sketches utilizes the popular travel gazetteer format, typically published in woodblock print editions.These landscape compositions are ""picturesque"" in a sense defined by a long tradition of landscape art in China. Huang's means of defining form by delineating edges without texture patterning and recording with the hand what the eye traces, however, is a radical departure for Chinese painting. It proved an interim step for Huang Binhong on his road to a late landscape style in which the qualities of ink were again exploited and ink resumed its traditional place alongside brushline as the paired tools of description and expression.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT8401.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36264
Dark (Heaven) and Yellow (Earth),Wang Dongling,2005,"By the late 1990s Wang began to untether his compositions from any text, creating a series of monumental abstractions that may be appreciated as gestural art. His powerful brushwork, executed with a mop-size brush (thus engaging his entire body), calls to mind Action Painting. But Wang’s emphasis on balancing spontaneous, energized strokes with the surrounding white space is equally informed by years of calligraphic practice, particularly of cursive script. The title echoes the work’s grand scale in its reference to the colors of the sky and the earth at the beginning of creation, as described in the ancient Book of Changes (Yi Jing).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP294314.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77571
Traveling through Snow-Covered Mountains,Yao Yanqing (Tingmei),未知年代,"Yao Yanqing, a native of Wuxing in Zhejiang Province, followed in the footsteps of his fellow townsmen Zhao Mengfu (1254C1322) and Tang Di (1287C1355) in adopting the landscape idiom of Li Cheng (919C967) and Guo Xi (ca. 1000Cca. 1090). During the Northern Song (960C1127), the Li-Guo style had enjoyed state sponsorship, with court artists creating idealized visions of majestic pines and mountains presiding over hierarchically ordered landscapes; these could be interpreted as images of enlightened rule engendering a prosperous and stable domain. Understandably, this style was preferred for Yuan court commissions and for works produced for northern patrons serving as officials in the south.This painting no longer bears an artist’s signature or seals, but its stylistic idiosyncracies identify it unmistakably as the work of Yao Yanqing. Mountain forms are delineated through a schematic alternation of densely textured fissures and stark white areas that resemble pathways. Prominent black dots intended to indicate cavities sit on the painting’s surface. In evoking the earlier master’s style, Yao reduced Guo Xi’s highly descriptive and richly varied texture strokes and contour lines to a limited repertoire of calligraphic mannerisms.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP235585.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39549

Quatrain on yellow roses,Empress Yang Meizi,early 13th century,"During the reign of Ningzong (1202C24), his consort, the empress Yang Meizi, was a formidable presence, both in politics and in the arts. Starting out as a young musician in the palace of Empress Wu (wife of Gaozong), Yang Meizi found favor with Ningzong and in 1202 maneuvered her way into becoming his wife. Wielding great power in court politics, she had the powerful prime minister Han Tuozhou executed in 1207 without consulting her husband. In 1224, when Ningzong died, she dethroned Crown Prince Hong and supported Prince Yun, who became Emperor Lizong (r. 1224C64).An excellent calligrapher who practiced the imperial style initiated by Gaozong (r. 1127C62), the empress may have inscribed this poem on the opposite side of a fan painting of roses by a court artist:Snowy stamens dot the tender yellow [flowers];The rose is drenched with the morning dew thatwets my garment.As the west wind sweeps away the wild bees andbutterflies,I alone, at the border of Heaven, keep companywith the fragrant cassia tree.(Wen C.

Gao's contemporary vision uses the iconoclastic ink play of the early Qing monk painters Badashanren (Zhu Da, 1626C1705) and Shitao (Dao Zhi, 1642C1707). Gao confounds rational space in a strong interplay of surface and depth, solid and void. There is humor in the bird's awkward balance as it tends to its parasites.

Poem,Ni Yuanlu,undated,"明 倪元璐 行五言 S 本This calligraphy is an outstanding example of Ni Yuanlu’s idiosyncratic mature style. In many places, Ni let his brush dry out before reloading it with ink, which created sharp contrasts between wet and dry, light and dark. Ni moved the brush in choppy, staccato motions to produce surprising―even awkward―angular twists and turns. The overall effect is both powerful and quirky, a deliberate affront to smooth elegance.The poem reads:The reflection of the bridge looks like a long piece of silk;The fat toad taunts the skinny colt.After ten mountains, there appears a stream;Buddhists to the east, butchers to the west.Stalks of bamboo invite clouds to be their guests;Flowers entrap butterflies, making them their captives.Lovely is the scent of wine wafting from the shop!Fortunately I still have three coins on me.―Trans. by Shi-yee LiuNi, who served the Ming dynasty (1368C1644) court in its waning years, lived during one of the most troubled periods in Chinese history. Some scholars see the turbulence of his calligraphic style as a mirror of his times―an artistic response to tragedy.

He is best known for a distinctive ""square-brush"" style of calligraphy derived from the engraved stone writings of the Northern Wei dynasty (386C534), as seen in his dedication and signature here, but he also developed a distinctively plump seal-script manner exemplified by this couplet, which expresses a sentiment appropriate for a Confucian household:Great virtue comes from forbearance,sincerity comes from a mind free from deception.(translated by Jason Zhixin Sun)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT4688.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/55495
Traveling Amid Streams and Mountains,Liu Yu,1680,"Working in the cosmopolitan city of Nanjing, Liu Yu was exposed to a wide range of artistic influences. His volumetric mountain masses arrayed in sweeping patterns reflect the influence of Dong Qichang (1555C1636). The pale, dry brushwork set off by jet black foliage dots suggests familiarity with the Anhui School painters, while the fantastic landscape formations and bold juxtapositions of deep distance views with startling close-ups show his indebtedness to earlier Nanjing painters such as Wu Bin (act. ca. 1583C1626).

In his inscription, Jin speaks of the good fortune of the plum painters Yang Buzhi (1097C1169) and Ding Yetang (active mid-13th century), whose works gained imperial recognition.

Vegetables,Guo Dawei,ca. 1965,"Guo Dawei painted this delightful scroll of various vegetables in a spontaneous, abbreviated manner. The coarse lines, especially those defining the mustard greens at the far left, exhibit the raw, artless quality that he also valued in calligraphy. His inclusion of the mustard greens' yellow flowers―an indication of overripeness and, therefore, rarely seen in this genre―enabled him to make the rhythmic alternation of color in the scroll end on a high note, further enhancing the sense of exuberance and joy.Guo Dawei considered compositional mastery crucial to a work of art and the hardest quality to attain. In this painting, the alternation between slight scattered vegetables and compact monumental ones creates a lively compositional syncopation that reaches a crescendo with the extravagantly extroverted form of the mustard greens.Guo Dawei may have become acquainted with Lin Yutang when he was studying at Columbia University in the late 1950s.

Here, Xie also transcribed several connoisseurs' comments and colophons on Zhang's calligraphic work, as well as the master's biography from the Xuanhe shupu (ca. 1120), a catalogue of the emperor Huizong's calligraphy collection.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/sf2005_411_1_d1_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72833
Paper Med No.18,Su Xianzhong,2020,"This sculpture demonstrates Su Xianzhong’s innovative way of linking his work to traditional forms. The artist is from a respected potter’s family in Dehua, a historical center of white porcelain production in China. His great grandfather Su Xuejin (1869C1919) established a famous workshop producing white porcelain sculptures of legendary and religious figures in the early twentieth century. The Met acquired a sculpture of an immortal with deer by Su Xuejin in 1934 (34.13). The undulating porcelain sheets on the current piece recall the curving draperies on his great grandfather’s traditional porcelain figures. But the contemporary artist successfully used a new technique―combining fabric and porcelain slip―to create a lively trompe l’oeil effect. Porcelain appears to be transformed into paper. Like his ancestor’s figures, this piece is imbued with life energy and a sense of movement.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-30175-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/894291

Landscape in the Style of Liang Kai,Xie Zhiliu,Dated 1980,"In the 1950s, Xie took an interest in the atmospheric landscape paintings of the Southern Song dynasty (1127C1279). This scroll, painted in imitation of Liang Kai's (ca. 1150?Cca. 1220?) abbreviated style of ink wash, illustrates Xie's ability to create pictorial poetry through the spontaneous application of contrasting washes. The flying geese and the bamboo silhouetted against drifting mist are characteristic Southern Song motifs.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP224433.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72953
Scholar admiring plum blossoms,Unidentified artist,13th century,"This small landscape is a rare example of the continuation of the Southern Song Painting Academy manner during the Mongol occupation. With the establishment of the native Chinese Ming dynasty in 1368, the Song style again returned to prominence as the model for the Ming Imperial Painting Academy. This painting demonstrates that practitioners of the Song style continued to work through the fourteenth century, bridging the gap between the two formal academies.Executed in the mode of the Song master Ma Yuan (act. ca. 1190C1225), the painting continues the subject matter and vividly descriptive manner of the Song but uses more abstract outline strokes to define rocks and tree trunks, reflecting the development of a calligraphic brush style by Yuan scholar-artists.Almost no paintings of this type survive in China; all known examples come from Japan, where this style and tall narrow format had an important influence on Japanese artists of the Muromachi period (1333C1573).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36423-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40433

Spring Morning in the Mountains,Xie Shichen,未知年代,"The paintings of Xie Shichen share features with both those of the Zhe-school professionals and those of the Suzhou scholar-artists. His ""hemp-fiber"" texture strokes and dark foliage dots derive from the work of the eminent Suzhou amateur Shen Zhou (1427C1509), but his monumental compositions, narrative subject matter, and bold brushwork owe more to the Nanjing professional Wu Wei (1459C1508).In this painting, a pair of scholars on a spring outing have paused to admire a blossoming plum tree that grows beneath the sheltering branches of an ancient pine. The nearby mountain torrent flows out of a deep valley, where dense white clouds obscure the lower halves of precipitous peaks, including the towering central monolith whose position along the painting's vertical axis serves as an anchor to the entire composition. To the left of the peak, Xie inscribed a seven-character quatrain along with his signature.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/1991_342_O.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45810

Windblown bamboo,Xia Chang,ca. 1460,"Bamboo, which bends without breaking, has long been a symbol of integrity and strength. It was also a favorite subject of Ming and Qing scholar-painters. Xia Chang, a native of the Suzhou region, enjoyed a successful official career that led to his appointment as minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices in 1457. He expanded Wang Fu's (1362C1416) style of bamboo painting to become the leading bamboo painter of his time, famous even in Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia.Applying calligraphic techniques to painting according to the precepts established by Zhao Mengfu (1254C1322), Xia Chang executed his bamboo stalks in the archaic seal-script style and his bamboo twigs in the ""grass,"" or cursive-script, style. Xia Chang's calligraphic mode of bamboo painting was followed by many later Ming and Qing painters.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP154126.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44590
Scholar-recluse in blue-green landscape,Chen Hongshou,1633,"Between the ages of ten and twenty, Chen Hongshou studied painting in Hangzhou with the professional artist Lan Ying (1585C1664), with whom he must have trained by copying Song and Song-style pictures in the local Zhejiang tradition. In his mature years, however, Chen played on the mannerisms and formal distortions of contemporary Song imitations, turning the debased features of this worn-out tradition into elements of a new archaism infused with a highly personal sense of ironic melancholy.In this monumental landscape Chen alludes to the antique blue-and-green style in his use of flat planes of color, patterned foliage, and boldly contoured trees and rocks. Yet the exaggerated landscape forms and stylized banks of mist accentuate the unreality of the archaic conventions, emphasizing the isolation of the sensitively drawn gentleman and his attendant, whose presence gives the scene a troubling psychological edge.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT371470.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39558

Poem by Huang Tingjian,Shen Yinmo,undated,"Shen Yinmo was one of the most influential calligraphers of twentieth-century China. Here, he has transcribed a poem by the eminent scholar-official, poet, and calligrapher Huang Tingjian (1045C1105), upon assuming an official post in Ye County (in Henan Province). The poem, inspired] by two well-known local legends, is a meditation on the vicissitudes of human history:The white crane left in search of Wang Zijin [fl. sixth century B.C.];The true dragon yearned for Shen Zhuliang [fl. late sixth century B.C.].Events in the remote past are gone like birds flying away;Now I pour out my sorrow, facing the setting sun.Old folks from former times can still name the counties of the Tang dynasty;On broken steles remain the writings of the Jin period.The drifting clouds make no plan to settle down;Only the desolate mountains linger in lasting thoughts.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)Shen Yinmo was particularly influenced by the calligraphy of the early Tang master Chu Suiliang (596C658). This work reflects Chu's elegant finesse in the tall, slightly tilted configuration of the characters and in the sensuous fluctuation of the brushstrokes within graceful structures. The pronounced waviness of Shen's long, horizontal strokes is a salient feature of Huang Tingjian's calligraphy that Shen quite naturally incorporated in transcribing Huang's poem.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-29532-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72786

Fragment of a Manuscript,Wang Zhideng,未知年代,"Like many talented men, Wang Zhideng failed to gain an official appointment but, after the death of Wen Zhengming (1470C1559), he became the most renowned poet of his time and presided over Suzhou literary circles for the last thirty years of his life.A respected calligrapher, this piece preserves the opening section of Wang's essay ""Cave among Mountains and Waters,"" which describes the scripture study room of the Yunyin Monastery near Suzhou. Wang most likely composed this work at the request of the monastery's abbot or patrons, a common practice for literary and artistic luminaries. His refined and relaxed calligraphy, modeled after Wen Zhengming's running-standard script style, suitably complements the lighthearted tone of his prose.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153905.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/48926

Chrysanthemums by a rock,Gao Fenghan,18th century,"At the age of fifty-four Gao Fenghan lost the use of his right hand. Painfully retraining himself to write and paint with his left hand, he came to prize the naive awkwardness of his left-handed brushwork. He lived in a Buddhist monastery in Yangzhou for four years, became close friends with several of the so-called Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, then retired to his hometown in Shandong Province in 1741. Chrysanthemums by a Rock is a dashing performance of Gao's mature years. Although done in his highly expressive left-handed style, his vigorous wet brushwork is a direct outgrowth of the lush exuberant flower paintings of Shitao (1642C1707), who lived in Yangzhou for the last twelve years of his life. Gao's calligraphy is dynamically integrated with his painting. Filling in the leftover space, the robust rhythms of the writing seem a natural companion to the flowers and rock.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36016-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49238

Inkstone “Moon and Cloud”,Zhu Dai,2009,"Inkstones are one of the “four treasures of the scholar’s studio” along with ink, brush, and paper. The subtle dark color and fine texture of this piece identify it as a top quality stone from She prefecture (Anhui Province), one of the four most famous sources for inkstones in China. Renowned since the Song dynasty (960C1279), this fine-grained form of slate is ideal for grinding cakes of ink with water. To preserve as much of this precious stone as possible, the artist has left the slab largely intact, carving out only a small moon-shaped well for the liquid ink. The artist also took advantage of the natural banding in the stone to suggest a line of clouds crossing the “moon.” The work combines the traditional literati aesthetic for unadorned simplicity with a modern embrace of minimalism.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-24063-004.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/838930
Solitary traveler in the mountains,Fu Baoshi,ca. 1945,"Themes and images of reclusion have continued to be powerful tools for modern and contemporary artists, especially in times of trouble.

At bottom right, a solitary figure with a staff strides boldly into the mountains, leaving behind the cares of the world for the quietude and protection of nature.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-17989-117.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/772743
Rocky Landscape with Pines,Zhang Xun,before 1346,"A native of Suzhou, Zhang Xun maintained a peripatetic existence, supporting himself through tutoring and painting. Contemporaries note that he was widely learned, good at literary compositions, and an excellent calligrapher; in painting, he followed tenth-century prototypes, painting bamboo in the outline drawing method and landscapes in the manner of Juran (active ca. 960C95).Adhering strictly to tenth-century models, this landscape in the Juran mode is uncompromisingly austere and abstract. Written when Zhang was about fifty, the poem echoes the melancholy of the uninhabited landscape:On the rocky [landscape] pine blossoms fall and bloom again.The mountain Ailanthus, useless [for its timber], has grownto full size.No cart has ever reached this woodcutter's path.Now with hair gray, I have passed fifty years in vain.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP249730.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39548
Poem by Wang Wei,Dong Qichang,after 1632,"Immensely influential as a painter and art theorist, Dong Qichang is also renowned for his calligraphy, and, together with Xing Tong (1551C1612), Mi Wanzhong (act. ca. 1595Cafter 1631), and Zhang Ruitu (1570C1614), he is considered one of the Four Masters of the late Ming.As he did in his painting, Dong drew inspiration for his calligraphy from the ancient masters. Aimed at capturing the spirit rather than the physical likeness of his models, his writing style remained distinctively his own. In contrast to the brusque coarse power displayed by the calligraphy of other late Ming artists, Dong's fluid lines, alternately wet and dry from his constant twisting of the brush tip, possess tremendous grace. Dong wrote out a poem by Wang Wei (700C761):Among the mountains we bid each other farewell;The sun is setting as I close my bramble gate.Spring grass every year is green;But will the young prince ever return?",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-35893-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/48954
Zhou Dunyi Admiring Lotuses,Lu Peng,dated 1896,"Resting comfortably on a garden rock, a gentleman gazes lovingly at a pond of blossoming lotus. This is Zhou Dunyi (1017C1073), a prominent scholar of the Northern Song dynasty who so admired the lotus that he authored a treatise entitled “On the Love of the Lotus” to celebrate his favorite flower.

Gathering at the Orchid Pavilion,Qian Gu,1560,"In 353, the renowned calligrapher Wang Xizhi (307C365) and his friends met at the Orchid Pavilion (at Shanyin, in modern Zhejiang Province) to celebrate the spring festival of purification. Sitting by a stream, they held a poetry competition. When the time was up, eleven men had finished two poems, and fifteen had finished one; the sixteen who failed to come up with anything (among them, Wang’s son Xianzhi) were penalized by having to drink three additional cups of wine. In Qian Gu’s representation of this famous literary event, cups of wine float downstream as the poets, lined up on both sides, drink freely and struggle to complete their poems.Orphaned at an early age, Qian Gu did not receive a formal education until adulthood, when he became a pupil of Wen Zhengming (1470C1559). This painting is modeled after a composition said to have been originated by Li Gonglin (ca. 1049C1106).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP204430_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/48901

Drenched in Moonlight,Tong Yu,18th century,"Since the Song poet Lin Bu (967C1028) first celebrated the blossoming plums of his native Hangzhou (in Zhejiang province), plums have been a special subject for artists from that region. Tong Yu, from nearby Shaoxing, followed the local tradition established by his townsman Wang Mian (1287C1359).The thrusting limbs of a blossoming plum energize this composition. Typically, neither tree trunk nor ground plane is depicted; instead the artist focuses on the dynamic counterpoint of two sturdy branches that curve in opposite directions. The moon and the flowers stand out in uninked plain paper, left in reserve against the lightly tinted night sky.Tong Yu was also an accomplished calligrapher. His inscription on this painting, which combines clerical and cursive scripts―his two specialties―plays on the aesthetic of juxtaposing contrasting script types:Drenched in MoonlightThe ocean of clouds disperses; after the snowfall it beginsto clear.The myriad valleys, in silent chill, remain frozen and muted.Only the plum trees in the moonlight on Mount Gu [inWest Lake, Hangzhou]Branch out at will, unconcerned with the passage of time.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP146993.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73161

Drinking and Composing Poetry,Yao Shou,dated 1485,"Yao Shou left government service in 1468 and retired to Jiaxing, hometown of the Yuan artist Wu Zhen (1280C1354), to devote himself to self-cultivation and the arts. Taking Wu Zhen's paintings as his model, Yao Shou had an important influence on Suzhou (Wu school) artists through his friendship with the Suzhou amateur Shen Zhou (1427C1509).Yao's round brush lines, vigorous dotting, and subtle ink washes in Drinking to the Accompaniment of Letters derive from Wu Zhen; the same vocabulary of brushstrokes forms the basis of Shen Zhou's painting style. In subject matter, too, Yao's focus on his garden retreat―represented by the Yuan convention of a thatched hut―presages Wu school artists' fondness for depicting the gardens and specific topographic sites where they gathered to create or appreciate poetry and paintings.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP205754_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45675
Drunk in Autumn Woods,Shitao (Zhu Ruoji),ca. 1702,"Exploring the theme of intoxication, Shitao makes us reel with the unsteadiness of his figures and landscape. He probably created this picture to commemorate an autumn outing in the hills with friends. The three inscriptions testify to the pleasure and pride that Shitao took in his achievement; they make it clear that the exhilaration experienced by the friends was inspired by nature, poetry, conviviality, and creativity as well as wine.In an instant, mists and clouds can return to theirprimeval form;Red trees fill the skies, spreading fire throughthe heavens.I invite you, sir, to get very drunk on my blackbrushstrokes;Lie down and watch the frosted forest as fallingleaves swirl.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-13954-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49178
Mantises Fighting on Bamboo,Wang Xuetao,20th century,"In his youth, Wang Xuetao studied with two masters, Qi Baishi (1864C1957) and Wang Yun (1887C1934). While he maintained a long friendship with Qi, Wang Yun's emphasis on gathering visual memories had a more profound impact on his art. In this painting, the lively poses of the mantises, the complexity of their forms, and the vivid suggestion of movement, which could not have been capturedthrough sketching alone, reflect the artist's recreation from memory of a dramatic confrontation that he observed in his garden.The mantis is the only common species of insect that can stand upright on its two hind legs, bend its waist forward and backward, and turn its head 180 degrees. Such anthropomorphic traits are essential to Wang's representation of insects. This scene, for example, readily brings to mind a fistfight. Confounding realism, however, Wang endows these green mantises with red eyes. His subjective use of color spices the otherwise cool palette of the picture and creates a visual resonance between the central image and the seals on either side.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP146984.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72801
Plum Blossoms,Qi Baishi,dated 1950,"This painting of a mauve blossoming plum is unusual in Qi Baishi's oeuvre because Qi loved the cheerfulness of bright red and usually painted plum blossoms in that color. The pendant branches intersect with one another, forming an abstract network of calligraphic lines that is barely organic. Qi Baishi's later plum paintings are primarily inspired by Wu Changshuo (1844C1927), who introduced an epigraphic aesthetic to the art of painting. In this work, the absence of spatial depth, the even width and smooth turns of the twigs, and the pronounced parallelism of the interlaced branches attest to Qi's indebtedness to Wu as well as his solid discipline in seal-carving and epigraphy. Qi's paintings are first of all reflections of things and feelings that he had personally experienced in life. In the case of plum blossoms, his fondness of this subject resulted from nostalgia for his hometown in Hunan, where his dwelling, named ""Studio of Hundred Plums,"" was surrounded by a plum grove.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-25906-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72781
Poem Written in Seal Script,Feng Kanghou,dated 1975,"Feng Kanghou settled in Hong Kong after the Communist takeover of mainland China in 1949 and became its foremost seal-carver. He maintained that only those who practiced seal-script calligraphy could master the art of seal carving. This transcription of a poetic quatrain demonstrates his mastery. It reads:Feeling elated at the return of the yang energy on the winter solstice,In the company of the solitary flowers, I enjoy wine.I hope the rain will be timely on the cultivated fields,So next year we will have an abundant harvest and no drought.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)Emulating the balanced, symmetrical forms incised with a stylus on ancient bronzes and stones, characters are composed of lines of uniform width and rounded ends. In Feng's tall, rectilinear characters, vertical and horizontal lines are often subtly bowed and their intersections form curves rather than sharp angles. As in seal carvings, the negative spaces between the inked lines are meticulouslyproportioned. To create characters of such monumentality and elegance with a supple-tipped brush requires great mental concentration, a steady hand, and years of rigorous discipline.Feng wrote this piece at the request of Richard Lai in the winter of 1975. The poem conveys the wistful state of mind of an agricultural society at the time of the winter solstice.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP146983.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72800
Poems on painting plum blossoms and bamboo,Zhao Mengjian,dated 1260,"An accomplished poet, collector, painter, and calligrapher and a member of the Song royal family, Zhao Mengjian was compared by his contemporaries to the famous scholar-connoisseur Mi Fu (1052C1107). Like Mi's, Zhao's writing does not derive from a single source but combines the best of many earlier models: the natural charm of the fourth-century Jin writers, the brush method and character structure of the seventh-century Tang masters, and the free expression of the eleventh-century Northern Song calligraphers.This scroll, which transcribes Zhao's poems on plum and bamboo painting, is his best-known extant calligraphic work. Written for a young relative who was studying painting, the poems stress acute observation of nature and mastery of brush methods and conventions, as well as the importance of personal expression.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP146538_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40285
The Sixteen Luohans,Shitao (Zhu Ruoji),dated 1667,"Shitao, born Zhu Ruoji, a scion of the Ming imperial family, escaped death in his youth by taking refuge in the Buddhist priesthood. In 1662 he became a disciple of the powerful Chan (Zen) master Lü’an Benyue (d. 1676). In the late 1660s and 1670s, while living in seclusion in temples around Xuancheng, Anhui Province, he taught himself to paint.In The Sixteen Luohans, Shitao’s earliest major extant work, the young painter, then twenty-five, drew what are possibly the most effective figures since the Yuan period (1279C1368). A rare religious subject for Shitao, known for his visionary landscapes, the scroll depicts the sixteen guardian luohans (saints) ordered by the Buddha to live in the mountains and protect the Buddhist law until the coming of the future Buddha.Stylistically, the immediate sources for Shitao’s figures were late Ming painters, such as Ding Yunpeng (1547Cca. 1621) and Wu Bin (act. ca. 1583C1626). Unlike Wu Bin’s luohans, which seem to be merely grotesque caricatures, Shitao’s are carefully observed, showing such thoroughly human qualities as humor and curiosity.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153677.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49170
Crabapple Blossoms,Zhang Daqian,dated 1965,"Zhang Daqian painted this pendant bough of blossoms in New York in the fall of 1965 and dedicated it to Lin Yutang's son-in-law, Li Ming (Richard Lai). The clusters of tiny pink flowers on delicate filaments and ovoid leaves identify the tree as a chuisi haitang (literally ""crabapple with drooping filaments""), or a Hall crabapple, a species indigenous to China. It was a favorite of Zhang Daqian's.In rendering the branches and leaves, Zhang Daqian adapted a technique initiated by the seventeenth-century master, Shitao (1642C1707). He first drew the bough in dark ink. After it was completely dry, he applied a second layer of lighter ink to its upper part to make itvolumetric. Finally, he added daubs of blue-green to suggest leaf buds or lichen. Leaves were rendered in the same manner. There is no bleeding between dark and light ink or between ink and color. The result is a vibrant, shimmering effect that makes the bough appear to quiver in the wind.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-29417-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72794
Scholar's Tools,Qi Baishi,dated 1947,"This painting of artists' tools―inkstone, water pot and brushes with ink trailing from the brush tip―conveys the fresh vision of Qi Baishi brought to painting by sweeping away pedantry, stale imitation and tired imagery. Sophisticated, sure and sincere, his paginating wittily conjures what is not depicted―painter and work―and the deliberate simplicity of his brushwork in the tools is complemented by the meticulous polish of the insect that feels its way across the imagined painter's table.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-25515-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49658

The Immortal Li Tieguai,Su Renshan,未知年代,"A true eccentric, Su Renshan was virtually unknown during his lifetime but was discovered in the twentieth century. Born just south of Canton, Su was given a classical education but failed the provincial civil-service examination. He gave up the pursuit of an official career and, at age twenty-two, devoted himself to painting. In 1842 a family dispute caused Su to leave home for five years. When he returned in 1848, he was denounced as unfilial by his father and imprisoned in the local jail, where he died in 1850.Su's seemingly innocuous Immortal Li Tieguai, painted in the late 1840s, conveys the artist's growing frustration at having his talents go unrecognized. Li Tieguai (Li of the Iron Crutch) was one of the legendary Eight Immortals of the Daoist pantheon. Once, when Li was transmigrating outside his body, his seemingly lifeless form was discovered and cremated. When Li returned and found his body gone, he was forced to inhabit the body of a crippled beggar. In Su's humorous depiction, the immortal is shown sleeping, clutching his knees, his iron staff beside him, the brim of his straw hat framing his body like a halo. A gourd, symbol of immortality because of a paradise magically concealed within, lies on the ground. Both the gourd and the immortal are presented frontally, their foreshortened forms appearing as a series of concentric contours.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-30134-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49433

Ten Kings of Hell,Jin Chushi,before 1195,"This is one from a set of scrolls (30.76.290C.294) illustrating the theme of the Ten Kings of Hell, which developed during the second half of the Tang dynasty (618C907). The theme transforms the Indian Buddhist view of judgment after death into a typically Chinese bureaucratic process. Before being permitted to transmigrate into the next life, a soul is tried by a different king each week for seven weeks; it is sent to the eighth king on the hundredth day, to the ninth after a year, and to the tenth the third year after death. Here, each scroll shows a king-assisted by a scribe and other officials-examining and passing sentence on the souls of the dead; in the foreground demons punish the wicked.Most extant Song and Yuan dynasty Buddhist paintings were preserved in Japan; many had been taken there from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, an important port city for Japanese merchants and pilgrims. Inscriptions on the present paintings state that they were made in the studio of Jin Chushi, a Buddhist layman in Mingzhou, the name for Ningbo before it was changed to Qingyuanfu in 1195; the paintings, therefore, must date prior to that year. Stylistically, they are extremely close to The Five Hundred Luohans in the Zen Buddhist temple Daitokuji, Kyoto, which were also made in Ningbo and are dated 1178.

Wangchuan Villa,Wang Yuanqi,dated 1711,"The elegant Wangchuan Villa situated in the picturesque hills on the outskirts of the Tang dynasty (618C907) capital, Chang'an (modern Xi'an), is one of the most famous gardens of ancient China. The rambling estate with spectacular scenery was the retreat of the poet, musician, and landscape painter Wang Wei (699C759). Almost one thousand years later, Wang Yuanqi used a rubbing of a Wangchuan composition etched into stone in 1617 for the general outlines of his painting and referred to Wang Wei's poems to guide his inspiration. In a colophon appended to the painting, Wang Yuanqi expresses satisfaction that he has captured some of Wang Wei's idea of ""painting in poetry and poetry in painting.""Tutored in painting by his grandfather Wang Shimin (1592C1680), Wang Yuanqi followed the lead of Dong Qichang (1555C1636), the first artist to transform landscape structure in painting by means of abstract compositional movements known as ""breath force"" (qishi). Inspired by the archaic convention of ringed mountain motifs in the engraving, Wang Yuanqi created ""dragon veins"" (longmo), through which the cosmic ""breath force"" vigorously flows.

The vivid drawing and the intense colors of these works are typical of the best Buddhist narrative paintings of the period.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP213863.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44507
Lotus,Shi Lu,undated,"Shi Lu used heavily saturated pools of diluted ink and color to evoke the languor of a summer afternoon by the banks of a lotus pond.

Planting Chrysanthemums,Lu Zhi,16th century,"Lu Zhi presented Planting Chrysanthemums to his friend Tao in exchange for rare cuttings. To express his ideal of reclusion, Lu combined poetry with painting:I hear you have opened up a “Tao path” near the ocean,Where clouds of leaves and frost-covered flowers vie inwondrous splendor.I too have built a new residence at Zhixing Mountain,May I share some of your autumn colors on myeastern hedge?The first two lines of Lu’s verse allude to “Peach Blossom Spring,” a famous poem by his friend’s namesake Tao Qian (365C427) in which a fisherman stumbles upon a hidden Utopia. In the last two lines, Lu suggests that he has planned his own Utopian retreat and refers to the growing of chrysanthemums, a passion he shared with Tao Qian.Lu was the son of a Suzhou schoolteacher and a pupil of Wen Zhengming (1470C1559). After his father’s death, Lu supported his family by selling his paintings. About 1557 he retired to the mountains west of Suzhou, where he led a reclusive life cultivating rare flowers, poetry, and painting. Awash in mist and soft colors, the crystalline mountains in Lu’s painting perfectly evoke the dreamlike Peach Blossom Land of the immortals.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT5558.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45815

Three Poems by Lu You and Du Fu in Cursive Script,Yu Youren,datable to 1959,"This handscroll consists of a pair of calligraphies. The one on the right, a transcription of a poem by Lu You (1125C1210), is dedicated to Li Ming (Richard Lai). The one on the left, written for Lin Taiyi, transcribes two poems by Du Fu (712C770): the seventh poem from ""Eight Poems on Autumn Moods"" and ""Thinking of Li Bai on a Spring Day."" Yu Youren was a distinguished calligrapher. Besides cultivating a powerful personal style, he spent decades attempting to standardize the cursive script, which had become increasingly eccentric and difficult to read or learn. Maintaining that the future of a modern nation relies on whether its writing system is easy to use, he and his colleagues in 1936 published the standard cursive forms of the thousand most frequently used characters. They urged practitioners to shun ligatures between adjacent characters and to avoid using varied forms for the same character. The first of three poems reads:I remember visiting the ponds and pavilions at Xiuchuan [in Yiwu, Zhejiang province].How melancholy I felt standing by the balustrade in the setting sun!This old man has traveled ten thousand miles;The light mist, as before, sends off his lone boat.Yearning for home, I have missed perch stew for too long;Spring colors have just returned to the isles of fragrant herbs.I'll buy a straw cape to fish in the rain;To whom should I decline in advance [to catch] the seagulls?Lu Fangweng [Lu You, 1125C1210], ""On the Xiuchuan Station""(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP146943_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72784

Whiling Away the Summer at the Ink-Well Thatched Hut,Wu Li,1679,"In his inscription, Wu Li records that he painted this handscroll one clear morning after a rainfall, sitting alone in his studio thinking of an absent friend. There is a dreamlike quality about the painting: birds, trees, bamboo, mist, and even rocks dance joyously around the hermit-scholar, who sits quietly reading in his idyllic domain. Although he was an ardent admirer of Huang Gongwang (1269C1354), Wu transformed the Yuan painter's ""hemp-fiber"" texture strokes into a distinctly personal style: cool pale ink textures in intricate contrasting patterns, silhouetted and suspended in space, have been applied with both an athlete's vigor and a poet's gentle cadence.In 1681, two years after he painted this work, Wu Li was baptized as a Christian, a most uncommon thing to do for a man of his background. Ordained in Macao as a priest in 1688, he was sent in 1689 to do missionary work in Shanghai, where he died in 1718.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153654_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49158
Mr. Hong Please Come In,Hong Hao,1998,"Hong Hao gazes from a scene of exquisitely composed cultural accumulation. On the table in front of him, three architectural models (approximations of Gothic, South Asian, and Egyptian temples) equate this conspicuous display to a kind of religiosity, a sentiment echoed by the otherwise cryptic phrase at the photograph’s upper edge: ""A gentle tone readily allows Mr. Hong to enter a peaceful reverie."" But the scene is an elaborate ruse: Hong has digitally inserted himself into a self-promotional advertisement (the work of American commercial photographer Christopher Irion) in order to lampoon the perceived excesses of an economically integrated China. The repetition of Hong’s name in the overprinted title accentuates self-centeredness, signaling that capitalist consumption is the new norm.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ph/mobile-large/DP-22421-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/291673
Portrait of the imperial guard Zhanyinbao,Unidentified artist,dated 1760,"Under the Manchu emperors of the Qing dynasty, portraiture again became an important court-sponsored art. This full-length depiction of an imperial bodyguard of the first rank is from a set of one hundred portraits of loyal officials and valiant warriors commissioned by the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736C95) that originally hung in the Hall of Imperial Brilliance (Ziguang Ge), the pavilion in the Forbidden City where the emperor received tribute offerings and entertained foreign emissaries.The poem inscribed in both Chinese and Manchu above the painting lauds Zhanyinbao's valor in combating nomadic rebels in the desert wastes of Central Asia:Barehanded he rode the giant whale,Capturing Weinuo in battle.The bandits' heads were strung togetherThe length of his long lance.With both hands he held open the declaration of warAll the way to Balikun [in Sinjiang Province].Without [even pausing] to comb his horse's mane,He returned and reported to his commander.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT8324.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49249
30 Letters to Qiu Jiawa,Qiu Zhijie,2009,"Part of a project entitled “A Suicidology of the Nanjing Yangzi River Bridge” initiated in 2007, this triptych presents one span of the Nanjing Yangzi River Bridge embellished with symbolic elements that present a complex meditation on time and the human condition. The bridge, which opened in 1968 as the first modern highway and railway bridge to span the Yangzi River, was designed and built entirely by the Chinese and heralded as a symbol of New China. But it is also the site of the highest number of suicides in China. Qiu’s project led him to research the bridge’s construction, to work with suicide-prevention volunteers, and to interview survivors and the families of those who have committed suicide. Each painting also includes a terse statement to his newborn daughter, from left to right: “The future they describe is only towers in the sky”; “Don’t try leaving the present”; and “You constantly need to go back to the past.”",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/Fig  70 Qiu Zhijie_30 Letters to Qiu Jiawa.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78022
Calligraphy,Ni Yuanlu,未知年代,"An ardent reformer and opponent of the eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568C1627), Ni Yuanlu rose to the position of minister of revenue and lecturer to the emperor. When the rebel Li Zicheng (1605?C1645) took the capital on April 25, 1644, Ni, like the Ming emperor, committed suicide rather than fall into enemy hands.Ni, who was admired for his patriotism, had an angular calligraphic and painting style that was said to reflect his character. Ni's early calligraphy was done with sharp ""side-tip"" strokes made with the brush held obliquely, while in his later works, as in this piece, the writing is rounder and mellower. This poem is one of five that Ni Yuanlu composed for the waterways administrator Mr. Xu to celebrate his friend's recent marriage. Ni apparently served as a matchmaker for Xu, and he wrote out this poem as a playful wedding gift in which he suggests that Xu's beautiful bride has caused him to neglect his official duties:Commercial boats [are as numerous] as ants,their passengers are like flocks of cranes;[It is because] today the canal was opened even laterthan yesterday.The administrator must have been busy all morning;Apparently, he has never been married to a woman whoseeyebrows are like a distant line of mountains!",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-35897-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49044
Travel on the Silk Road,Yu Ming,early 20th century,"Yu Ming was a close friend of Wu Changshi and worked in Shanghai, primarily as a figure painter.Inscribed simply with the title Travel on the Silk Road, this fan has elements of the story of Lady Wenji (A.D. 2ndC3rd century, as related in the cycle of poems The Eighteen Sons of the Nomad flute). Lady Wenji, the daughter of a Han statesman was abducted and made the wife of a tribal prince of the nomadic Xiongnu. She bore him children and became accustomed to her home on the bleak steppes of Inner Mongolia, far from her people and the civilized Chinese world. When she was finally ransomed she made the agonizing decision to return to her kin and her homeland. The tragic story is frequently retold in poetry and paintings. Ren Yi painted the subject several times, choosing the elements seen in this painting: a camel, the beast of the northern steppes, a vast snowy landscape, and a woman looking out from within a tent.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP161453.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49627

Poem on the Double Ninth ｆestival,Chen Chun,16th century,"One of the most influential flower painters of the Ming dynasty, Chen Chun was also a gifted calligrapher specializing in free-flowing running and cursive scripts. While maintaining remarkable control of columnar spacing and the brush's natural fluctuation, his writing exudes great energy. Having internalized the disciplined stylistic features of both Zhu Yunming (1461C1527) and Wen Zhengming (1470C1559), he cultivated a deliberate casualness that avoided pointed references to earlier masters. Here, his rhythmic brushstrokes echo the cheerful mood of the poem:This year the double ninth is exceedingly brightand clear.Regrettably, the hermit is not in the mountain.My white hair is only good for being covered bymy tattered hat;The yellow flowers are still willing to light mywithered countenance.Thoughts of distant friends increase my sorrow;But I rejoice that nearby fishermen still comeand go.At leisure, I take up a cup to toast the season;Would that these happy moments passmore slowly!(trans. adapted from Tseng Yu-ho Ecke)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153578.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45804
The Pond-Bamboo Dwelling,Lin Yutang,dated 1958,"Lin Yutang brushed this work for his second daughter Taiyi to celebrate the completion of her new book. It is a transcription of two poems, the first one composed by the renowned Buddhist monk Zhongfeng Mingben (1263C1323) and the second by an anonymous Yuan (1279C1368) poet. The poems express a deep appreciation of nature and a laid-back attitude toward life that resonate with Lin's own:I love my dwelling beside water and bamboo.Rugged stones pave the stairs at random;Windows are casually set.Though small in scale,It is clean, quiet, unpretentious, and feels comfortably roomy.What is it like to lay back and be free?Leaning against the balustrade, I watch the fish in the water.Nature is enjoyable with its wind, flowers, snow, and moon.With more free time, I can burn some incense, have some talks, and read some books.Sweep away the dust, but cherish the green moss.Let the red leaves in front of my door cover the stairs.They are worth painting, for they too are wonderful.There are a few pines, a few bamboos, and a few plum trees.Flowers and plants are cultivated to blossom when the time is right.For the future, let Heaven make the arrangements.How can we know when wealth or rank might come?So just relax, follow the course of nature, and be happy.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP146971.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72788
Two Poems,Xu Beihong,dated 1942,"Here, Xu Beihong transcribes two of his own poems for Lin Yutang's daughter, Taiyi:Toward the edge of a lush forest are hundreds of dwellings.Stretching my eyes across the chilly river, I hear evening crows cry.How I love the brimming waters bounding eastward,Which give up their purity for the sands of the Ganges.The Rajmahal palace was built on the Ganges River.I first visited it in the twenty-ninth year of the Republic [1940].The clear sky is especially lovely tonight.Leaning against the window, I feel only the chill of moonlight.Dining by lamplight, life is so difficult,Facing a vase of plum blossoms, I eat my dried biscuits.This was a sketch of my life at the Central University at Shapingju [Shapingba, in Chongqing] in the twenty-seventh year of the Republic [1938]. It has been almost five years since then. Although life is hard, it has improved a little.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)Xu Beihong modeled his calligraphy on the ""singular yet correct"" writing styles of the eras prior to the formalization of rules and methodsduring the Tang dynasty (618C907).

Passage from Tao Qian's "Returning Home",Dong Qichang,未知年代,"Court politics caused Dong Qichang to retire from office three times during his government career. This fan conveys Dong's eloquent response to political intrigue. Quoting a passage from the recluse-poet Tao Qian's (365-427) Returning Home, Dong's spacious and graceful calligraphy reflects his ability to rise above worldly affairs:Then I catch sight of my cottage,filled with joy I run.The servant boy comes to welcome memy little son waits at the door.The three paths are almost obliteratedbut pines and chrysanthemums are still here.Leading the children by the hand I enter my housewhere there is a bottle filled with wine.I draw the bottle to me and pour myself a cup;Seeing the trees in the courtyard brings joy tomy face.I lean on the south window and let my pride expand,I consider how easy it is to be content with alittle space.Every day I stroll in the garden for pleasure,There is a gate there, but it is always shut.(James Robert Hightower, trans.)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153855.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/48957
Canon,Wang Dongling,1991,"Wang Dongling’s work presents a large-scale, broadly-brushed interpretation of the seal-script version of the character for “canon” (fa 法). Before writing the character, Wang first applied ink wash along the upper and lower borders of the paper, leaving an uninked horizontal band in the center. The varied density of the spontaneously applied ink wash gives these passages a rich, atmospheric quality that, according to the artist, is meant to evoke images of the separation of the sky from the earth, as well as periodic autumn floods, as described in the classic Daoist text Zhuangzi (ca. 300 BC).Only after the ink-washed areas had dried did Wang execute the character. Wielding a large brush, Wang wrote out the archaic seal-script form of “canon.” But while seal script, which evolved from seals carved from stone or cast from bronze, is generally composed of lines of uniform width, Wang’s ragged brushstrokes―blurred from puddled ink or streaked from twisted and separated bristles―reasserts the primacy of the brush and the immediacy of the artist’s touch. In another significant departure from tradition, Wang rearranged the character’s usual configuration in order to achieve greater graphic balance. In the standard seal-script form of this complex character, the right and left components are strikingly imbalanced: the righthand component is made up of fifteen brushstrokes, the left only five. In Wang’s reinterpretation, however, one element from the lower right side of the standard character―qu (去 “to go”)―is set above the lefthand element shui (水 “water”), which is, in turn, greatly compressed. The artist integrates his reconfigured glyph by tilting each element inward so that they appear to pivot around the central void, exactly where Wang has placed his seal, which reads Wang Dongling yin (“Seal of Wang Dongling” 王冬g印).Traditional seal script rendering of the fa character:The qu radical:The shui radical:",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP297443.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77940

The Colors of Mount Taihang,Wang Hui,dated 1669,"Wang Hui was born to a family of professional painters who gave him his early training. In his late teens, Wang was discovered by the prominent scholar-painters Wang Jian and Wang Shimin―both former pupils of the towering Dong Qichang―who trained him using their own significant collections of old master paintings. Wang Hui’s early education had prepared him to be a professional painter―a fine existence but one of low status. Under the elder Wangs’ tutelage, he jumped into a different social stratum, where he rubbed shoulders with the most respected men in the realm and eventually painted for the emperor himself.

Clearing after Rain over Streams and Mountains,Wang Hui,dated 1662,"Freely adapting elements traditionally associated with Juran (act. ca. 960C85)―conical mountains defined by ""hemp-fiber"" texture strokes and topped by dense groves or clusters of boulders interspersed with foliage dots―and mixing them with the ""cloudy mountains"" imagery of Mi Youren (1074C1151), Wang has dematerialized the tenth-century master's substantial forms by paring down motifs, flattening forms into calligraphic patterns, and using subtly graded ink washes to evoke a serene landscape cloaked in clouds and mist. While the painting's moist atmosphere is characteristic of Juran, the seamless progression of repeated triangular hills from front to back reveals Wang's method of integrating pictorial elements within a zigzag compositional pattern he called a ""dragon vein.""Done when the artist was only thirty, the luminous ink tones and perfectly controlled lyrical composition are characteristic of works from the artist's early period.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36011-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49150
Flowers in Rain through the Four Stages of Meditation,Xugu (Zhu Huairen),1866,"Four clusters of flowers―orchid, chrysanthemum, narcissus, and peony―hover on this scroll as if emerging from a dense mist. This is one of the earliest extant paintings by Xugu, a scholar of the late Qing dynasty who first pursued a career as a military officer before retreating to life in and around Buddhist monasteries. Xu’s late works are known for nervous, fractured lines, but this piece shows his mastery of the “boneless” technique, in which washes of color are applied without bounding lines. The flowers may symbolize a seasonal progression from summer to spring, but the scholar Cheng Songwan, who gave the painting its title frontispiece, saw a Buddhist significance.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-L_2016_67_55_006_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/737790
The Lingshouhua Studio,Zhao Zhiqian,1863,"Zhao Zhiqian, the leading scholar-artist of his day, grew up in a merchant family but received a classical education in order to pursue a career in government. Passing the provincial civil-service examination in 1859, Zhao spent the next twelve years in Beijing selling his art while trying unsuccessfully to pass the capital examination before being awarded a post as district magistrate in Jiangxi Province in 1872.Zhao was equally renowned as a calligrapher, seal carver, and painter. He is best known for a distinctive ""square-brush"" style of calligraphy derived from the engraved stone writings of the Northern Wei dynasty (386C534), as seen in his dedication and signature here, but he also developed a distinctively plump seal-script manner exemplified by this couplet, which expresses a sentiment appropriate for a Confucian household:Great virtue comes from forbearance,sincerity comes from a mind free from deception.(Jason Sun, translated)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/2000_514_50.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/54308
Dwelling in the Mountains,Xie Zhiliu,Dated 1979,"Xie first became fascinated with the monumental landscape paintings of the Northern Song dynasty (960C1127) in his late twenties and thirties. This work, made when the artist was in his late sixties, attests to the lasting influence of Song masters such as Fan Kuan (act. ca. 990C1030) and Li Tang (ca. 1070sCca. 1150s), particularly in its massive mountain forms defined by emphatic, angular contours and ""axe-cut"" texture strokes. The imposing trees in the foreground, with their twisting trunks and partially exposed roots, also reflect a major motif of the Song pictorial tradition. Xie, however, softened the austere vigor of the Song masters by emphasizing a human presence―evident here in the prominent inclusion of dwellings and a bridge―and by tempering his forceful brushstrokes with rich ink washes. Such subtle variations in tone were achieved after a decade of experimentation with a new method of representation that prioritized the use of ink wash over line and color.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP224432.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72951
"Lotus and Rock, after Chen Hongshou",Xie Zhiliu,Datable to 1937,"This tracing (the bottom portion of which is now missing) reveals how Xie allowed himself some creative license when copying a painting by Chen Hongshou (1599C1652. In tracing the original, Xie paid greatest attention to the outlines of the lotus petals and leaves; he rendered the contours of the rock in a much more cursory manner. This enabled him to use his brush more freely to describe the rock's form and texture, adhering to neither the model nor his tracing while still preserving Chen's original composition. Xie imitated the inscription in the same way: he followed the general forms of the characters without tracing them precisely. In a further departure from the original, Xie used shading in the finished copy to give his rocks greater substance and to emphasize the main rock's central perforation.According to Xie's inscription on the finished version, he copied Chen's painting while he was staying in Nanjing in the spring of 1937.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP224616.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73081
Wrist rest decorated with bamboo,Jin Xiya,1929,"This wrist rest is an excellent example of bamboo carving by Jin Xiya (1890C1979), the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. It showcases Jin’s virtuosic command of traditional bamboo carving. His works incorporate compositions from designs contributed by his contemporary artists, such as Araki Jipo (Japanese, 1872C1944) on this piece. Jin’s works not only represent the highest achievement of bamboo carving in early twentieth century China, but they also preserve a microcosm of the literati world of that time, when members of the scholarly elite sought to sustain inherited traditions in the face of a rapidly modernizing world.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (wrist rest #38), the bamboo carving was completed in the winter of 1929.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-20114-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/839220
Prose Poem on Fishing,Zhu Yunming,dated 1507,"Poet, calligrapher, and bon vivant, Zhu Yunming was one of the most prominent and colorful literary figures of the Ming period.

Prose Poem on Fishing, nearly twenty-seven feet long, is a tour de force of sustained creative energy.

Recluse gazing at a waterfall,Ju Jie,1559,"Ju Jie, a native of Suzhou, studied painting with Wen Jia (1501C1583) but also received instruction from Wen Zhengming (1470C1559), whose style he emulated so successfully that people considered him the master's most talented pupil. After refusing a summons from the eunuch manager of Suzhou's Imperial Silk Manufactury, however, Ju Jie's family was forced into poverty. He subsequently built a small home at the foot of Tiger Hill and lived out his life in relative poverty and ill health―as attested to by his inscription:In the jiwei year of the Jiajing reign on the day of Mild Cold [December 29, 1559] Xuanjin dropped by and produced this paper, pressing me for a painting by my clumsy brush. At the time I was ill and had long neglected brush and inkstone. In a disorderly way I daubed and rubbed; surely one must find it awful. May Xuanjin not be offended with my soiling his beautiful paper.(trans. after Aschwin Lippe)Executed in exquisitely pale, dry brushwork with occasional accents of dark ink, this painting showcases Ju Jie's mastery of Wen Zhengming's refined monochrome landscape style.

Wind among the Trees on the Riverbank,Ni Zan,1363,"Between 1356 and 1366 Ni Zan led a refugee's life, residing with his family southwest of Suzhou at a place he nicknamed the Snail's Hut. Compared to his Wuxi days, this was ""another lifetime,"" but the family was able to settle down to an existence of ""simple sustenance, harmony, and happiness."" His paintings and calligraphy from this period are more assured and relaxed; consequently, they sometimes appear sketchy, a characteristic Ni consciously sought: ""Try to do things in a sketchy manner. Develop forms with a free hand . . . by following your ideas and feelings.""This painting, made for fellow scholar-artist Yu Kan (active 14th century), reflects Ni's spontaneous manner. Painted the same year Ni's wife died, it may also express the artist's growing sense of isolation. His inscription reads:On the riverbank, the evening tide begins to fall;The frost-covered leaves of the windblown grove are sparse.I lean on my staff―the brushwood gate is closed and silent;I think of my friend―the glow is nearly gone from the hills.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT6291.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41154

Landscape for Zhanting,Wang Yuanqi,dated 1710,"A talented landscape painter and theorist, Wang Yuanqi inherited the mantle of orthodoxy from his grandfather, Wang Shimin (1592C1680). A high government official, he also played an important role in establishing the orthodox style as the standard for court painting under the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662C1722).Wang derived his basic composition for this painting from the Yuan master Huang Gongwang (1269C1354), but he reduced the earlier artist's landscape forms to geometric shapes arrayed in twisting and turning echelons that set the entire mountainscape in motion. Contrasting colors and shifting ground planes further animate the composition.Wang's inscription suggests that he took particular pleasure in completing this painting: The way of brush and ink is such that if it is notthe product of lofty and profound ideas and a happy and relaxed mood, when [the artist] adds dots and washes, his mind and hand will not respond to one another. In accord with this principle, the ancients often put away their inkstones and laid aside their brushes, often for years at a time, if the right occasion did not arise. My colleague Zhanting entrusted me with some celi paper a long time ago, but I was distracted by official business. This spring I was recuperating from illness at home. Mr. Zhanting's marvelous medicinal compound worked like the seven stimulants. I recovered immediately, feeling fully vitalized, and was able to fulfill my old promise. I note this in hopes that he will not admonish me for my tardiness.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-13883-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/62743
Five poems,Shitao (Zhu Ruoji),ca. 1700,"Shitao's versatility as a painter is matched by his broad command of ancient script types and individual earlier masters' writing styles. Unlike most of his contemporaries, who wrote in only one or two scripts, Shitao freely varied the script type, style, and scale of his writing to suit format and content.In this fan Shitao emulates the archaic regular script of Zhong You (151C230) in the first part of his text (right half) and Zhong's follower, the fourteenth-century recluse-artist Ni Zan (1306C1374) in the second part (left half). The unmodulated brushstrokes and rectilinear forms convey an air of simplicity and purity well suited to Shitao's poems, which describe his lifelong devotion to poetry, painting, and calligraphy inspite of often straitened circumstances.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153892.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49174
Two eagles,Bada Shanren (Zhu Da),dated 1702,"After decades spent concealing his identity as a descendant of the Ming royal house, Bada Sharen, at the age of seventy-six, seems in this forceful depiction of eagles to be declaring his proud defiance of Manchu Qing rule. There is no immediate precedent for such imagery; instead, the painting harks back to the powerful representations of eagles and hawks created by the early Ming court artist Lin Liang (ca. 1416C1480). Lin's heroic birds are emblems of strength and courage suitable for presentation to military officials. Bada, a fervent Ming loyalist, has personalized this imagery, transforming the conventional symbolism into an expression of brave confrontation and unfaltering loyalty, his noble birds standing sentinel over a landscape now occupied by foreign conquerors",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-19468-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39540
Poem to the Tune of “The Rain-Soaked Bell”,Wang Dongling,2007,"This transcription of a poem by the famed Northern Song poet Liu Yong (柳永, 987C1053) exemplifies Wang Dongling’s command of traditional cursive script. Ten tightly packed columns fill the entire space of the decorated paper and draw our attention to Wang’s energized brushwork. The piece showcases Wang’s unique cursive writing style, in which boldly expansive characters alternate with those that are tightly compressed. These rhythmic shifts in the scale, in which single characters are sometimes expressively unfurled with an emphatic ending stroke of exaggerated length, heightens the sensation of spontaneous execution. Such formal variations enliven the densely written field as the writing undergoes constant compression and expansion. The large characters with their extended endings act like visual punctuations, however they bear no relationship to the text’s content. Such arbitrary shifts in scale hark back to the idiosyncratic cursive styles of Wang Duo (1592C1652) and Fu Shan (1607C1684). But unlike those artists, Wang Dongling did not adopt a traditional handscroll or hanging scroll format. Instead, he chose the challenging square format whose uniformly figured field reveals a modernist sensibility reminiscent of Western action painting.In the final, left-most column, written in a slightly smaller script size, Wang Dongling identifies the source of this text and adds his signature and date. In the traditional manner, he has also impressed two of his seals―one at the beginning and one at the end of the text.Liu Yong’s lyric-poem (ci) to the tune of “The Rain-Soaked Bell, ” in the dinghai year (2007), Wang Dongling in Hangzhou.Seals: Wang Dongling yin (“Seal of Wang Dongling” 王冬g印), lower left; Wuzhai (“Studio of Enlightenment” 悟S , the artist’s style name), upper right.寒sD切。L亭晚，E雨初歇。都Tわow，留偬、m舟催l。淌窒嗫I眼，竟oZ凝噎。念去去、千里波，暮\沉沉楚天。多情自古xe。更那堪、冷落清秋。今宵酒醒何，盍岸、燥L月。此去年，是良辰好景O。便v有、千NL情，更c何人f。柳永雨霖 丁亥王冬g於杭州*Translation by Liu Wu-chi. “The Rain-Soaked Bell” (Yulin Ling 雨霖) is the name of a tune that dictates the format of the poem.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP297444.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77941
Wrist rest decorated with an ear of corn and snail,Jin Xiya,1925,"This wrist rest exemplifies the playfully unconventional approach of Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. Jin meticulously conveyed the textures of the corn stalk, leaves, and kernels by varying the density of striations, such as between the broad lines of a leaf and the denser lines of the sheaf. The artist also enlivened the composition by adding a snail climbing the stalk, and cleverly integrated the inscription by writing it on a leaf.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-20112-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/839218
Rhapsody on the Epang Palace,Wang Chong,1527,"明 王 楷阿房mx  本Though Wang Chong died young, he is remembered for his achievements in semicursive and small standard scripts. This three-leaf album, a rare surviving example of Wang’s small standard script, exhibits the combination of sophistication and strategic na?veté that is admired in his work. In general, Wang follows standard rules of character structure, but, in select spots, he surprises the viewer with a calculated imbalance, weighting a character up or down, left or right. Likewise, his brushwork is angular and sharp in some places, rounded and smooth in others. These subtle shifts operate like inside jokes for students of calligraphy and create an effect at once wise and whimsical, elegant but not slick.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP325293_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/625128

Flowering Calamus and Frogs,Qi Baishi,1950,"Qi Baishi often painted fish, crabs, and shrimp in the early years of his Beijing period (ca. 1920C57), but he seldom painted frogs. As a professional artist, he had to cater to the popular demand for sets of four hanging scrolls, so frogs became his fourth aquatic animal. The frogs in this painting face one another as if engaged in conversation in front of the calamus plant, which is indigenous to their watery habitat. Qi inscribed it with a couplet:By the Starry Pond [Xingdou Tang] were three houses,Where sons and grandsons knew the calamus flowers.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)After moving to Beijing, Qi often drew inspiration from memories of his hometown in Hunan. The ""Starry Pond"" mentioned above refers to his birthplace. The Ming Loyalist Bada Shanren (Zhu Da,1626C1705) had a major influence on Qi Baishi's art. In this painting, the simple, expressive brushwork, strong compositional design, and the frogs' animated expressions are clearly indebted to Bada's psychologically evocative imagery. But Qi infused these traits with his typical warmth and humor. There is also a practical reason for his transformation of Bada's edgy style: his early Bada-inspired paintings were not well received in Beijing, so he tempered the austerity of Bada's influence with an exuberance and cheerfulness derived from the popular manner of Wu Changshuo (1844C1927).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-19327-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72780

Four anecdotes from the life of Wang Xizhi,Zhao Mengfu,1310s,"The emperor Yuan Renzong (r. 1312C20) is said to have remarked that no one could compare with Zhao Mengfu, who possessed seven outstanding qualities: Song royal ancestry, elegant appearance, wide learning, pure character and righteous conduct, literary accomplishment, skill in calligraphy and painting, and profound knowledge of Buddhist and Daoist teachings.As a leading calligrapher, Zhao advocated a return to ancient models, successfully integrating styles of the Jin (265C420) and Tang (618-907) dynasties to create a new synthesis in both regular and cursive scripts. During the fourteenth century, the typefaces of printed books were modeled after his regular script, while his cursive script, seen here, formed the basis for many later writers' informal writing styles.Four Anecdotes from the Life of Wang Xizhi testifies to Zhao's devotion to the ""Sage of Calligraphy,"" Wang Xizhi (303C361).

Wooded Mountains at Dusk,Kuncan,dated 1666,"Born on the Buddha's birthday, Kuncan took Buddhist monastic vows at age twenty-six and became an ardent Chan (Zen) follower. After the establishment of the Qing dynasty, he lived in Nanjing, where his friends included poet-painters who considered themselves loyal ""leftover subjects"" of the vanquished Ming dynasty. In 1659 he visited Yellow Mountain in southern Anhui Province and, inspired by the beauty of the site, decided to devote himself to painting. For Kuncan, painting was a path to the self, and he brought to his art the importance of selfhood espoused by later Chan practitioners.Kuncan's landscapes, painted in the densely textured style of the Yuan master Wang Meng (ca. 1308C1385), are often accompanied by inscriptions that describe a physical, as well as spiritual, mountain journey. In Wooded Mountains at Dusk the artist depicts himself as a wandering pilgrim seated beneath a natural rock bridge:I want to go farther,But my legs are bruised and scratched.The bony rocks appear chiseled,The pines look as if they had been dyed.Sitting down, I feel like a small bird,As I look out at the crowd of peaks gathered before me.Having ascended the heights to the brink of the abyss,I hold fast and ponder the need to sincerely face criticism.Wherever a road ends, I will set myself down,Wherever a source opens, I will build a temple.All this suffices to nourish my eyes,And rest my feet.(Yangming Chu and Maxwell K.

On Zhang Xu,Rao Zongyi,dated 1982,"Benefiting from his family's extensive library in Chaozhou, Guangdong province, Rao Zongyi eventually distinguished himself in extraordinarily diverse fields of scholarship as well as became an accomplished painter and calligrapher.This transcription of three lines from Du Fu's (712C770) ""Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup,"" is typical of Rao's cursive script. The poem celebrates eight free-spirited, heavy-drinking poets and artists. Rao transcribes only that portion concerning Zhang Xu (act. mid-eighth century), the revered ""sage of cursive calligraphy,"" whose wild, gestural writing echoed his eccentric behavior:After three cups [of wine] Zhang Xu demonstrates his repute as the sage of cursive calligraphy.Taking off his hat and exposing his pate in front of the grandees,He sweeps his brush across the paper until [words emerge] like clouds and mist.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)In keeping with the spirit of his subject, Rao wrote this piece in highly expressive cursive script, but, instead of following Zhang Xu, he employed the style of Wang Duo (1592C1652). Wang writes with great speed, but consciously avoids graceful fluidity. Often he pausesand presses down the brush as he begins a stroke or changes its direction, so that his writing is full of angular turns and emphatic pauses that create a tension between spontaneity and deliberateness. Rao adopts these same traits, although he executes them with more restraint.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-29283-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72807

Wang's knowledge of art gained official recognition in 1705, when he and four others were commanded by the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662C1722) to compile a comprehensive study of painting and calligraphy, which was published in 1708 under the title Peiwenzhai shuhua pu. According to Wang Yuanqi's inscription, this painting was inspired by a ""blue-and-green"" landscape by Zhao Mengfu (1254C1322) that belonged to Wang's family collection. Wang's abstract mountain shapes interconnect and coalesce to form surging ""dragon veins,"" through which the ""breath force"" of the mountains is said to flow.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP205729_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49186

The Vimalakirti Sutra,Unidentified artist,"dated January 13, 1119","Throughout Buddhism’s early history in China, the ascetic aspects of the religion―the practice of celibacy and self-deprivation―came into conflict with the Chinese family system and social values. The Vimalakirti Sutra, celebrating the supremely wise layman Vimalakirti, provided canonical proof that enlightenment and salvation were possible even for believers who remained outside monastic orders.In this scroll, which transcribes chapters 5 through 9 of the sacred text, the illuminated frontispiece portrays Vimalakirti seated on a dais preaching to a large audience. He is depicted with the attributes of a traditional Confucian scholar: long beard, fly whisk, and armrest. An inscription at the end of the scroll indicates that it was executed in remote southwest China, present-day Yunnan Province. Lavishly painted and written in gold and silver on purple silk, the scroll was commissioned by the prime minister of the independent kingdom of Dali as a gift for the Chinese ambassador.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP212868_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39958

Lotus,Zhang Daqian,dated 1965,"Throughout his career, Zhang Daqian explored different ways of depicting lotus. Here, he has extended the expressive potential of bravura ink-play pioneered by Xu Wei (1521C1593) and Zhu Da (1626C1705) by adding representational details to abstract patterns of color wash to create an evocative, atmospheric image. He dedicated this work to Lin Yutang with a poetic inscription that reads:Thanks to the silk-washers who did not pluck them,They remain in the rain to shelter the mandarin ducks.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)This image is executed in what Zhang referred to as his ""splashed-ink"" style, which he developed in the mid- 1960s. While this style strongly suggests inspiration from Abstract Expressionism, Zhang never entirely abandoned figuration. He interpreted his formal eclecticism by invoking Laozi: ""Laozi said, 'Procure the essence, and transcend the phenomena.' This state is hard to attain. Images barely emerge out of an elusive haze-that's close enough."" This lotus, which reveals itself through a grayish-blue nebula of saturated color, embodies Zhang's ambitious integration of East and West as well as past and present.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-29419-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72796

Two Paintings of Deer Antlers,Qianlong Emperor,dated 1762 and 1767,"The Qianlong Emperor practiced both calligraphy and painting as a way of identifying himself with Chinese literati ideals of self-cultivation. However, the subject matter of these two scrolls reveals his concomitant desire to align himself with Manchu hunting traditions. Furthermore, the realistic rendering of texture and three-dimensional form reflects the influence of Western pictorial techniques, introduced to the court by Jesuit painters such as Giuseppe Castiglione (1688C1766).The earlier of the two scrolls depicts the antlers of a spotted deer. In his accompanying inscription, the emperor recalls seeing a gigantic pair of eight-point antlers procured by his grandfather, the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661C1722), in Central Asia―considered at the time to be an auspicious sign.The second scroll, painted five years later, presents the horns of a species known in the West as Père David, so named for the eponymous Jesuit missionary and naturalist (1826C1900) who first recorded it in a Western source. In his accompanying essay, Qianlong describes different deer species and seeks to correct misleading distinctions made in the Book of Rites, a classic Confucian text.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP166607_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49250
Weighing Books,Guo Xu,early 16th century,"This disconcerting image of a gentleman selling his books by weight presents a startlingly cynical commentary on the value of scholarship in the increasingly corrupt world of Ming dynasty politics. It may also reflect something of the life of the artist, Guo Xu, who abandoned preparations for an official career to become a painter.The artist's intention remains enigmatic. Does the painting depict the fate of the growing number of well-educated men who, unsuccessful in the civil-service exams, were forced to support themselves as artists, tutors, or professional men of letters? Or is it a sardonic commentary on those members of the bourgeoisie who used their wealth to purchase examination degrees, official appointments, and other trappings of scholarship? Either way, it reflects a new development: the professional artist as social critic. The painting's virtuoso drawing reflects Guo Xu's reputation as a leading artist of his day. Landscape elements, faces, and drapery lines are executed in swift, powerful brushstrokes that still fulfill their descriptive function. The bold composition is likewise carefully crafted to intensify the drama, tightly framing the triangular formation of figures huddled around the scale.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP157066.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39483
Portrait of Li Xiangjun,Cui He,dated 1817,"This painting portrays Li Xiangjun (fl. mid-seventeenth century), a courtesan celebrated for rebuking powerful but treacherous politicians and risking her life to remain chaste for her true love, Hou Fangyu (1618C1654). When a high-ranking official tried to take her by force, Li struck her head against the floor in an attempted suicide. Her blood spattered a fan given to her by Hou, which was later transformed into a painting of peach blossoms. This heroic deed was immortalized in Peach Blossom Fan, a well-known play by Kong Shangren (1648C1718). Above the painting is a transcription of Hou Fangyu's biography of Li.Here Li is shown in her boudoir holding a fan painted with peach blossoms. She leans against a circular opening framed by willow boughs, symbolic of her profession as a courtesan, and a grove of blossoming trees. An open book on the table tells us that she is not only virtuous but also literate.Twelve colophons embellish this scroll, mostly written by scholars from northeastern Zhejiang between 1916 and 1927.

Landscape,Shitao (Zhu Ruoji),dated 1699,"In the inscription on this fan, Shitao sets forth his theory of painting, ""the single stroke,"" or ""the painting of oneness (yihua)"":On a windy, rainy, spring day, I am happy I have no visitors; my hand is free, my mind relaxed and cleansed. The ancients called it yihua, the ""single stroke"": a thousand hills, ten thousand valleys, people, bamboo, trees,a single brushstroke and all is completed. On one level, yihua constitutes a very practical concept: a complete design begins and finishes with the single brushstroke. On a metaphysical level, it suggests that ""myriad strokes are reunited in oneness"" through the mind and hand of the artist and through the artist's spiritual communion with nature.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153893.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49175

Wu was fond of doing ""ink-plays,"" and his drawing shows a cartoonlike simplicity and directness. Accompanying the hermit-fisherman, a symbol of the late Yuan unemployed scholar, Wu Zhen's poetic colophon reads:Red leaves west of the village reflect evening rays,Yellow reeds on a sandy bank cast early moon shadows.Lightly stirring his oar,Thinking of returning home,He puts aside his fishing pole, and will catchno more.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-18549-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41468
Various Subjects,Pan Tianshou,dated 1959,"Pan Tianshou taught himself to paint using the Mustard Seed Garden Manual before receiving instruction in college from Li Shutong (Hongyi, 1880C1942), the pioneering teacher of Western-style painting. In 1925 Pan went to Shanghai, where he met Wu Changshi (1844C1927), who instructed him in seal- and clerical-script calligraphy. In 1928 Lin Fengmian (1900C1991) appointed Pan to the faculty of the newly founded Hangzhou Art Academy as professor of traditional painting. Pan remained at the academy for the rest of his life, serving as director from 1959 to 1971, when he was persecuted and died during the Cultural Revolution.This handscroll exemplifies Pan's ability to create a formal language to express his emotions. Although his subject matter illustrates the traditional theme of the four seasons and his depictions recall the brush idioms of Ming and Qing scholar-artists, his exaggerated forms and angular calligraphy embody his fiercely independent spirit.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP205411_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42036
Sketches of Shatian,Huang Binhong,20th century,"In this album, Huang Binhong uses a remarkably fresh linear style to depict a series of famous mountain sites in China. A consummate literatus, Huang Binhong had his first opportunity to travel extensively when he was in his sixties. He produced thousands of sketches in response to new sights and transformed his style, shedding the traditional vocabulary of brushstrokes, unlearning what he had cultivated for years, to develop through contour drawing a more direct means of depicting what he saw. This series of sketches utilizes the popular travel gazetteer format, typically published in woodblock print editions.These landscape compositions are ""picturesque"" in a sense defined by a long tradition of landscape art in China. Huang's means of defining form by delineating edges without texture patterning and recording with the hand what the eye traces, however, is a radical departure for Chinese painting. It proved an interim step for Huang Binhong on his road to a late landscape style in which the qualities of ink were again exploited and ink resumed its traditional place alongside brushline as the paired tools of description and expression.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP162575_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49643
Invitation to Reclusion at Jingxi,Dong Qichang,1611,"In this short handscroll, the artist-theorist Dong Qichang turns landscape forms into calligraphic abstractions. In the right half of the scroll, interlocking wedge-shaped masses create the illusion of a logical spatial recession. In the second half of the painting, logic is abandoned: ground planes shift, changes in scale are capricious, frequent contrasts between light and dark ink deny the blurring effects of atmosphere, and the illusion of recession is confounded by flat patterns of brushwork and patches of blank paper that continually assert the two-dimensionality of the picture surface.As the painting's title suggests, the scroll invites the viewer on a journey that leads not only from illusionism to abstraction but from the external world of appearances to the inner world of the recluse's mind. In so doing, it visualizes the disparate worlds between which both the artist and the scroll's recipient, Dong's longtime friend Wu Zhengzhi (d. ca. 1619), must choose. In a long colophon inscribed after the painting, Dong praises Wu, who, like himself, chose to withdraw from government service to live in retirement:I am like clouds returning to the mountain,You are like the rising sun.To go forth [and serve] or abide at home,Either is appropriate.Why must one live [in isolation like] the crane and gibbon?Only those who shun this world,Can live out their days in the Peach Blossom Spring [an idyllic community of hermits celebrated in poetry by Tao Qian (365C427)].",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP216493_94.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41479

Poetic Maxim,Zheng Fu,dated 1691,"Zheng Fu, a Nanjing native, lived through the fall of the Ming dynasty and elected to practice medicine rather than to study for the civil-service examinations. He was best known for his large-scale clerical script writings, as exemplified by this hanging scroll. A pioneer in the revival of interest in Han dynasty (206 B.C..CA.D. 220) stele writings, Zheng traveled to Shandong and Hebei Provinces in search of original stones, inspiring the playwright Kong Shangren (1648C1718) to compose a poem about Zheng’s obsession. In addition to creating independent works of calligraphy, Zheng was also much sought after to execute large-character frontispieces for paintings.This piece quotes Jiao Gan’s (act. 86C34 B.C.) poetic explanation of one of the trigrams in the Book of Changes (Yi Jing). The text offers an inspiring sentiment suitable for a gentleman’s studio.He who acts like the single-minded cuckoo willnot make mistakes.If a gentleman upholds this code of conduct,he will enjoy a happy and long life.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP146576.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/65630

Spring Dawn over the Elixir Terrace,Lu Guang,ca. 1369,"To escape the turbulence of the closing years of the Yuan dynasty, Lu Guang traveled far from his native city of Suzhou. He painted Spring Dawn after his return to the Lake Tai area, following the establishment of the Ming dynasty in 1368. The reference to the Elixir Terrace in the title of the painting indicates the artist's interest in both Daoist alchemy and the pursuit of immortality; the poem, which describes ""elixir rays emitted from a well turning into [auspicious] clouds at dawn,"" expresses Lu's optimism in the new era. In the city of Wuxing in 1369, Lu Guang saw and inscribed an important painting attributed to Yan Wengui (act. ca. 980-1010). Although Spring Dawn, which was painted about the same time, shows the influence of Yan Wengui's monumental composition, Lu Guang's brushwork is utterly different from the Northern Song descriptive style.

The Strange Pines of Mount Tiantai,Dai Benxiao,1687,"A refuge since its discovery in the fourth century, Mount Tiantai is a legendary dwelling place of Buddhist holy men; its natural stone bridge is a fabled point of connection between this world and the paradise of the immortals. Dai Benxiao, whose Ming-loyalist father committed suicide after being injured in a battle against Qing forces, focuses here on the mountain's pines. Symbolic of survival in times of adversity, the pines, having been suddenly threatened, reflect the artist's uncertainty about his ability to find spiritual sanctuary in a world from which he feels alienated:The strangely shaped pine trees of Mount Tiantai have been depicted by artists of previous periods. . . . I have decided to portray this theme, drawing upon my own imagination. I have heard recently that most of these strange pines have met the sad fate of extinction. It seems that once the natural wonders of the sky, earth, mountains, and rivers are exposed to the intimate scrutiny of the dusty world, they do not last long.

Mountain Landscape,Wang Duo,dated 1651,"Wang Duo, believing that ""the creation of extraordinary landscape scenery comes first,"" returned to the monumental landscape motifs of the Northern Song to express his dissatisfaction with Dong Qichang's (1555C1636) credo: ""In considering the wonders of brush and ink, landscape cannot compete with painting."" This scroll, executed one year before Wang's death, is an eloquent statement of his fondness for pictorial content. Known more for his calligraphy than for his painting, Wang reduced the rich detail of tenth- and eleventh-century landscapes to simple graphic conventions. Heavily contoured trees, many with leafless, stubby branches; schematic dotting on the summits of the mountain peaks; and starkly outlined rock formations all recall the tenth century master Fan Kuan. The prominence of figures, buildings, and pathways, in striking contrast to the generally uninhabited landscapes of Dong Qichang, emphasizes the Song idea that paintings should be places in which to wander and dwell.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-1985_214_149-02.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49030

Farewell Poem,Wang Ao,dated 1498,"Wang Ao, a native of Suzhou, was one of the most famous literary figures of his day.

Wu had been deputized by the emperor to serve as an honorary escort to his uncle Xu Pu (1428C1499), when Xu retired from the Grand Secretariat. Following the poem, Wang added a note describing this event and signed the piece with all his court titles, thus transforming a private gift into a powerful public testimonial of Wu's honorary role as the emperor's emissary.As befits this kind of formal presentation piece, Wang wrote his text in dramatic large-scale characters that show off to maximum advantage his distinctive style of lean angular brushwork with its sharp firm movements.

Early Spring,Gu Yuan,1979,"The freshness and insouciance of early spring is conveyed here in an exquisite lacework of fine tree branches and its rippled reflection in a lake. This lyrical print differs radically from the artist’s early works with explicit political references, such as Burning up Land Deeds (cat. no. 66). Produced one year after Deng Xiaoping announced his political and economic reforms in 1978, it attests to the catalytic power of politics on the arts.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/PI_077.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77048

His depiction of the Gathering at the Orchid Pavilion is unusual in that it is painted on figured damask, silk woven with a pictorial pattern. This type of support is rarely used for paintings because the dueling images of the silk ground and the painting can be difficult for the eye to parse.

The Sound of Spring in a Lonely Valley,Hongren,1661,"Inscriptions after the artist (right): ""The Sound of Spring in a Lonely Valley, the first lunar month of spring in the xinchou year [January 30CFebruary 28, 1661], painted for the gentleman Jiaoru, Hongren"" and after Chen Shu [jinshi degree, 1649, left] Hongren, a filial son who helped support his mother after his father's premature death, passed the local civil-service examination during the late Ming period but ended his pursuit of an official career after the fall of the dynasty in 1644. Becoming a Buddhist monk as a way of avoiding service under the Manchus, Hongren spent the rest of his life in his native Anhui Province, where he became the central figure in the so-called Anhui School of painters, whose common bond was their fascination with the rugged scenery of Yellow Mountain (Mount Huang).Hongren favored a dry linear technique that echoes the style of the Yuan dynasty recluse-painter Ni Zan (1306C1374). In this scroll Ni's influence is apparent in the spindly foreground trees and angular rock formations. The diminishing scale of the trees helps define recession and emphasizes the overwhelming size of the towering cliff at center, which dominates the composition and imparts a monumentality similar to that of the grandly scaled peaks of Northern Song (960C1127) works.While the painting has long been admired as an original Hongren, weaknesses in the brushwork of the calligraphy and landscape forms suggest that it is actually a close copy.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36009-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40020

Stealing the Orchid Pavilion Manuscript,Fu Xiaoshi,ca. 1970s,"Fu Xiaoshi belongs to the youngest generation represented in the Ellsworth collection―the generation that came of age during the decades of purge and Cultural Revolution. Fu Xiaoshi, as the son of Fu Baoshi had a privileged position that included training in traditional Chinese painting as well as a degree from the Central Academy of Fine Arts. While a student however, his criticism of the government earned him confinement to a labor camp, and during the Cultural Revolution he was sentenced to jail as a counter-revolutionary.This painting belongs to the period after the mid-1970s when Fu began to paint with his left hand because of a stroke. The subject of the painting is a familiar one: Emperor Taizong (r. 627C49) was fanatical about owning all famous versions of the Lanting manuscript, a set of poems written by Wang Xhizhi (4th century) after a day-long gathering of literati. He sent his Minister Xiaoyi to retrieve a copy kept illicitly by the monk Bianzai. The minister posing as a visitor to the temple, waits with a warrant up his sleeve, ready to pounce the moment the greedy monk reveals where the manuscript is hidden. In this painting, the monk, casually flourishing his flywhisk is unable to resist boasting about his treasure. The tension and psychological acuity of Fu's painting are striking, as is the absence of the common tendency in contemporary Chinese painting toward exaggeration or caricature.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-33236-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49797

Two hawks in a thicket,Lin Liang,mid- 15th century,"One of the leading court painters of bird-and-flower scenes, the Cantonese artist Lin Liang specialized in bold, expressive, monochrome depictions of birds in the wild.Never before had there been such hawks as those painted by Lin Liang. Standing like monuments to strength and courage on the highest frozen peaks swept by bitter winds, living in worlds that lesser creatures could not inhabit, Lin's great birds are embodiments of heroism. In contrast to his usual image of hawks silhouetted against the sky and surveying their surroundings from a high perch, however, these noble birds appear withdrawn and reclusive, inviolable and inaccessible, as if lost in a dense forest of old trees and thick bamboo where no one could possibly reach them.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP157342.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45676

Dai Jin was one of the last major masters to embody the artistic traditions of the Southern Song Imperial Painting Academy, but he was also a very versatile painter who drew inspiration from diverse sources. In this painting, the manner of outlining forms with a gentle sinuous line, the large and powerful deciduous trees, and the scale of the figure in relationship to the setting recall the works of the Yuan artist Sheng Mou (act. ca. 1310C60).The tendency toward swift, sketchy, cursive brushwork here is a hallmark of Dai Jin's later work. Dai sometimes painted precariously close to the edge of control, creating a distinctively kinesthetic, movement-filled style that was fresh and new and that would greatly influence later Ming professional painting.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP274156.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44699

Crooked Pine,Wu Zhen,dated 1335,"Because it retains its greenery even in the dead of winter, the pine symbolizes endurance and fortitude.

He chose instead to live in reclusion in the mountains of Zhejiang Province. Calling himself the Plum Blossom Daoist (Meihua Daoren), he made a humble living through the practice of divination.In his inscription, Wu describes the source of his inspiration for this painting:In winter, the eleventh lunar month of the third year of theYuantong reign era [December 1335], while visiting theCloudy Grotto, I saw a crooked and twisting ancient tree.So I wrote this picture to record what I saw.

Peach Blossom Spring,Zhang Hong,dated 1638,"""Peach Blossom Spring,"" as first told by the poet Tao Qian (365C427), is the tale of a fisherman who, having followed a stream lined with blossoming peach trees, stumbles upon an idyllic community that for generations has been sequestered from political and social upheavals. He eventually takes his leave, but when he tries to find the stream again, it has vanished.In Zhang Hong's keenly observed interpretation, the viewer is led from a winding stream through a cloudbank to the spot where the fisherman, oar in hand, first encounters the sheltered people, whose clothing styles haven't changed since the Qin dynasty (221C207 B.C.). The remainder of the scroll lovingly examines the ageless rhythms of rural life, especially those related to rice cultivation and silk production. Painted just six years before the collapse of the Ming dynasty, this vision of a utopian world must have been especially appealing.Zhang Hong, a native of Suzhou, was an accomplished landscape and figure painter who became known as a Ming loyalist in the early years of the Manchu Qing dynasty (1644C1911).

Li’s love of blossoming plum was such that he named his studio the Plum Blossom Tower; it was there, in 1743, that he made this painting. The poem reads, in part:The mist engulfing the empty mountains hasn’t dissipated at dawn.In the dim light it reflects upon itself whose talent is appreciated by none other.Exemplary of the spirit against winter’s bitter cold, it cannot be subdued.New signs have arrived from heaven.―Translation by Shi-yee Liu",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/1971_256_O.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49247

In proposing a ""great synthesis"" of all ancient landscape idioms, Dong turned landscape forms into calligraphic abstractions. The most desirable element in painting, according to Dong, was brushwork rather than representation: ""If one considers the wonders of brush and ink, real landscape can never equal painting.""This painting is an interpretation of the Yuan master Ni Zan's (1306C1374) art.

""Plucking the cassia"" was a metaphor for such success. A fall flower, the cassia was usually associated with the provincial examinations, traditionally held in the autumn. The red vine leaves identify this as an autumnal scene.The painting presents Zheng Zichong in his garden. Half hidden by the wall of his studio, he appears in rapt contemplation of the scenery. The rustic structures and fence indicate the simple but elegant taste of the Ming scholar; a cabinet full of scrolls visible through the window shows his appreciation of the arts.

Recluse playing the zither in a pine grove,Wen Zhengming,ca. 1540,"Wen Zhengming was the most influential Suzhou painter of the sixteenth century.

In Playing the Qin in the Shade of the Pines, one of Wen's largest works, the freely executed boulders and impressionistically rendered trees coalesce into powerful interlocking forms when viewed, as intended, from across a spacious hall. The scroll is roughly contemporaneous with Wen's equally large calligraphic scrolls of the late 1520s, which were commissioned by the Jiajing emperor (r. 1522C66).Playing the seven-string zither (qin), a versatile instrument able to suggest nature's sounds, is associated with the solitary self-cultivation and reclusive existence of the scholar.

Record of the Following One's Ancestor Studio,Zheng Yuanyou,dated 1345,"This text, written when scholars living in retirement became intimately identified with their gardens or studios, is a rare fourteenth-century example of a new literary genre, the ""studio memoir."" But as Zheng's brief postscript makes clear, the essay was also intended to function as a letter of introduction for its recipient, an aspiring young student named Xu Huan. In the postscript, Zheng asks Xu Huan to show the scroll to a high-ranking official who might help Xu with an appointment. By adopting the form of a studio history in his essay, Zheng is able to discuss Xu Huan's illustrious family background and virtuous intentions while maintaining a tasteful and face-saving indirectness.The elegance of Zheng Yuanyou's calligraphy reflects the refined sensibilities of both the writer and the recipient. Zheng was among the first to develop a distinctive new calligraphic style of elongated characters and exaggerated turning strokes and hooks that was based on late Han dynasty archaic models. This antiestablishment style is commonly associated with Zheng's most famous pupil, the recluse-artist Ni Zan (1306C1374), who made it synonymous with scholars living in retirement. Zheng's early use of this style suggests that it was not Ni's personal invention but a widespread cultural phenomenon expressive of the reclusive spirit of the times.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/1994_308_S2_d.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42329
"Remote Valleys, Sounds of Waterfalls, Deep Forests",Liu Yu,dated 1678,"Liu Yu, a Nanjing native, is not listed among the Eight Masters of Jinling (Nanjing), but he belonged to the same circle of leading collectors and artists active in the city during the late seventeenth century, when it was a vital center for the arts. Liu developed an eclectic style that combined the dry, linear brushwork of the Nanjing individualist Gong Xian (1619C1689) with the landscape forms and brush idioms of the Orthodox master Wang Hui (1632C1717). Liu further enlivened his integration of stylistic sources with playful shifts in scale and spatial distortions―visual effects intended to convey his ""scholarly amateurism."" Like other Nanjing masters of the time, Liu balanced his commitment to calligraphic abstraction with the desire to make his pictures visually appealing.Here, alternating familiar scenes of human habitation with dramatic depictions of natural scenery, he created a landscape that engages viewers and transports them to another world.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP210925_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/62739

Yet Li Hua achieved an even greater visual intensity by maximizing light effects and employing engraving techniques.Li Hua assumed a leadership role in the first stage of the Modern Woodcut Movement in the early 1930s, creating some of the most iconic woodblock prints of the prewar period.

Fragrant Snow at Broken Bridge,Wang Mian,14th century,"An ambitious scholar, Wang Mian was determined to fulfill his responsibilities as a man of talent despite the frustrations and dangers of life under Mongol rule. He studied philosophy, military tactics and politics. He wrote poems and government treatises, drew up battle plans and painted unforgettable images of the flowering plum that became the principal model for plum painters of Ming and Qing times.In this painting, Wang Main brought into balance the expressive and representational elements of his subject, for in depicting silken blossoms and rough branches, he employed both the delicately descriptive techniques of his academic predecessors and the bold calligraphic brushwork of his literati contemporaries.The flowering plum (Prunus mume, or Japanese apricot) became an object of intense enthusiasm during the Southern Song dynasty and has remained one of China's favorite motifs. Blooming before all other trees, it was welcomed as the harbinger of spring. By Wang Mian's time, under the impact of the barbarian Mongol rule, the image of the flowering plum blossoming in the withered winter landscape, had become a powerful symbol of purity and endurance in adversity.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP258037.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40080

This handscroll, which he titled Discourse on Painting, is not a technical treatise but rather a reflective essay on what sort of person should pursue the art of painting. The highest good, says Fa, is to pursue service to society through government. If, however, one is unskilled in practical affairs, one should then study the classics; only if one fails at that should one pursue the life of a painter.

At the same time, the Qianlong emperor considered him to be one of the outstanding painters of the age. In over twenty years' service at court, Qian Weicheng produced more than 275 paintings for the emperor. Even after Qian's death in 1772, the emperor continued, as on this album, to add appreciative inscriptions.This album originally formed part of a four-volume set depicting scenery and flowers of the four seasons.

Landscape in the style of Huang Gongwang,Wang Shimin,1666,"This major work represents the culmination of Wang Shimin’s lifelong study of the paintings of Huang Gongwang (1269C1354). Reducing Huang’s calligraphic style to a graphic formula―rock forms filled with straight, parallel, “hemp-fiber” texture strokes and layers of horizontal dots―Wang Shimin built his kinetic brush patterns into rising and falling, opening and closing, “breath-force” (qishi) movements. Individual texture strokes and foliage dots crisscross, multiplying and expanding until the entire composition turns into a great flowing pattern of undulating forces and counterforces that suggests nature’s boundless energy and growth.Wang Shimin was the eldest of the “Four Wangs”―the others being Wang Jian (1598C1677), Wang Hui (1632C1717), and Wang Yuanqi (1642C1715).

Landscape in the Style of Guo Xi,Tan Song,dated 1748,"Except for this painting, there are no other known references to the artist Tan Song. According to his inscription, he was inspired by the brush idiom of the eleventh-century landscape master Guo Xi. But it is clear from the painting’s style, content, and date that Tan was a close follower of Yuan Jiang (act. 1680C1730) and Yuan Yao (act. 1730Cafter 1778) and may well have assisted them in the family studio. Tan’s painting is modeled on similar compositions by both of the Yuans that also invoke Guo Xi as their stylistic source and similarly feature heavily laden ox carts moving through the mountains. Yet in his eagerness to emulate these masters, Tan Song has created a caricature of their manner. In Tan’s hands the Yuans’ exuberant style of brushwork for defining landscape features has become a frothy profusion of nervous squiggles and curlicues that no longer describe substantial forms. The same tendency toward overelaboration is also apparent in the profusion of narrative elements and genre details that Tan has scattered throughout his composition, including two oxcarts whose illogical destination seems to be the crest of the central peak.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/13_220_122.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49230

Couplet on an Autumn Sky,Emperor Lizong,未知年代,"Lizong was the finest calligrapher among the Song emperors who came after Gaozong (r. 1127C62). While his predecessors followed Gaozong's style, Lizong developed his own unique manner, which was distinguished by angular brushstrokes with straight rapid brush movements―in contrast to the slower, more rounded brushstrokes of Gaozong―and by his preference for Tang, rather than Jin, dynasty models.This couplet may well describe the beauty of West Lake, site of the Southern Song imperial palace:Deep in the autumn, waters are clear to the bottom [of the lake],After rain, blueness extends across the sky.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153488.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40185

Paragons of Loyalty and Filial Piety,Wang Shanggong,1593,"Illustrations of historical paragons of piety and loyalty have been an important method of transmitting those virtues since at least the Han dynasty (206 B.C.CA.D. 220). In the eleventh century, the scholar-artist Li Gonglin (ca. 1041C1106) gave new meaning to this tradition with his Classic of Filial Piety, in which simple monochrome drawings not only illustrate the text but also present subtle commentaries on contemporary society. In this painting, Wang Shanggong, a little-known artist from Suzhou, reinvigorated the role of artist as social critic by reviving the Li Gonglin tradition in both subject matter and style. Living under the rule of the Wanli emperor (r. 1573C1620), who refused to come to court for the last twenty-five years of his reign, Wang presented interpretations of important themes, such as officials admonishing their ruler and the emperor receiving his ministers, which must have held particular significance for his contemporaries. Wang's extraordinarily fine baimiao (plain-drawing) style was inspired by the monochrome drawing method of Li Gonglin but attained a new level of gossamer thinness and delicacy that anticipates the stylistic innovations of such better-known late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century artists as Ding Yunpeng, Wu Bin, and Chen Hongshou.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP204868_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/48947
Enjoying the Wilderness in an Autumn Grove,Ni Zan,dated 1339,"Until the early 1340s, Ni Zan lived the life of a wealthy dilettante, spending his time among the precious books, antiques, and flowers of his Pure and Secluded Pavilion. His painting style at the time, as seen here, exhibits a studied archaism in which his interest in descriptive detail is at odds with his self-conscious use of calligraphic ""hemp fiber"" brushstrokes in the manner of tenth-century masters. Ni's gentleman seated in a rustic pavilion is shorthand for the scholar in his studio. His florid poem exhibits a similarly precious quality of one entirely absorbed in his immediate surroundings. It reads, in part:In the bright days, bamboo wave in the breeze;In the dark nights, parasols of fir hold up the moon.Burning incense I use [a censer in the form of] a gilded duck;Gathering scattered petals, I place them inside my pillow.(trans.

A leading patron of contemporary artists, Zhou assembled a number of these albums during the last twenty-five years of his life, when his career required him to travel extensively. Such collaborative works have long been a means for a group of artists to commemorate special occasions, but Zhou’s albums, which sometimes encompassed hundreds of contributions, fulfilled a different function: they included works by professionals and scholar-amateurs, Ming loyalists and Qing officials, traditionalist orthodox painters and innovative individualists.

Returning Fishermen,Tang Di,dated 1342,"The paintings of Tang Di, a scholar and official at the Yuan court, range from ink drawings on paper to largescale colored works on silk. A fellow townsman and follower of the scholar-painter Zhao Mengfu (1257C1322), Tang won praise from Emperor Renzong (r. 1312C20) for his part in the decoration of the Yuan imperial palace.Returning Fisherman is a fine example of Tang Di's monumental decorative style. Tang executed the scroll in the conservative brush idiom of the Northern Song masters Li Cheng (919C967) and Guo Xi (ca. 1000Cca. 1090), building forms with the principal motifs of the earlier style, ""crab-claw"" branches and ""billowing-cloud"" rocks.

Eight landscapes,Lu Han,1699,"Almost nothing is known of Lu Han, the painter of this album, but the style of the landscapes indicates he studied the work of his contemporary Wang Hui (1632C1717).

"Bamboo, old tree, and rock",Wu Zhen,dated 1338,"This painting shows Wu Zhen's creative adaptation of the ""old tree, bamboo, and rock"" genre first canonized by eleventh-century scholar-artists. The painting's large scale and use of overlapping forms and graded ink tones to create an illusion of recession, and of rich, wet ink to evoke the appearance of foliage after a drenching rain, recall the descriptive naturalism of Song-dynasty precedents. But Wu tempered this naturalistic approach with a new calligraphic assertiveness inspired by the work of Zhao Mengfu (1254C1322). Bamboo leaves have been reduced to a calligraphic formula of repeating, pattern-like clusters, and the texture strokes and foliage dots used to describe rock surfaces have become emphatic mannerisms derived from the tenth-century masters Dong Yuan and Juran.In his later years, Wu Zhen specialized in bamboo painting, but even here, in his earliest extant depiction of bamboo, the artist's admiration for this plant is evident, particularly in his poetic inscription:Tall stalks pierce the clouds.Perhaps you find it strange,Not recognizing the wings of a phoenix.A pure sound enters the realm of the soundless,Do not let Zhonglang blow his long-necked flute.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP235590.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39547

Landscapes in the styles of old masters,Gao Cen,1667,"Gao Cen was among the most accomplished of the so-called Eight Masters of Nanjing.

Perpetuating a tradition of topographic painting practiced during the late Ming, Gao produced works to supply the growing demand for mementos of Nanjing's fabled sights, including places with nostalgic links to the city's glory days under the Ming. A sensitive recorder of the familiar, Gao was also an innovative experimenter with light, atmosphere, and color whose art reflects a creative response to Western influences introduced by Jesuits such as Matteo Ricci (1552C1610). Gao's wistful, atmospheric landscapes are noteworthy for seamlessly fusing descriptive realism and poetic feeling to achieve exquisite evocations of place and mood.Gao's works are rare today and this album, which captures aspects of Nanjing's scenery at different times of year and in varied weather conditions, is one of his finest.

Strolling in a Misty Valley,Mei Qing,1649,"Mei Qing was born into a prominent family in Xuancheng, Anhui Province, about seventy-five miles south of Nanjing. Mei followed the family tradition of scholarship. By age sixteen he had become a prefectural-level student (zhusheng), and in 1642 he published his first collection of poems. He lived in retirement during the first decade of the Qing dynasty.Strolling in a Misty Valley is Mei’s earliest extant work, done shortly after he moved to a new family residence in a scenic area south of Xuancheng. The painting shows him working in the dry, linear style typical of a number of late Ming painters, with angular rock formations and craggy pines loosely organized along a serpentine stream. Its style vaguely recalls the landscape forms of Huang Gongwang (1269C1354) and the spare brush idiom of Ni Zan (1306C1374). Painted just five years after the fall of the Ming dynasty, its allusions to these recluse-artists, who lived under the Mongol Yuan dynasty, clearly signal Mei’s own situation and loyalist sentiments.Above the peaks, Mei inscribed a poem and dedication:In the valley clouds and mist often obscure one’s view,I am pleased that the pines and rocks in front of my door are peaceful.My song over, I drag my staff along as I cross the stream;My picture captures the green mountains, I look upon it with satisfaction.On an autumn day in the jichou year [1649],I present this to my teacher Old Li for his instruction.The Daoist of Qushan, Mei Qing",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT375239.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36453

Joys of the Fisherman,Wang Fu,ca. 1410,"A twelfth-century couplet inscribed on the wall of a tavern characterized the lives of the fisherman and the scholar-official:Right and wrong reach not where men fish;Glory and disgrace dog the official riding his horse.To painters living in the tumultuous days of the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties, the theme of the fisherman symbolized a perfect escape from their strife-torn world. Wang Fu, a fellow townsman of Ni Zan (1306C1374), returned to Wuxi in 1401, after twenty years of exile at the desolate northern outpost of Datong, Shanxi Province; like Ni Zan, he had been a wanderer in his native land. In this long scroll Wang echoes Wu Zhen's (1280C1354) treatment of the fisherman theme.

Beauty about to bathe,Unidentified artist,18th century,"Partially clad in a diaphanous robe, a woman with an elaborate coiffure perches on the edge of a bamboo couch. A red candle burning in a sconce indicates that the time is evening. A basin of blossoming orchids at her right may symbolize hidden beauty, seductive fragrance, or scholarly talent, while the books at the woman’s right elbow bespeak her learning. At bottom left, a bath is being filled, seemingly by an unseen attendant who assists from offstage.The picture is risqué in several respects. The sheer robe, decorated with a translucent pattern of bamboo, reveals much of the woman’s body, including her breasts and legs. Her bound feet―a highly charged erotic theme in premodern Chinese literature and art―are emphasized by her red shoes. More subtle but perhaps equally outré is the open-mouthed expression of the beauty, which reveals her bare teeth, an exceptionally rare and provocative feature for a premodern Chinese figure painting.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-34238-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/910544
Dew-Moistened Pearls,Wu Changshuo,dated 1922,"Flowering wisteria vines were a favorite subject of Wu Changshuo, who reveled in painting the wildly tangled vines and cascading bundles of blossoms.

Red Cliffs and Green Valleys,Wang Meng,ca. 1367,"Wang Meng’s grandfather Zhao Mengfu was one of the first artists to make landscape paintings that referred knowingly to earlier styles. This idea, simple on its face but revolutionary in its impact, required not just a knowledge of art history but the ability to forge something new out of it, and it became the dominant mode for ambitious landscape painters going forward. This intimately scaled hanging scroll shows Wang Meng working in this vein, using ropy texturing brushstrokes and vigorous dotting to refer to elements of his grandfather’s style and to those still-earlier painters who had inspired it.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36789-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45637

This noble bird, perched on a pinnacle overlooking distant mountains, is accompanied by a monumental seal-script title that evokes associations of both patriotism and longevity.Wu used diluted ink dots to describe the birds' plumage.

Such images, with their sumptuous colors and symbolic associations with beauty, prosperity, and good fortune, appealed to the tastes of the new urban consumer. Zhao often painted on folding fans, a format popular during the later Ming and Qing dynasties, when fans became fashionable accoutrements for gentlemen.Peony, an image that connotes material prosperity and good fortune, introduces the boldness and simplicity of seal carving and early stone-carved scripts to painting.

Viewing the Tide,Yang Yongliang,2008,"Yang Yongliang’s photo collages combine the visual language of premodern landscape painting with digital techniques to engender moments of shock and surprise. Viewing the Tide faithfully follows the composition of Zhao Fu’s (active 12th century) Ten Thousand Li of the Yangzi River (Palace Museum, Beijing), but close examination reveals that the majestic mountains are composed of countless high-rise apartments, while the trees are actually power-line towers and construction cranes. In this dystopic vision of a landscape overrun by human development, the surging river at the end of the scroll seems to express nature’s wrath rather than her majesty―a tsunami come to sweep the excesses of humankind from the face of the earth.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-13231-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/653467
Washing a Horse,Fu Baoshi,dated 1943,This painting alludes to the lofty scholar-artist Ni Zan (1306C1374) and his obsession with cleanliness.

Poem on reclusion,Zhou Lianggong,dated 1663,"Poems of reclusion often celebrate country living, from the delights of physical labor to the passing of the seasons. In this poem written for Geng Jie (1622C1693), Zhou describes his friend as a gentleman-farmer who tends willows, chrysanthemums, and rice when he is not writing poetry to satisfy his creative spirit.

Poem,Yu Youren,undated,"Yu Youren wrote this poem in the ""standardized"" cursive script that he developed in the 1930s. While benefiting from his solid discipline in the stele tradition of calligraphy, Yu's round brushwork brims with inner strength and taut resilience in a style that is more raw than refined. The center of structural gravity of individual characters tends to be lower than normal to enhance their stability. The principal horizontal, vertical, or diagonal stroke in each character exudes sweeping power and weight.Yu Youren's poetry in traditional genres ranks among the best in the Republican era. He insisted that poetry be easily accessible and employ rhyme schemes and tonal regulations used in modern Mandarin. In simple language, he invested his best works with intense emotions that are deeply moving but never sentimental such as the one transcribed here:I don't believe that youth cannot be retrieved.I will not allow our past glory to turn to ashes.Recalling the banquet in Shanghai celebrating our victory,I toast the ten thousand miles of streams and mountains with a cup of wine.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-29530-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72785

In his longer inscription he transcribed the text of Summer Song, composed by the poet and official Huangfu Fang (1503C1582).

Hermit-Fisherman on a Spring River,Lan Ying,dated 1632,"Known as the last major Zhe School professional painter, the Hangzhou artist Lan Ying was sufficiently influenced by late Ming scholar-painting aesthetics to have devoted most of his creative energy to painting in the idioms of the Song and Yuan masters. In this self-titled work, for example, Lan invokes the theme of life in reclusion celebrated in many paintings by Yuan scholar-artists.Unlike the works of the Wu School scholar-painters, however, Lan Ying’s paintings emphasize technical virtuosity and coloristic effects.

Bodhisattva Guanyin in the Form of the Buddha Mother,Chen Hongshou,dated 1620,"In Esoteric Buddhism, the Buddha is understood as having been born of the Law, which is regarded, therefore, as the Buddha Mother. This image depicts the Esoteric manifestation of Guanyin (Avalokiteshvara, in Sanskrit) as the Buddha Mother, a deity with multiple arms and a third ""all-seeing"" eye. In Chen Hongshou's interpretation, however, the Buddha Mother does not appear as a formidable incarnation of scripture but as a winsome young woman. Her unruly hairdo and the unconventional gesture of clutching strands of hair in her mouth may derive from heroines of contemporary popular theater rather than Buddhist iconography.This large-scale example of Chen Hongshou's early figure style is a rare complement to the small-scale figures in his early album paintings and woodblock prints. At this enlarged scale, Chen Hongshou's technique and idiosyncratic stylistic sources become readily apparent. His relaxed and fluid drapery lines do not follow the disciplined brush mannerisms of literati models but instead are derived from popular paintings and woodblock prints.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP317447.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41470

His sharply tilted characters of varying sizes, in which the curved and hooked strokes are emphasized, also reflect the influence of the middle Ming master Zhu Yunming (1461C1527).

Most noticeably, the emphatic flaring at the end of horizontal or diagonal strokes, which is typical of clerical script writings, is missing. Instead, the width of individual strokes is rather even throughout, the corners are often rounded, and straight lines sometimes turn into smooth curves―all stylistic characteristics of seal script―while the occasional modulation of individual strokes is a defining feature of standard script.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP146982.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72799
Poetic Couplet for Xiangru,Lin Yutang,Dated 1968,"In this pair of hanging scrolls, Lin Yutang transcribed a famous couplet from a poem by Yan Shu (991C1055), a high-ranking official and major poet of the Northern Song period (960C1127). It reads:No matter what, flowers die.As if they once knew me, swallows return.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)Written in Lin's typical informal manner, the calligraphy achieves an overall effect of easy grace with little regard to the articulation of individual strokes.Lin Yutang dedicated this work to his third daughter, Xiangru (Hsiang Ju). The third character in the second line of the poem, xiang, corresponds to the first character of his daughter's given name; Lin cleverly personalized his gift by replacing the matching third character of the first line in the original poem, nai, with the second character of her name, ru, thus embedding her name within the fabric of the couplet. Lin's ingenious tampering with a well-known text shows the playfulness in his personality and his affectionate thoughtfulness for family members.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP147003.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73160
Bamboo and Cicada,Zhao Shao'ang,dated 1966,"Zhao Shao'ang, a native of Guangzhou, was the most influential artist in the second generation of the so-called Lingnan School of Guangdong painters, who are known for Western-inspired realism in their work. Extensively exhibiting his art abroad, Zhao may have had a greater impact on the West than in China.In this daring composition, the bamboo is executed in a single, powerful brushstroke punctuated by pauses and subtle realignments that exemplify Zhao's signature ""one stroke"" method. His depiction of the cicada goes beyond traditional painting by capturing the varied textures of the insect's body and wings. Most importantly, while the cicada's profile is sharply defined, the details on the surface of its body are deliberately blurred. The result is an organic realism that best approximates the imperfect perception of objects by the human eye.The cicada was a favorite subject of Zhao Shao'ang. In his inscription, it is clear that he cherished its conventional associations with the Confucian virtues of loftiness and purity, inspired by the cicada's habit of perching high on trees and the false belief that it lived entirely on dew:As jade-green leaves wither in autumn,Cicadas begin their melancholy songs in the chill.Unwilling to chase worldly glory,They drink dew to preserve their purity.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-29421-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72803
Chirping Bird,Zhao Shao'ang,dated 1978,"Zhao Shao'ang has been praised by some critics as the best flower-and-bird painter of his time. This painting, which blends descriptive realism and impressionistic brushwork, exemplifies Zhao's firm grasp of both avian anatomy and the nature of human perception. The bird's joints and claws stand out distinctly, while the dashing brushstrokes and blurred colors of its plumage vividly recreate the sight of its fluttering motion. The bird's gaping mouth and well-defined tongue evoke an equally strong sensation of its shrill chirping. Zhao's representations of birds excel not only in their ""jewel-like sensuous glitter,"" as noted by the critic Pierre Rouve, but also in their animated postures. Here, he has captured the bird in a fleeting moment just after landing, when it stands low on its legs, wings aflutter, tail raised high. Dedicating the painting to Lin Yutang's daughter, Taiyi, Zhao added a poetic couplet:Fluttering about are many lovely birds.Singing melodiously, they enjoy this beautiful moment.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP146988.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72804
Couplet Composed from Jiang Kui's Verses,Yang Tianji,dated 1917,"This work is a collaboration of two friends. Yang Tianji, an accomplished calligrapher and seal-carver from Jiangsu province, transcribes a couplet that another versatile artist Chen Hengke (1876C1923) composed by assembling phrases from several ci poems of the Southern Song (1127C1279) poet Jiang Kui (1155?C?1221).The couplet reads:Banana leaves, window gauze,It is true that a night's intimacy leads toten years of melancholy dreams.Rainbow bridge, paths by water,Don't forget the time when, in the misty rain on the lake,the pair of oars rippled the duckweeds.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)This practice of combining poetic phrases or lines from different sources into a new composition was popular among early-twentieth-century traditional poets and artists. Yang Tianji began studying calligraphy in childhood. By his prime he had familiarized himself with the styles of all the major masters and ancient script types. This piece exemplifies his standard script, for which he is best known. The angular corners and barely modulated lines of certain characters also reflect his command of clerical and seal scripts.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-29531-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72772

Qu Yuan and the Fisherman,Shen Hao,mid-17th century,"This fan depicts an encounter between the exiled minister Qu Yuan―purported author of the Nine Songs―and a wise fisherman. Dejected at his banishment from the capital, Qu complains to the fisherman of a world gone mad. The fisherman replies that Qu should take the world as it comes and adapt to changing circumstances.

Cloudy Mountains,Mi Youren,before 1200,"The son of Mi Fu (1052C1107), Mi Youren was an accomplished scholar-artist and the leading connoisseur of his time, often acting as the authenticator of ancient paintings for the emperor. He rose to the position of vice president of the Board of War. The simplified, blurry mountain forms, which Mi Youren inherited from his father (there is no longer any reliable example of the older Mi's painted work), represent a significant break from the detailed Northern Sung landscape styles. Created with wet ink dots (called ""Mi-family dots""), this style of landscape painting is the immediated predecessor of the evocative ink-wash landscape style of the later Southern Song period. Referred to by scholar-artists as ""ink play,"" the style suggests the importance of the painter's psychological expression, thereby raising the status of painting to that of poetry and calligraphy.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP212993_4_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40007
Wrist rest decorated with long beans,Jin Xiya,1935,"This wrist rest is an excellent example of bamboo carving by Jin Xiya (1890C1979), the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. It showcases Jin’s virtuosic command of traditional bamboo carving as well as his creative experimentation. His works incorporate compositions from designs contributed by important modern artists, such as Jin Cheng (1878C1926) on this piece. Jin’s works not only represent the highest achievement of bamboo carving in early twentieth century China, but they also preserve a microcosm of the literati world of that time, when members of the scholarly elite sought to sustain inherited traditions in the face of a rapidly modernizing world.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (wrist rest #42), the bamboo carving was completed on November 23, 1935.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-20433-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/839223
Riverscape with moored boats,Wu Shantao,late 17th or early 18th century,"The obscure painter Wu Shantao lived in the waning years of the Ming dynasty and through the transition to Qing rule. During this period, images of reclusion became particularly poignant, as people experienced the wrenching pain of dynastic collapse and reconstruction. Moored by the water’s edge, unseen except by passing birds, these fishing boats represented release from worldly troubles.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153885.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36002
Spring Offerings,Wu Changshuo,dated 1919,"Wu Changshuo adopted the ""antiquarian epigrapher's taste"" pioneered by Zhao Zhiqian (1829C1884): a deliberately naive, slightly awkward manner derived from the engravings on archaic stone monuments. Wu's favorite subjects were bold colorful images of flowers and rocks that found a ready market among Shanghai's new urban class. Spring Offerings presents popular emblems of long life and renewal appropriate for a New Year's greeting: lingzhi mushroom, narcissus, a garden rock, and the bright red berries of the nandina plant. It is not an image from nature, however, but an abstract arrangement that emphasizes epigraphic elements―round centered-tip brushwork, contrasts of form and blank space―in a simplified composition dominated by strong diagonal cross-movements.Wu's boldly brushed poem reads:The narcissus is long-lived and the lingzhi mushroom never fades,At year's end their appearance consoles my loneliness.The gnarled rock, set down by Heaven,Is like the Kunlunnu tribesman who waits upon the [singing girl clad in] red silk.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36426-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44567
Landscape in the Style of Juran and Yan Wengui,Wang Hui,Dated 1713,"At the age of eighty, Wang Hui continued to find inspiration for his paintings in the styles of the ancients. On an album leaf in the National Palace Museum, Taipei, dated 1713, he wrote that his sixty years of studying and emulating old masters had passed like a single day. In autumn of the same year, he painted this handscroll, which combines the disparate styles of Juran (act. ca. 960C95), evoked with long, soft brush lines that give texture and contour to the hillsides, and of Yan Wengui (act. ca. 970C1030), suggested by finely textured surfaces executed in crisp short strokes and dots. The inscription describes Wang Hui's inspiration:Some years ago I was a guest in the capital, where, at the home of a collector, I was able to see a great many scrolls by ancient men. Among them were two paintings: Juran's River Pass on a Clear Morning and Yan Wengui's Fishing near a Mountain Pass. Their divine color was magnificent and each was extremely refined and marvelous, among the best of all the famous works of the Song and Yuan. Suddenly, after more than twenty years, they have come to my breast. This scroll was made by combining the two masters' general concepts. Although in purity, truth, and subtle blandness it is not close to them, in its style it is not very far.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP204417_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49157
Landscapes,Dai Xi,1848,"Dai Xi was an accomplished poet, calligrapher, and painter as well as serving as Vice Minister of Military Affairs. In 1832 he was made a member of the Hanlin Academy, the prestigious body of scholars patronized by the imperial court.This elegant album was made for the poet Zhang Xianghe, who inscribed a long poem following Dai's paintings and colophon.

Gottwaldov,Fu Baoshi,dated 1957,"In the 1950s, images of fuming smokestacks, high-rise buildings, and broad highways were signs of progress. Fu’s depiction of Gottwaldov (present-day Zlìn, Czech Republic), celebrates these promises of socialist prosperity. Fu’s inscription reads, in part, “When entering the city, we saw tall buildings bathed in dim twilight and thick smoke.

Song of Sixteen Characters: Poem by Mao Zedong,Fu Baoshi,dated 1958,"The speed and motion of soldiers and horses, as well as the flames and smoke swirling into the sky, convey a powerful sense of the urgency of battle.

Poet Li Bai,Fu Baoshi,dated 1963,"Seated in a garden with blossoming plums, the poet Li Bai (701C762) gets drunk to set his soul free, and yet his gaze expresses deep emotion, as if seeing all life’s affairs unfolding. Painted two days before the artist’s sixtieth birthday, this is, according to the artist’s inscription, the most satisfactory of all of Fu’s portrayals of Li Bai.

Huichang: Poem by Mao Zedong,Fu Baoshi,dated 1958,"Mao Zedong’s poem alludes to the Red Army’s advance on Huichang, Jiangxi Province, where it established a southern revolutionary base in 1929.

Travelers in Snowy Mountains,Fu Baoshi,dated 1944,"Drawing on memory and imagination, Fu Baoshi painted this hauntingly beautiful snow scene in mid-autumn. Fu’s elongated composition, which emphasizes the height of the trees, and his flattening of the trees’ bare branches into abstract lacework has transformed this vision of snow-spattered hills and an icy river into a mysterious realm of arbitrary patterns.

Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum,Fu Baoshi,dated 1965,"The mausoleum of the founder of the Republic of China was a famous landmark in Nanjing, the city where Fu Baoshi lived during the final two decades of his life.

Changsha: Poetic Thoughts of Mao Zedong,Fu Baoshi,dated 1965,"Fu illustrated Mao Zedong’s 1925 poem “Changsha” in which Mao portrayed himself as a thoughtful scholar with noble aspirations, moral responsibilities, and deep feelings for the country. Fu followed the “red line” in such late political paintings, responding to the alarming attacks against other artists whose works were labeled as too “black,” “elitist,” and “highly toxic,” which foretold another policy change in the art world on the eve of the Cultural Revolution (1966C76).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/FBS.102.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76724

After Wang Meng’s “The Sounds of a Waterfall amid Autumn Valleys”,Fu Baoshi,dated 1933,"This dense, monumental landscape shows Fu experimenting with the composition and brush style of the Yuan dynasty artist Wang Meng (1301C1385).

Myriad Bamboo in Mist and Rain,Fu Baoshi,dated 1944,"This painting was inspired by a sudden rainstorm that Fu experienced while strolling on a mountain path.

The Elixir Terrace: Landscape after Shitao,Fu Baoshi,dated 1956,"The soaring peaks and overhanging cliff of this painting convey the scenic drama of Mount Huang (Yellow Mountain) in Anhui Province, where the legendary Yellow Emperor was said to have refined the elixir of immortality.

A Majestic View of the Mountainous City: Chongqing,Fu Baoshi,dated 1960,"To Fu, some of the happiest times in his life occurred during his wartime sojourn in Chongqing. Twenty years later, experiencing Chongqing with a new purpose, Fu focused on a densely populated city undergoing rapid social and economic change.

Waterfall at Heavenly Lake,Fu Baoshi,dated 1961,"This strikingly simple, abstract composition captures the awe-inspiring grandeur of Changbai Falls, which flows from Heavenly Lake atop Changbai Mountain in Jilin. Only the tiny figures at the base of the falls provide a sense of scale. Neither the source nor the outlet of the water is defined. Instead, Fu Baoshi confronts us with this monumental frontal image of water cascading between the dark flanks of a sheer cliff.

Meticulously Painting Our Rivers and Mountains,Fu Baoshi,datable to the early 1960s,"Depicted here is Mount Hua, China’s great Sacred Mountain of the West.

Guchengli,Fu Baoshi,dated 1961,"Both the painting’s diagonal composition and the streaks of blue wash used to depict the water help convey the swift flow of the river, where huge log rafts are each being guided by a single helmsman.

Recluse Fishing by Autumn Trees,Sheng Mao,dated 1350,"Sheng Mao's career as a successful professional painter frequently contrasted with that of his reclusive neighbor Wu Zhen (1280C1354). This painting is important because it shows that Sheng was aware of Wu's style and adopted it for his own use.

Scuttling Crab,Qi Baishi,dated 1919,"Qi Baishi emerged as an artist of distinctive genius late in life when he was able to integrate the study of calligraphy into his brushwork. This painting shows his tendency, even into his fifties, to rely on loose visual suggestion rather than on a calligraphic system of expressive brush lines. Each stroke that defines the crab's body and legs is painstakingly individualized to perform a specific descriptive function. Compare this representational mode of depiction with that of the adjacent Shrimp, done only eight years later, after Qi's images were enriched by his new calligraphic manner.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-25332-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49645
Dreaming of Flowers,Zhai Jichang,1807,"This painting tells the story of how the scholar Wang Guozhen came to have the nickname “Dreaming of Flowers” (Menghua, 艋). One day, Wang dozed off while at work in his garden. In a dream state, he walked into the garden, where he encountered an old man who lectured him on the illusory nature of sight, saying: “This riot of lushness around you . . . they are flowers, yet they are not, as flowers are only ever the illusion of flowers.” Light color and faint ink make the scene dreamlike, but they also reflect a renewed interest among nineteenth-century artists in Suzhou painters of the sixteenth century. This lightness of touch offered an antidote to the bold and heavy styles that had dominated the eighteenth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-L_2016_67_56_020.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/737791
Landscape,Huang Binhong,late 1940s,"By the end of the 1930s, after Huang Binhong had experimented with landscape, he returned to the study of earlier idioms but with a freer approach to brushwork that approached abstraction.This album leaf recalls the works of such Ming loyalists as Bada Shanren (1626C1705) and Kuncan (1612C1673). Red has been used to highlight the bridges, houses, and trees, but the effect emphasizes the linear patterns of these elements rather than their forms. Instead of signing this work, Huang impressed it with a seal that he placed in the sky above the landscape, as if it were the sun.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36430-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36438

Fish and rocks,Bada Shanren (Zhu Da),dated 1699,"To disguise his identity, Zhu Da, a scion of the Ming imperial family, took refuge in a Buddhist temple after the Manchu conquest of 1644. About 1680 he renounced his status as a monk and began producing paintings and calligraphy in order to support himself. In 1684 he took the biehao (artistic name) Bada Shanren (Mountain Man of the Eight Greats). A staunch Ming loyalist throughout his life, Bada used painting as a means of protest. His is the poignant voice of the yimin, the leftover subjects of the fallen dynasty.This painting is typical of the bold enigmatic images that Zhu Da produced during the last twenty years of his life. The seemingly innocuous subject, a garden pond framed by two ornamental rocks, becomes, in Zhu Da's rendition, profoundly unsettling. Were it not for seven tiny fish that swim beneath the two rock forms, transforming the blank paper into a body of water, the image would be unrecognizable. Six of the fish are shown in profile, but the seventh appears as if seen from above, leaving the viewer disoriented; the absence of a horizon line adds to the unsettling effect. Treating the image as a calligraphic design, Bada juxtaposes large and small, solid and void, and heavy and light, creating a tension between flat shapes and three-dimensional volumes that heightens the disturbing quality.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-19461-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41491
Letter,Wang Ao,late 15th or early 16th century,"Wang Ao was a gifted scholar from Suzhou who rose to become a Grand Secretary, one of the most prominent posts in the imperial bureaucracy. The text of this letter is decorous but light on content; mostly it is taken up with expressions of gratitude for previous letters and apologies for missing a chance to meet in person. Although the letter is perfunctory, the luxurious hydrangea-print stationery and the sinuous brushwork from a famous hand made this an object worth treasuring.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153898.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45748

Thirty-six Peaks of Mount Huang Recollected,Shitao (Zhu Ruoji),ca. 1705,"Among the wide range of styles developed by Shitao is this splattered ink technique, which the artist once described as “ten thousand ugly ink dots.” In this monumental work, Shitao re-created the scenery of Yellow Mountain from memory with bold brushstrokes “written” in the robust calligraphic style of Yan Zhenqing (709C785).For Shitao, the ultimate mountain scenery was represented by the incomparable peaks of Mount Huang, the Yellow Mountain in Anhui Province. Here, the artist recalls himself as the tireless traveler searching for exciting scenery; the seal following his signature reads: “I search out all the strange peaks to make designs [for my paintings].”",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36801-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49181
Spring Mountain after Rain,Qi Baishi,dated 1929,"By the late 1920's, Qi, well into his sixties had acquired a reputation in Peking, well-connected friends and financial ease from the sales of his paintings. As he reports in his diary: ""When I am cold I have coals to burn"". Qi Baishi took a post as a professor of art at Peking University. In 1928, he also published a volume of his poetry and four volumes of seal carvings.Spring Mountain after Rain belongs to this period of Qi's increasing confidence in his work. His bold adaptation of the ink-dot style associated with Mi Fu (1051C1107) attests to his creative assurance. He transforms the brush dabs into strong inky imprints and adds a daringly bright color to the traditional ink monochrome style.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-25335-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49649
The Qutang Gorge,Fu Baoshi,dated 1944,"The Qutang Gorge, located along the upper reaches of the Yangzi River in western China, has long been celebrated in literature and art for its grandeur and danger. Living in nearby Chongqing during the Sino-Japanese War, Fu Baoshi repeatedly painted its spectacular scenery. His diagonal composition intensifies the sense of the river’s momentum while his juxtaposition of wispy sails against the implacable cliffs suggests the ephemerality of human existence.In this painting, Fu transcribed a poem by the Sichuan poet Lü Qian (1621C1706) on the theme of homesickness. It resonates with his own sorrow over his forced dislocation from Nanjing, situated on the lower Yangzi River to the east:A few sails float on the river beyond the pavilion.Standing so long against the west wind, my temples turn gray.Only my homesick heart does not flow eastward downstream,Since it long ago followed the misty moon up the Qutang Gorge.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/SL_8_2012_3_4_Strm1_09.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77003
Travelers among Streams and Mountains,Wu Li,probably 1670s,"Wu Li, one of the six great Orthodox School masters of the early Qing, began his study of ancient paintings with an album owned by the venerable Orthodox painter Wang Shimin (1592C1680). The album, entitled Within Small See Large (Xiaozhong xianda), contained reduced copies of Song and Yuan masterpieces owned by Wang.In Travelers among Streams and Mountains, probably made in the 1670s, Wu Li carefully copies the album leaf that preserves a composition by the late Yuan master Wang Meng (ca. 1308C1385). Wu’s interpretation gives the work new life, however, through the vigor and spontaneity of his execution. Responding and adjusting to each newly realized brushstroke in a constant interaction between brush, ink, paper, and the observed form, Wu Li’s brushwork and composition grow with the “momentum” and “force” (shi) of the artist’s performance.In addition to superb brushwork, Wu Li demonstrates a genius for using ink; using different shades of gray, he creates in his landscape the luminous atmospheric quality that is one of his hallmarks.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP154151.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41485

Ink bamboo,Tang Yin,early 16th century,"A branch of bamboo stretches across this handscroll, its dangling leaves framing a poem inscribed by the artist.

Birds in a lotus pond,Bada Shanren (Zhu Da),ca. 1690,"Focusing on a narrow band of the natural world, Birds in a Lotus Pond, datable stylistically to about 1690, shows the artist boldly experimenting with the highly absorbent medium of satin to create a daring composition of saturated ink lines and dots starkly set against a blank background. The scroll opens with the daringly abstract form of a torn lotus leaf that is precariously suspended from its bent stalk, which extends leftward above a cluster of half-hidden blossoms. The black leaf stands in contrast to a stark white boulder, defined only by its ink outline. Two fluffy chicks perch atop this boulder, apparently oblivious to their surroundings. On the shore beyond crouch two mynahs, their glances directed upward toward a final lotus leaf that looms above them. Balanced on the back of the second mynah is another tiny chick, its beak open in song or hunger.The birds appear to personify the interaction of dark and light that animates the entire composition; the human-like expressions with which Bada has imbued them adds an unsettling quality to the already enigmatic composition.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP205836_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49143

Pavilion amongst Wintry Trees after Ni Zan,Qi Zhijia,dated 1661,"Qi Zhijia, whom a contemporary described as being ""addicted to calligraphy, painting, kickball, cymbal music, and opera,"" was a native of Shanyin, Zhejiang Province. He served briefly as an official under the Ming dynasty, but retired after the Manchu conquest of 1644, adopting the lifestyle of a scholar-recluse. Renown as a poet and calligrapher, he also excelled in landscape painting in the styles of the tenthcentury masters Dong Yuan and Juran.In this painting Qi has adopted the spare landscape idiom of the scholar-artist Ni Zan (1306C1374). Typified by an isolated grove of trees or empty pavilion set within an austere river landscape, Ni's images have long been understood as emblematic of the displacement and isolation experienced by many members of the educated elite during the disintegration of the Mongol Yuan dynasty. After the fall of the Ming, many loyalists consciously evoked Ni's pictorial imagery as a way of expressing their response to dynastic collapse.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/2000_665_1.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/59025

Outing to Zhang Gong's Grotto,Shitao (Zhu Ruoji),ca. 1700,"Zhang Gong's grotto, a famous scenic spot and once the abode of Zhang Daoling (Zhang Gong; 2nd century A.D.), a patriarch of the Daoist church, is located near Lake Tai in Jiangsu Province, not far from the pottery center of Yixing. According to Daoist beliefs, such grottoes are wellsprings of nature's creative force and offer the potential for rejuvenation and renewal.Shitao's painting of the grotto, done at the peak of his artistic powers, about 1700, is one of his most sumptuous masterpieces. Following an earlier composition by Shen Zhou (1427C1509), Shitao painted as if he were reenacting the cosmic process of creation: by building up layers of energized brushwork in flowery hues of sky blue, pale green, orange, and fuchsia, he transformed Shen Zhou's topographical likeness into a glowing image redolent of nature's procreative power. In a long poem at the end of the scroll, Shitao acknowledges the mystical Daoist attributes of the cave and playfully suggests that through his art he has captured both the cave and its creative force.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP204906_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49177
Mist and Rain in Helin,Pan Simu,1841,"The soft, wet washes in this landscape signal the brushwork lineage of Mi Fu, a famous calligrapher, painter, and connoisseur of the Northern Song dynasty (960C1127).

Tao Yuanming,Fu Baoshi,1957,"In wartime China during the 1940s, Fu Baoshi often turned to ancient subjects to express his grief, anger, and bewilderment at the troubled world around him. He continued to paint such themes, especially depictions of poets and famous poems, after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, though the new context gave them additional layers of meaning.

Drunken recluse beneath an old tree,Chen Zihe,early 16th century,"By the end of the fifteenth century the court had ceased to be the principal patron of the arts, so professional painters turned to private sponsors and to the marketplace as outlets for their work, adopting a bravura style of execution that transformed painting into a kind of performance art. Using an idiom of bold monochrome brushwork and graded ink washes first employed by Chan (Zen) Buddhist monk-artists during the thirteenth century, these artists made compositions with dazzling virtuosity, often before astonished onlookers.The Fukinese painter Chen Zihe was a significant regional master in this tradition who took the sobriquet ""Uninhibited Immortal"" to emphasize his rejection of convention. Chen's humorous and somewhat provocative image of a drunken immortal exhibits all the key conventions of his craft. The shallow picture space and tight composition are constructed of powerful diagonals that intensify the dramatic focus, while highly animated brushwork offers a lively counterpoint to the massive scale of the pictorial elements, many of which are truncated by the frame.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-19329-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39553

The poem’s imagery alludes to the conflict between China and the Soviet Union that began in 1960.

Autumn Colors among Streams and Mountains,Shen Zhou,ca. 1490C1500,"In this long handscroll, Shen Zhou explored four Yuan painters' brush idioms-those of Ni Zan (1306C1374), Huang Gongwang (1269C1354), Wang Meng (ca. 1308C1385), and Wu Zhen (1280C1354). Beginning with the familiar Ni Zan image of sparse trees, barren rocks, and an empty pavilion, Shen Zhou developed Ni's angular ""folded-belt"" texture strokes into a longer texture pattern that signaled the style of Huang Gongwang and an expansive change of mood. Then, with his brush tip turned inward to form round, dense, curling, and stippled texture strokes, Shen created rock forms that contained the controlled energy of those by Wang Meng. Finally, using simple round brushstrokes to represent rolling shores and blunt and stocky trees, he evoked the serene and melancholy mood of Wu Zhen.By practicing the different brush idioms of the Yuan masters, Shen was able to treat the theme of autumn mountains with a wide range of expressive moods and interpretations.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP236590_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45683
Mountain Spirit,Fu Baoshi,datable to 1945,"The heroine of “Mountain Spirit,” an ancient ode from the shamanistic Nine Songs, a literary cycle attributed to Qu Yuan (343C278 B.C.), was a major inspiration for Fu Baoshi’s figure painting. The subject, plausibly identified as a goddess associated with poetic eroticism, manifests herself as “theclouds of morning and the rain of evening”; hence Fu always portrayed her moving through a turbulent mist-filled sky. Although the text describes her wearing “a coat of fig leaves with a rabbit-floss girdle,” Fu depicts her in a white flowing robe with long fluttering sashes in the manner of Gu Kaizhi (ca. 345C406).

In his inscription, Fu writes:Red Cliff Village, located near the Hualong Bridge in Chongqing, was the headquarters of a bureau of the Communist Party’s Central Committee during the Sino-Japanese War. Some of the leading figures of the reactionary [Nationalist] Party lived in the vicinity. The marker under the banyan tree pointed the way. To the right was headquarters; to the left, enemy [Nationalist] territory. Imagine the intensity of the conflicts. Thus the masses call it yinyang tree. I had passed by this spot once or twice in the past, but only recorded it now, after 14 years.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/FBS.062.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76696
Snow: Poetic Thoughts of Mao Zedong,Fu Baoshi,dated 1959,"Here, Fu rendered a panorama of a snowy landscape in an impressionistic manner. Mountains and rivers are conveyed with swift, scribbling strokes over blank areas of shimmering white―all full of vital energy. Mao Zedong stands on a mountaintop, taking in the vista, as a soldier behind him carries a revolutionary flag―a modern, radical twist on the old pictorial convention of a recluse seeking solace in nature with an attendant who follows him carrying a qin, or zither. This fantastic snowy scene anticipates the famous work Such Is the Beauty of Our Rivers and Mountains, which is based on the same poem.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/FBS.051.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76685
Landscape,Fu Baoshi,dated 1943,"Painting materials were not easy to acquire during the war, but kindred souls still shared them. Fu’s inscription tells us that he painted this landscape after receiving a gift of old ink cakes from a friend. The painting was also done to remember another deceased friend who had offered him ink. Fu adds, “These ink cakes may not have been considered marvelous in the past; today, when given, they are as precious as one hundred friends.” Here, the portrayal of light and atmosphere through a consummate control of richly graduated ink washes is indebted to the Japanese artist Takeuchi Seiho (1864C1942).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/FBS.019.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76654
The Three Laughers at Tiger Creek,Fu Baoshi,dated 1945,"The Buddhist monk Huiyuan (334C416) led a reclusive life and forbade himself from going beyond Tiger Creek. One day he was visited by the Confucian poet Tao Qian (365C417) and the Daoist Lu Xiujing (406C477), and the three men became deeply absorbed in conversation. When Huiyuan strolled with his guests to say farewell, he did not realize he had walked over the creek, causing his tiger to raise a roar of alarm―hence, the spontaneous laughter of the three men. The story is often treated delightfully in painting, with special emphasis on the moment of laughter and awakening, as seen here.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/FBS.028.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76663
Evening Rain in the Ba Mountains,Fu Baoshi,dated 1944,"The artistic conception of this work can be inferred from Fu’s inscription on another version on the same theme, in which he writes, “I have been in Shu [Sichuan] for almost five years, residing on the lower slope of Jin’gangpo. . . . For nearly twenty days there has been persistent rain. The drops pattering on the low houses have stirred the feelings of this sojourner. Last night [my wife] Shihui and I talked about our moves since the outbreak of war.

Mountain Spirit,Fu Baoshi,dated 1946,"This painting was inspired by a shamanistic song from the ancient literary work Nine Songs, attributed to Qu Yuan (343C278 B.C.). It describes a mountain spirit “driving tawny leopards and striped lynxes” who takes a perilous path to meet a lover but is late for the tryst. The poem describes the scene:The thunder rumbles; rain darkens the sky:The monkeys chatter; apes scream in the night:The wind murmurs sadly and the trees rustle.I think of my lady and stand alone in sadness.―Trans. Joseph Minford and Joseph S. M. LauFu inscribed the full text of the song along the right side of the painting.

Mount Yuntai,Fu Baoshi,dated 1941,"Fu Baoshi’s interest in art history is demonstrated by this work, a pictorial reconstruction of an ancient text by Gu Kaizhi (ca. 345C406) titled “Essay on Painting Yuntai Mountain.” The essay―inscribed in full on the painting―is a literary description of how a painter should create a landscape by incorporating various scenes. In conducting his own research on the text, Fu challenged existing Japanese interpretations. His efforts to construct an indigenous art history were also motivated by patriotic feelings aroused in response to China’s war with Japan.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/FBS.014.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76649
Drunken Monk,Fu Baoshi,dated 1944,"The Tang Buddhist monk and calligrapher Huaisu (725Cca. 799), who often drank heavily to eliminate inhibitions before practicing calligraphy, composed the following poem in response to a painting of a drunken calligrapher-monk:Everybody delivers wine,It remains untouched.All day amid the pines hangs a bottle.The Cursive Script Sage goes mad as an inspiration comes.All is captured in the “Drunken Monk.”―Trans. Anita ChungFu Baoshi, who also sought uninhibited artistic liberation through wine, must have found this theme particularly appealing.

Riding a Donkey Beneath Bamboo,Fu Baoshi,datable to 1925,"This hanging scroll belongs to a set of four that represents Fu Baoshi’s earliest surviving work. Created for a private patron, each scroll bears a long inscription that identifies Fu’s source of inspiration―in this case, Mi Fu (1051C1107)―and reveals his art-historical approach to painting and fondness for the literati tradition. It reads:Gao Kegong [1248C1310] was the most remarkable among those following the style of Mi Fu. Dong Qichang [1555C1636], who grew up in Yunjian [present-day Shanghai], once remarked, “Later artists modeling after Mi Fu could only pile up the ink dots without imparting openness and closeness [as contrast].

After Mao Zedong’s “Saying Goodbye to the God of Disease (I)”,Fu Baoshi,dated 1958,"This painting was inspired by the first of two poems by Mao on eradicating disease:And if the cowherd who lives on a starAsks about the god of plagues,Tell him, happy or sad, the god is gone,Washed away in the waters.In Fu’s illustration, a desolate scene of calamity is relieved by the appearance of the mythical herdboy announcing the arrival of better times.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/FBS.047.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76682
Shaoshan,Fu Baoshi,dated 1959,"In June 1959, at the invitation of the Hunan People’s Publishing House, Fu spent nine days in Shaoshan to highlight two major sites: Mao Zedong’s former residence and Shaoshan Mountain. The scroll opens on the right with a depiction of the magnificent emerald-green mountain rising above a valley dotted with the modern structures brought to the village under socialist reconstruction: a school, guesthouse, post office, cultural center, and the people’s commune.

Walking with a Staff and Carrying a Zither,Fu Baoshi,datable to 1925,"Fu Baoshi’s inscription reads:Ni Zan [1306C1374] said, “What I call painting does not exceed the joy of careless sketching with the brush. I do not seek formal likeness but do it simply for my own amusement.” To evaluate painting, there were different categories of greatness: divine [shen], wonderful [miao], competent [neng], and effortless [yi]. Wasn’t the [eighth-century] critic Zhu Jingxuan perceptive in this regard? Painted during the yichou year [1925] for the advice of Mr. Zhenqing. Master of the Studio for Embracing Stones.―Trans.

The Poet Qu Yuan,Fu Baoshi,dated 1942,"The poet-statesman Qu Yuan (343C278 B.C.) drowned himself to prove his moral purity and loyalty in the face of slander. Fu created this compelling image in response to a modern play about Qu Yuan by the historian, poet, and playwright Guo Moruo (1892C1978). Guo revived this historical theme to express both patriotic sentiments and criticism of China’s wartime politics. Capturing the psychological suffering of the poet before his suicide, Fu’s image expresses the grievances and pathos of intellectuals in the face of war and political corruption. The similarity of this composition with a work by Yokoyama Taikan (1868C1958) reveals Fu’s study of contemporary nihonga (Japanese-style paintings).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/FBS.023.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76658
Teapot in the Shape of a Plum Blossom,Shi Dabin,early 17th century,The invention of the teapot is often credited to potters working in the Yixing district of Jiangsu Province sometime in the sixteenth century.

Playing the Qin and Watching Geese in Flight,Fu Baoshi,dated 1948,"Fu Baoshi's growing sense of isolation as the political situation worsened in 1948 is apparent in this painting, which he did in Nanjing in March of that year. The depiction of a scholar strumming a zither at the edge of a desolate flood plain crisscrossed with waterways was inspired by the story of Boya, a legendary zither player whose teacher brought him to the island of the immortals in order to teach him how to play expressively. In Fu's interpretation, the figure of Boya is silhouetted against a marshy expanse, while his servant, huddled against an embankment, appears oblivious to his master's playing. A delicate formation of descending geese, suspended in the moist atmosphere, evokes the fleeting tones of Boya's music. The figure's erect posture may signal Fu's resolve to continue working, even in the face of an uncertain future.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-31958-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49671
A Glimpse of the Coal Capital,Fu Baoshi,dated 1961,"Recalling his visit to the coal capital Fushun, in Liaoning Province, and the motivation for this painting, Fu wrote:I still remember vividly what the Party Secretary told me about . . . the coal mine. . . . Suddenly he pointed to the coal layers in the walls of the mine and said, “Look, how beautiful the color is!” I was terrified. . . . Everybody knows that coal is dark black. A mine operated by several hundred thousand miners was filled with coal mine dust, and yet, in the eye of our Party Secretary, it was so beautiful.

Goddess of the River Xiang,Fu Baoshi,dated 1947,"The youthful Fu Baoshi, fiercely idealistic and proud, often created images of unrecognized virtue, a theme that found its earliest expression in the poetry of Qu Yuan (343-278 B.C.), a loyal minister of the Chu kingdom who drowned himself in a tributary of the Xiang River in response to the false slander of his enemies.Here, Fu was inspired by verses from a cycle of poems entitled the Nine Songs that is traditionally attributed to Qu Yuan. The Xiang River, a major tributary of the Yangzi that ran through the state of Chu, was known to harbor a goddess in its depths. She surfaced and enchanted the poet, who swore to make her his bride. The moment of enchantment depicted by Fu is described by the poet::The Child of God, descending the northern bank,Turns on me her eyes that are dark with longing.Gently the wind of autumn whispers;On the waves of Dongting Lake the leaves are falling.(David Hawkes, trans., Ch'u Tz'u: The Songs of the South [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1959], p. 38)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP162670.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49670
Summer retreat in the eastern grove,Wen Zhengming,calligraphy datable to 1512,"This poem, written in the running-script style of Huang Tingjian (1045C1105), is one of two poems by Wen appended to this painting. Both texts reveal Wen Zhengming's early study of the Northern Song master's large-scale calligraphy. Wen Zhengming devoted his life to the revival and creative reinterpretation of the expressive traditions of Song and Yuan painting and calligraphy. Wen particularly admired the writing style of Huang Tingjian, a passion he acquired from his mentor Shen Zhou (1427C1509). Wen's bold calligraphy stands in marked contrast to the officially sanctioned standard-script style practiced by court bureaucrats and reflects his independent nature.A final colophon by Wen explains the circumstances surrounding the poems' creation. Wen wrote the poems in 1512 for his friend Qian Tongai (1475C1549). The poems were subsequently acquired by Nanzhou, abbot of the Tianwang Temple. When Wen visited Nanzhou in 1515 he saw his poems and appended his colophon.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP205369_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45776

Two Goats,Wang Zhen,dated 1914,"Wang Zhen's artistic training began under his father, who had a passion for painting. In 1882 Wang began to study formally; he was noticed by Ren Yi (1840C1895) and became his disciple. About 1914, shortly after Wu Changshi (1844C1927) arrived in Shanghai, Wang became his student. In spite of his travels to Japan and his exposure to Western culture, Wang did not adopt a Western-influenced style. He learned to master figural motifs and painterly effects from Ren Yi; from Wu Changshi he learned to practice a powerful calligraphic manner of brushwork.Two Goats recalls Ren Yi's Three Goats painted in 1878. Using Wu Changshi's round brushwork, Wang transformed Ren's more realistic representation into calligraphic pattern.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-30469-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49629
Orchids,Ma Lin,second quarter of the 13th century,"This exquisite representation of an orchid, signed by Ma Lin, son of Ma Yuan (act. ca. 1190-1225), exemplifies the style of formal realism favored by the aristocratic Southern Song court. The simple asymmetrical balance of flowers and leaves, meticulously rendered in subtle shades of lavender, white, and malachite green, bespeaks a consciously aestheticizing sensibility. Such flower paintings recall late Southern Song lyric poems about flowers.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP154082.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40133
Water Buffalo Under a Willow Tree,Qi Baishi,late 1930s,"Qi's ability to reduce his depiction to a minimum and still convey meaning with a sense of humor is epitomized in this depiction of a water buffalo seen from the rear, its hindquarters forming a perfect circle from which tail, legs, horn, and muzzle and the dark line of a rope protrude. The ink used to describe the rump is mixed with water to create the appearance of fur. A broken horizon line bisects the beast, which would otherwise appear to be hovering like an inflated balloon. The attenuated form of a willow tree, its long stringy wisps seeming to flutter lightly in the breeze, contrasts with the sturdy immobility of the buffalo.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/1986_267_223.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36272
Quatrain on spring’s radiance,Empress Yang Meizi,early 13th century,"During the Southern Song, artists and connoisseurs who wished to express their emotional responses to paintings frequently added poems to them. Empress Yang's poems appear on a number of paintings by such court artists as Ma Yuan (active ca. 1190C1225) and Ma Lin (active ca. 1180Cafter 1256); this quatrain must once have complemented a fan painting of flowers, but it reveals more about the state of mind of the empress than about the lost painting it accompanied:My makeup worn and faded, only the scent lingers;Still I shall enjoy spring's beauty before my eyes.Once you said to me, how a year blooms quicklyand as quickly dies!Might we now forsake worldly splendors for theland of wine?",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153484.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40103

Garden of the Inept Administrator,Wen Zhengming,1551,"The Garden of the Inept Administrator (Zhuozheng Yuan) was built on the site of an ancient temple in Suzhou by the censor Wang Xianchen (act. ca. 1500C1535). In 1527, after an unhappy stay in Beijing, the artist Wen Zhengming returned to Suzhou, where he was given a studio in the garden. In an album of 1535, Wen painted thirty-one views of the site, each accompanied by a poem and a descriptive note. Sixteen years later, at the age of eighty-one, he painted this second album of eight views. The garden still exists in Suzhou, but centuries of renovations make it difficult to identify Wen's scenes.In these works Wen achieved the ideal integration of the three separate arts of poetry, calligraphy, and painting (the so-called three perfections). With characteristic restraint, he chose to use only ink, but, aided by the poems, the quiet and exquisite images easily evoke that magical, autumnal moment in the garden.The Bank of Many FragrancesVarious kinds of flowers are planted next to thethatched hall,Purple luxuriance and red beauty in random array;The spring radiance and brilliance embroiders themwith a thousand artifices,In the good air and scented mist a hundredfragrances mix.I love the smells that fill my bosom and sleeves,I do not let the wind and dew wet my clothes,My thoughts fly high beyond the flowery world.Quietly, I watch the bees dance up and down.The Bamboo BankBamboos are planted around the low moundForming a bank of bamboo around the edge.In full summer it already seems to be autumn,So deep is the wood, one cannot tell when it is noon.In its midst is one who has abandoned the world,Enjoying himself with a lute and a goblet.When a wind stirs, he too wakes from drunkennessTo sit and listen to the rain on the bamboo leaves.The Canglang PavilionOnce a small pavilion was built by Canglang pond,*The green water still surrounds its empty railings;Here there are always wind and moon to offer tothe fisherman,And boys, too, singing “Wash your cap strings!”Rivers and lakes fill the whole land, enough formy enjoyment,For a hundred years the fish and birds haveforgotten themselves;Shunjing [Su Zimei, 1008C1048] is dead,Du Ling [Du Fu, 712C770] far away―As a paragon of hermits who will compete with me?*Confucius was said to have admired a song sungby a small boy:“When Canglang’s waters are clear, I wash mycap strings;When Canglang’s waters are muddy, I washmy feet.”Clear and muddy waters refer to good and badpolitical and social circumstances.The Banana BalustradeThe new banana is more than ten feet tall;After the rain it is clean as though washed.It does not dislike the high white wall,It elegantly matches the curved red balustrade.Cool autumn sounds come to my pillow,Green morning colors are seen through thewindows.Let no one take to the shears heedlessly,Leave it until its shade reaches my house.The Fishing StoneThe white stone is clean and dustless;Flat, it overhangs the stream of wild water.I sit and watch the line rolling,I take quiet pleasure in the jadelike turning[of the water].I enjoy rivers and lakes, far off,I forget cares, and gulls and egrets becometame friends.You must know that he who stretches his line,Is not one who desires [to catch] fish.The Apple GardenHere in summer a cool shade spreads over ten mu[of land]This is when the fruits begin to ripen in the longorchard;At the place where the precious baskets are dividedand given away,In a small window, I have got a rubbing of Youjun’s[Wang Xizhi’s] calligraphy.The Locust Tree PavilionBelow the pavilion a tall locust tree falls overthe wall,Mist on the cold leaves wets my clothes.The scattered flowers are sparse but their scenttravels far,The cool shade falls all around, of lasting benefitto the world.During the literary examinations of the eighthmoon, past achievements are recalled,When the honors of the three ministers areentrusted to the candidates.Since I became old I have not indulged in suchdreams,Alone I move my bed to lie in the cool of evening.The Jade SpringOnce I ladled water from the Fragrant HillsCool as a stream of jade*Would you know that as far as Yao [seventh starof the Big Dipper] is from the Milky WayThere is another clear jade spring?Preparing a rope, I draw water with the clouds,In an earthen jar, I boil it with moonlight.What need of Lu Hongjian [Lu Yu (d. 804), afamous tea master]?At the first sip you will yourself decide.*The Jade Spring is a famous water source located in the Fragrant Hills near Beijing.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP235628_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39654

"Rice Culture, or Sowing and Reaping",Unidentified artist,before 1353,"Rice Culture depicts China's most fundamental economic activity: the cultivation and harvesting of rice. It is based closely on a set of texts and illustrations first created by the Southern Song court painter Lou Shou (1090C1162). The scroll, which preserves the final nine scenes from this series, bears an inscription, dated 1353, by a Mongolian named Hugechi that states that, after he acquired this painting, he had it remounted and presented it to the Grand Preceptor as a resource for establishing policy.The work not only documents the continuation of the Song-style court painting tradition but demonstrates how Mongol officials, in spite of their nomadic heritage, had come to appreciate both the fundamental nature of agriculture in Chinese society and its importance in sustaining the fiscal health of the dynasty.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP120736.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72769
Wilderness Colors,Shitao (Zhu Ruoji),ca. 1700,"In the mid-1690s, after a life of wandering, Shitao settled permanently in Yangzhou, a bustling commercial city on the Grand Canal that eclipsed Suzhou during the eighteenth century as the most vigorous economic and cultural center in China. Renouncing his monastic vows and taking the name Dadizi, or ""Greatly Purified One,"" Shitao turned to painting as his sole means of support.In Wilderness Colors, each leaf offers something unexpected, not only in the painter's choice of subject and compositional arrangement but also in the subtle wit and touching personal insights revealed in the verbal and pictorial imagery. Many of the leaves were inspired by Du Fu (712C770) and Li Bo (701C762) of the Tang dynasty (618C907); others refer to personal experiences. In late-seventeenth-century criticism, an excess of technical versatility in painting was considered as bad as ""overcooked"" food. Shitao's lighthearted account of eating vegetables raw reveals his intention to maintain an uninhibited style all his own.Once Wang Anjie* presented me with a poem, saying: ""Get some spring water in your copper bowl and roast some taro on the earthen stove."" He truly understood me. But what a laughable, uncouth person I am! This year I greedily obtained some huge taro roots. They were too large to be roasted in a short time, so I ate them all partly raw.

Ink Tablet Decorated with Five Pines,Cheng Junfang,late 19thCearly 20th century,"High-quality ink cakes produced by Cheng Junfangand Fang Yulu are often decorated with designs that have literary allusions. The motif of five pines on this ink cake is derived from the story of the first emperor's trop to Tai Mountain, where he was caught in a storm. He took shelter under an ancient pine tree, on which he later conferred the official title Wutafu. A later misunderstanding of this title gave rise to the motif of five pine trees. The black stag motif on the square ink cake.

Fisherman's Lodge At Mount Xisai,Li Jie,ca. 1170,"In this imaginary depiction of his retirement retreat the scholar-official Li Jie presents an image of his future home in a self-consciously primitive manner. The archaic, maplike image―composed of frontal, schematically rendered mountains and trees, an archaic ""blue-and-green"" color scheme, an uptilted ground plane, and sticklike architecture―directly recalls an early paradigm of the scholarly retreat: the Wangchuan Villa of the Tang poet-painter Wang Wei (699C759).Li Jie retired to Mount Xisai in 1184 after an illustrious official career but executed this work about 1170 in anticipation of his retirement, which did not occur until 1184. It was in 1170 that Li also began to solicit colophons to his painting from some of the leading figures of his day, including the statesman and poet Fan Chengda (1126C1193). The resulting combination of painting and poems forms a unique record of Southern Song scholarly collaboration in the creation of a pictorial and literary work that celebrates the ideal of retirement―a phenomenon that anticipates by nearly a century similar artistic collaborations among scholars living under the Mongol Yuan dynasty.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-15820-005_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40057

Landscapes and Flowers,Wang Shishen,dated 1745,"A native of Shexian, Anhui Province, Wang Shishen moved to Yangzhou by 1709 and made the acquaintance of Ma Yueguan (1687-1755), a salt merchant also of Anhui origin who was to become a leader of local scholarly and artistic circles. Their friend-patron relationship was important to Wang's career.Wang's painting is praised for its delicate touch and subtle lyricism, especially in his depictions of plum blossoms. Here they are rendered either alone or accompanied by other flowers. His terse, rhythmic brushwork contributes to the liveliness of all his floral images. Much rarer among Wang Shishen's extant works are landscapes. A major inspiration to him in this genre was Shitao (1642C1707), a celebrated master who lived in Yangzhou during the final decade of his life.

The poem is by Wang Wei (699C759), but the calligraphy itself is inspired by Mi Fu (1051C1107), whom Dong greatly admired. It is not a careful copy of Mi Fu’s style, but an attempt to capture its spirit. The asymmetrical balance of some characters, the extensive use of the split-brush effect known as “flying white” (feibai), and the large scale of the characters are all homages to Mi Fu that bring Dong to the edge of his comfort zone, as he pushes himself to be less controlled and careful.The Metropolitan Museum has one of the only surviving works of large-scale calligraphy by Mi Fu.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/YY0284_sec01_8874_edt.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/633303

Myriad Bamboo in Mist and Rain,Fu Baoshi,dated 1944,"In this evocative landscape of brimming streams and dense bamboo, the animated texturing of the distant mountains captures the impression of coarse-surfaced rocks seen through rain.

According to the artist’s inscription, this painting was executed in 1963 for his friend Ms. Li Deying (1913C2001) at his residence in S?o Paulo.

Paintings after Shitao's "Wilderness Colors",Zhang Daqian,ca. 1930,"Zhang Daqian was a great admirer and collector of the works of Shitao (1642C1707); he was also an accomplished forger of Shitao's paintings. These acknowledged copies provide an invaluable resource for connoisseurs of both artists' work. Zhang's paintings are undated, but the seals all bear legends that he used in the late 1920s and 1930s, when he was intensely interested in mastering Shitao's painting style.Zhang's interpretations are not slavish copies; rather, they are dashing sketches with their own energy and visual appeal. Nevertheless, Zhang's paintings are consistently simpler in execution, with fewer colors and less detail. A subtler difference is Zhang's tendency to transform Shitao's naturalistic, three-dimensional renderings into flat abstractions. A final telling difference between the two artists' work is the calligraphy. Each of Shitao's inscriptions draws inspiration from a different antique master; even within the same inscription, one can sense a variety of stylistic sources. Zhang's shorter inscriptions reflect his familiarity with Shitao's most characteristic writing style, but they lack the varied stylistic influences that distinguish Shitao's writing.(translations of calligraphic text on Zhang Daqien, Paintings after Shitao's ""Wilderness Colors"", about 1930, ink and color on paper)Taro RootsEating even one half [of a taro root is better than] receiving the post of prime minister for ten years.BambooThe wind has diminished after sweeping away the layered clouds;Alone with an open mind I enter the woods.While the phoenix remains hidden the tree bears few red fruits [i.e., the times are not propitious];But I won't let the struggling yellow disturb my contemplative state of mind.Painted by Qingxiang Laoren [Shitao]; copied by DaqianEggplantsYear after year as summer approaches I am proud of my new harvest,But I act like [Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) of] Wuxing in the Zhijun Studio.This purple color is not the same as that of leaves after frost,Holding the handle [of my hoe] I join my friends in the fields.Orchid and RockWhen one speaks of picking flowers to present;If not to a gentleman, then to whom?",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP164319.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/65060

Rather, this meticulously styled beauty with her large head, wraithlike form and delicate features is an unmistakable late 19th century romantic creature. Qian Huian’s influential style, promulgated by his many students and through his popular painting manual, led to the appearance of similar beauties on fans, calendars and painted snuff bottles, as well as in paintings.Qian Huian’sreferences to orthodox painters like Tang Yin and the literary inscriptions he frequently added to his paintings made them attractive to patrons aspiring to literati taste.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP162537.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49476

Eight views of the Yellow Mountains,Zheng Min,1681,"In the seventeenth century, painters from Anhui began to exploit the album’s special qualities to represent the Yellow Mountains (Huangshan), vista by vista, one leaf at a time. This example, by the relatively little-known artist Zheng Min, ranks among the best Huangshan albums; its compositional originality and subtle brushwork unfolds over a journey of eight distinct parts. Zheng Min combined the signature dry brush technique of the Anhui School’s founder Hongren with subtle ink washes to create a less austere, more descriptive style. Adding to the album’s appeal is the artist’s lengthy inscription, on the final leaf,which explains the story of the album’s creation.In this long inscription, written to accompany the album, Zheng Min explains the circumstances of its creation: [Summary]: In 1681, Zheng was approached by a younger friend named Chuzhen, who asked the master to paint two albums: one for him, and one for a friend. He obliged, painting this album for Chuzhen in the hopes of spurring his interest in Mount Huang, where the young man had never been. Zheng Min himself had been there only twice, the most recent trip more than seven years earlier. He painted this album from memory. In his inscription, he writes, “In the future, after all his children get married, if Chuzhen ever travels there, I hope he will take this album with him to check against the actual sites. I will then become his tour guide.”―Trans. by Shi-yee Liu",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP332570.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77870
Viewing plum blossoms by moonlight,Ma Yuan,early 13th century,"Crafted as carefully as the regulated verse of a Tang dynasty quatrain, Ma Yuan's Viewing Plum Blossoms by Moonlight is a visual poem evoking a complex sense of time, place, and mood. The browns and blacks in the trees and rocks contrast with the light grayish hues of the cliff and mountain to suggest the mist-filled, moonlit atmosphere of an early spring evening. The thatch roof of a pavilion identifies the place as a garden setting. The white-robed gentleman, framed by the dark angular forms of the landscape, perfectly counterbalances the moon in its setting of limitless space. Recalling a yin-yang cosmic diagram with its implication of positive within negative, light within dark, solid within void, the painting may be read as an emblem of man's dual nature: tied to the physical world, man's spirit is not contained by it but, like the plum, reaches upward to partake of the infinite.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP160432.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44638
Landscapes after old masters,Yun Xiang,datable to 1638 or 1650,"Hailed as ""the foremost painter after Shen Zhou [1427-1509]"" by the collector-critic Zhou Lianggong (1612-1672), Yun Xiang was an influential forerunner of such leading early Qing Nanjing painters as Gong Xian (1619-1689).Living in retirement after the Manchu conquest as an yimin, or ""leftover subject,"" of the Ming, Yun Xiang especially admired the dry-brush manner of Ni Zan (1306-1374), the archetypal reclusive scholar-painter of the late Yuan period. Three of the ten paintings in this virtuoso album, in which Yun Xiang interprets a wide range of earlier masters' styles through remarkable variations in brushwork and compositional motifs, were inspired by Ni Zan. The methods of interpretation, bearing the unmistakable influence of the late Ming theorist-painter Dong Qichang (1555-1636), were further developed by Gong Xian and other leading early Qing masters in the late seventeenth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP161053.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49017
Wandering in a Cloud-Filled Valley,Pu Ru,late 1940s or early 1950s,"Pu Ru, a Manchu prince who lived through the fall of the Qing dynasty, was a classical scholar, poet, calligrapher, and painter. Although he disliked being referred to as an artist, his fame today rests on his painting. Typically, Pu worked in the academic style of the Song dynasty (960C1279), which combined descriptive representation with atmospheric effects, but he often adapted and integrated the Song manner, as he did here, by incorporating later interpretations of that style by such Ming-dynasty artists as Tang Yin (1470C1523).The powerful pines depicted here may have had a very specific association for Pu Ru. After the Manchu dynasty was overthrown, he was forced to live at a Buddhist temple in the Western Hills near Beijing that was surrounded by them. He repeatedly recalled these pines in paintings and nostalgic writings later in his life. Pu inscribed this work with a quatrain:White clouds fill my hut by the cliff;The sound of a stream fills the empty valley.Whence came this person into the mountains?Forgetting the schemes of the world he befriends the deer.(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)He embellished his inscription with an oval seal that reads ""a piece of red cloud,"" which is impressed on portions of its first two characters, baiyun (white clouds).

Poems,Wen Zhengming,1545,"明 文彰 行自 卷 本The dean of the Suzhou cultural scene during the sixteenth century, Wen Zhengming was admired in equal measure for his painting and calligraphy. In calligraphy, his reserved personality found form in stable compositions and elegantly smooth brushwork that was accomplished but never showy. In this scroll, written in the prime of his career, he transcribed nearly twenty of his own poems in his celebrated semicursive script. While the subtly nuanced poems attest to his stature as a leader of the local literate elite, the calligraphy embodies the ideal union of virtuosity and grace.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP325224_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78855

Letter by Li Zhi,Bada Shanren (Zhu Da),dated 1702,"In 1693 Zhu Da began studying works from the Chunhuage tie, a collection of rubbings of early calligraphies compiled in 992. This fan transcribes on piece from that collection, a letter from Li Zhi, who later became the emperor Tang Gaozong (r. 650C83). Zhu Da's writing freely departs from Li Zhi's original: done with plump ""centered-tip"" brushstrokes, Zhu's characters possess a simple, unaffected archaic flavor that is unmistakably his own.Zhu Da's transcription of Li Zhi's letter reads: Uncle, you possess a great many artistic talents and you are an outstanding, compassionate teacher. Your son Ai has thus received an exemplary education and he is receptive and diligent, especially in calligraphy. When I heard that he had lately become particularly fond of the ""Flying white"" technique, I playfully took up my brush to amuse him. What I wrote is far from the graceful forms of the Six Calligraphic Modes and remiss in elegant diction. Yet, soon afterward I received your letter in which you so generously praised my work. In truth, the work is mere ""ink traces"" and does not deserve such attention.

The jigsaw-puzzle-like configuration of its heterogeneous pieces may also be read as a symbol of China’s cultural and ethnic diversity, asserting that while China remains distinctly singular, it is a fusion of countless individuals.

Zhao Wendu [Zhao Zuo] and Shen Ziju [Shen Shichong] were trivial and weak. They brought about many of the bad habits of the Yunjian School.

Sailing in Autumn,Xugu (Zhu Huairen),dated 1893,"Zhu Xubai joined the imperial army in 1851, but, finding that his sympathies lay with the Taiping rebels, he deserted and became a monk, taking the name Xu Gu. Alienated and without roots, he traveled between Yangzhou, Suzhou, and Shanghai selling his paintings. He had been trained in a portrait shop to paint the realistic ancestor images much in demand, but the majority of his paintings give little evidence of traditional training. His creativity lies in devising a light coloristic means of rendering the impression of things as they are seen.In the 1870s and 1880s figure painting in Shanghai was dominated by Ren Yi (1840C1896) and landscape painting, by Xu Gu. Xu's fresh artistic vision offered realistic scenery rather than idealized landscapes. In this riverside scene, his sketchy impression of lowland grasses and shrubs is novel in its use of irregular, loosely connected strokes rather than traditional formulas for constructing organic units. In the foreground the ink is dry, in the distance wet and blurred, in order to render the effects of intervening mist. Xu attempted to paint what he saw, a goal independently pursued by the European Impressionists. His radical departure from traditional intent and technique gives his pictures a vivid immediacy.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP162526.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49468

Studying a painting,Zhang Lu,16th century,"Zhang Lu was an aristocrat born into a wealthy family and educated with princes of the imperial family. He attained great success as a professional painter but lived very simply, almost as a hermit. He began his study of painting by emulating the leading court painter, Wang E (act. ca. 1490Cafter 1541), but quickly turned from the academy to other models and masters, most notably Wu Wei (1459C1508). This painting parodies the theme of the literary gathering. A group of rustics congregates around a hanging scroll as a man seated on a stone table holds forth on its virtues. A woman seated at her loom cranes her neck for a better view, a fisherman skeptically strokes his whiskers, a child darts underneath the scroll for a closer look, and the barefoot man unrolling the scroll squints critically at the image―a hawk pursuing a rabbit―which is a well-known composition by Zhang Lu himself.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT6388.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44612

Misty Bamboo on a Distant Mountain,Zheng Xie,dated 1753,"Zheng Xie passed the civil-service examination in 1736 and was appointed as magistrate in north China. Sympathetic with the plight of the people then in the throes of starvation, Zheng enforced extreme measures to improve their situation that met with resistance from the wealthier citizens in the area. His disillusionment with bureaucratic ethics, his disintegrating health, and his reputation tainted by scandal forced Zheng into early retirement. He settled in Yangzhou, then a prosperous community supportive of artists, where he became known as one of the Eight Eccentrics.This monumental four-panel painting depicts a grove of bamboo growing on a mountainside. The shallow pictorial space is defined by the placement of the stalks, which jut into view from the bottom of the composition, climb up the paper as if ascending a slope, and extend well beyond the top of the picture. It is further defined by the dramatic use of graded ink washes―from jet black to pale gray―that suggest the veiling effects of a dense mist. The artist inscribed the painting twice: in the upper right, with a title and date, and at the lower left, with his signature and seals.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT6515.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44620

Boating beneath Echo Hill,Mei Qing,datable to 1673,"Mei Qing was born into a prominent family in Xuancheng, Anhui Province. Following the family tradition of scholarship, Mei passed the provincial (jüren) civil-service examination in 1654 and traveled to the capital to sit for the capital (jinshi) examination, which he took and failed four times, before giving up in 1667. Mei returned home and became involved in local scholarly pursuits and participated in a poetry and painting society to which the painter Shitao (1642C1707) also belonged.This painting commemorates an outing that Mei and family members and friends made to Echo Hill (Xiangshan). Mei and some of the participants inscribed poems on the painting to further celebrate the occasion. Although the name of the recipient has been effaced, two seals belonging to Zheng Min (1633C1683), a noted painter from the Yellow Mountain region of Anhui, suggest that it may have been intended for him.Throughout his career, Mei drew inspiration from actual topographic features. Here, he emphasizes Echo Hill’s precipitous cliff face overhanging the river. Although a relatively early work, the painting exhibits the hallmarks of Mei’s eccentric style: an unbalanced composition animated by the powerful thrusting shape of the cliff and an interest in contrasting ink tones and textures, as seen in the way the dry-brush contour lines of the landscape are set off by the delicate blades of grass and dark ink foliage dots.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-35706-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/37394
Fruit,Ding Fuzhi,dated 1945,"With the discovery of oracle-bone scripts at the turn of the twentieth century, painting was stimulated by another wave of influence from calligraphy.The pictograms―functioning as word, image, and concept―were an important stimulus for Ding Fuzhi. His inscription on this painting is composed of characters adapted from Shang oracle bones.Ding depicted the characteristic silhouette of each piece of fruit, consciously playing the naive quality of the painted image against its counterpart, the primitive script. At the same time, his command of oracle-bone script and his analytic understanding of form as color are utterly sophisticated.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT8408.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49663
Two Prose Poems:"Mt. Tiantai" and "Parrot",Dong Qichang,1610,"明 董其昌 小楷天台W^二x  本The seventeenth-century interest in eccentricity and innovation was in part a reaction to Dong Qichang achievements, which took the elegance of the classical tradition to such heights that some felt there was nothing left to achieve. These albums capture Dong’s understated sophistication as well as his somewhat regimented style. The characters are arranged meticulously into rail-straight columns of twelve. The structures of the characters themselves are supremely balanced between top and bottom, left and right. The brushwork is precise yet fluid. The ink, rich but with a hint of tonal variation and transparency, is of the highest quality.Displayed here are pages from two separate but related albums: one is handwritten by Dong Qichang and the other is a rubbing taken from it. Studying the work of great calligraphers, both past and present, was of critical importance in learning calligraphy. Since the majority of calligraphers did not have access to genuine works, they had to rely on other sources, such as rubbings. To create a rubbing, the original calligraphy was traced, then transferred and carved onto a stone or woodblock, from which many impressions could be made and studied. This technology also allowed calligraphers in pre-modern China to gain empire-wide fame in their own lifetime through reproductions of their work. Dong’s calligraphy consists of partial transcriptions of two rhymed prose poems entitled “Mt. Tiantai” and “ Parrot,” composed by Sun Chuo (314C371) and Mi Heng (173C198), respectively.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP325258_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78833
Searching the Mountains for Demons,Zheng Zhong,17th century,"Zheng Zhong, a professional painter from Anhui, practiced his art in the cosmopolitan city of Nanjing. Zheng was skilled in the blue-and-green style of landscape and in Buddhist subjects that he could paint in either an intricate or an expressive manner, much like his more famous contemporaries specializing in Buddhist subjects, Wu Bin (act. ca. 1583C1626) and Din Yunpeng (1547Cca. 1621).Searching the Mountain for Demons illustrates the popular legend of the god Erlang, who was credited with defeating a vicious flood-arousing dragon and other demonic creatures on Mount Guankou in Sichuan. The god represents a metamorphosis of Li Bing, who helped control flooding and established a system of irrigation when he served as governor of Chengdu in the third century B.C., and of a regional hunting deity known for his control over mountain animals. The cult of Erlang became popular in Sichuan under the patronage of the later Shu emperor Meng Chang (r. 934C65). In 965, when the Song dynasty conquered the kingdom, it adopted the cult, erecting temples to the god in the capital and throughout China. The first illustration of Searching the Mountain appeared in the tenth century; today, two Southern Song and six Ming versions―including this one―are known.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP205494_CDR.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44630

Landscape,Wang Chen,dated 1788,"In the late seventeenth century, a group of painters who have come to be known as the “Four Wangs” built upon Dong Qichang’s legacy to bring energy and excitement to the study of old master styles. The youngest of these, Wang Yuanqi, exerted a great influence on younger painters, including his grandson Wang Chen, whose fan you see here.

Autumn landscape with egrets and ducks,Lü Ji,late 15th century,"Lü Ji, a professional painter from Zhejiang Province, worked in the Southern Song (1127C1279) ink-wash style, which had remained popular in that region through the intervening centuries. He was summoned to be a court painter in the Hongzhi period (1488C1505) and was given an honorary title as an officer in the imperial guard. The artist's paintings, done in a dashing descriptive style that was highly regarded at court, were derided by Shen Zhou (1427C1509), the leading scholar-painter of the time, as being merely works ""of the hand""; Shen considered his own calligraphic drawings to be products ""of the heart."" The contrast between the hand and the heart highlights the presumed difference between the works of the ""professional"" artists and those of the ""scholar-amateur"" painters of the Ming period.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP328710.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41471
Bamboo and poem,Zhu Lu,early 17th century,"Zhu Lu was an impoverished scholar from Suzhou who devoted himself to bamboo painting and poetry. This folding fan combines the two into an elegant composition: a wispy tendril of young bamboo reaches in from the right side, pointing toward the artist’s poem, which reads, in part:New branches, half newly grown green sheaves;Jade feeling, how richly shaped and carved!I linger, come to hidden blue-green colors;Here all suits my heart, nothing is at odds.―Translation by Jonathan Chaves",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153839.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49256

Farewell by a Stream on a Clear Day,Zhao Yuan,second half 14th century,"Zhao Yuan was a member of Suzhou literary circles and a close friend of many late Yuan scholar-painters, including Ni Zan (1306-1374) and Wang Meng (ca. 1308-1385).Farewell by a Stream on a Clear Day is painted in a style similar to that of Wang Meng. Wang's powerfully expressive brushwork here becomes a vivacious pictorial surface. Zhao's use of dots is especially remarkable; varying in size, shape, darkness, and touch, they not only serve a representational function but also effectively control the overall texture and tonality of the painting. Zhao Yuan's career, like that of many other notable Jiangnan painters, was cut short by the first Ming emperor (r. 1368-98), a man of humble origins who was deeply suspicious of the Suzhou intelligentsia. After summoning Zhao to Nanjing to serve as a painter, the emperor took offense at something Zhao did and had him executed.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP235481.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45647

Poems dedicated to Shen Shiyou,Wang Duo,1650,"清 王I 草沈石友 卷 本Wang Duo reveled in the accidental effects of saturation, particularly on satin, where the ink would absorb into the weave in strange and compelling ways. Throughout this long handscroll, at the points where Wang paused to reload his brush, the ink bleeds and pools, in some cases nearly obscuring the character he has written.

This intimate painting and poem portray Chen as Wang knew him―as a homeless refugee living in rustic seclusion near Wang's home at Yellow Crane Mountain. Wang's poem reads:In the empty grove the whistling wind makes the leaves dance;The thatch pavilion is lonely under the noonday sun.All day long a southerly wind ripples the green waves;In a gauze cap of coarse hemp one feels no trace of summer's heat.This rustic's dwelling is near Yellow Crane Peak;In the evening he enters a deserted grotto and listens to the mountain rain.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP160429.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44702

Wang Duo too lived in a time of turmoil, and he was inspired by Du Fu to create his own set of “Autumn Moods.” Wang’s insertion of explanatory comments between the poems in much smaller characters not only creates a visual demarcation but also a sense of intimacy, as though he is whispering secrets to the viewer. Wang’s rejection of classical elegance is evident throughout this scroll, in his habit of letting the brush dry out almost completely before reloading it; in his abrupt, angular turns at the end of characters; and in his irregular character sizing and lineation.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP325369_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78851
Eight poems,Xiong Tingbi,undated,"明 熊廷弼 行八 卷 本After passing the highest level of imperial examinations, Xiong Tingbi built a career as a military leader. He rose to take charge of military affairs in the northeast, where he was tasked with defending the Great Wall against the Manchus, who would ultimately invade China and found the Qing dynasty. After early success in strengthening local defense, Xiong was accused of deserting his post in battle and was executed unjustly in 1625.Though not well known as a calligrapher, Xiong had a confident and bold hand. In this work, he transcribes eight of his poems on a monumental scale. Over thirty feet long with each character nearly five inches tall, the work represents a challenge to the mainstream genteel aesthetic of the time.

Dissatisfied with what he saw as futile attempts to recapture the elegance of Zhao Mengfu (1254C1322) and Dong Qichang (1555C1636), Zheng went in the other direction, seeking to achieve a sense of na?veté and awkwardness in his writing by incorporating elements of ancient stone inscriptions. This work is a mature example of Zheng’s accomplishments: blunt yet fluid, it is written in a hybrid script of his own creation that lies somewhere between regular and clerical, with touches of cursive and semicursive.

Instructions on Painting Plum Blossoms,He Shaoji,undated,"清 何B基 _梅E 卷 本Handscrolls were rarely used by Epigraphic School calligraphers, whose oversized characters and high-impact graphic forms generally called for larger formats. He Shaoji breaks with that trend here, inscribing a text on the proper technique for painting plum blossoms in clerical script, with two large characters per line. Handscrolls are intended to be viewed on a table at arm’s length, and He Shaoji’s powerful, archaic forms and bold brushwork would have been particularly impressive at such a close range. His wavering line, extreme variations of thick and thin in the brushwork, and willingness to saturate the paper after reloading his brush are all typical of his style, a kind of old-fashioned and casual rusticity.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/EX 2012.2.011_01_edt.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78837

"""Splashed-color"" landscape",Zhang Daqian,1965,"After 1949 Zhang Daqian lived in Hong Kong and India before building residences in Brazil, California, and Taiwan. His long residency outside China inevitably brought him into contact with modern Western art, including Abstract Expressionism. This work, painted with intense mineral colors and broad washes of layered ink, may represent Zhang's response to these influences.Zhang maintained that such works, which he first made in Europe in 1956, derived from the ""broken-ink"" techniques of random splashing and soaking used by Tang-dynasty (618-906) artists, but it seems more likely that Western abstract art encouraged him to develop the Japanese technique of splashed colors that he had used in earlier works. He welcomed the liberating effect of this painting mode, which gave a spontaneity to his compositions. In spite of their abstract qualities, however, these paintings remain resolutely descriptive of the natural world. Here, Zhang applied ink and color in a seemingly random manner, then added contour lines and other details that transform the composition into a highly suggestive vision of storm―engulfed mountains illuminated by a burst of sunlight that has turned the somber clouds iridescent.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-31965-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49805

Departing from the characteristic Anhui School idiom of linear forms rendered with dry brushstrokes and minimal texturing, he animated his compositions with quivering lines and animated ink dots that cause the surfaces of his pictures to vibrate.According to his finely brushed inscription, Cheng painted this landscape for a Mr. Bai’an in Nanjing after recovering from an eye ailment.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_34.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76507

Shrimp and Fish,Shao Shaoyi,dated 1936,"By the 1930s Qi Baishi was creating his images of fish, fruit and flowers with calligraphic brushwork. Calligraphy teaches a prescribed sequence of individual brush strokes to render an idea as an image. Within the prescribed limits the image takes its life from the vitality and character of the act of writing. The thing signified is in effect, created, not imitated in the character. As Qi began to organize his images according to these calligraphic principles, Shao Shaoyi followed suit.

Untitled,Qiu Shihua,1996,"This minimalist painting along with the two adjacent works come from Qiu’s on-going series in which barely detectable traces of imagined landscapes only reveal themselves incrementally upon sustained observation. Executed in oil―often on unprimed canvas―each image is created through the application of many layers of dilute, semitransparent paint until the underlying landscape details that Qiu has painted in black or colors all but vanish in the overall whiteness of the composition. Never titled, Qiu’s paintings remain purely visual experiences that are evocative of the aesthetic of “serene blandness” ( pingdan), highly prized in the traditional literati canon.

Simple Retreat,Wang Meng,ca. 1370,"Wang Meng depicted scholars in their retreats, creating imaginary portraits that capture not the physical likeness of a person or place but rather an interior world of shared associations and ideals. He presented the master of Simple Retreat as a gentleman recluse. Seated at the front gate of a rustic hermitage, he is shown holding a magic fungus, as a servant and two deer approach from the woods. In the courtyard, another servant offers a sprig of herbs to a crane. The auspicious Daoist imagery of fungus, crane, and deer as well as the archaic simplicity of the figures and dwelling evokes a dreamlike vision of paradise.In creating this visionary world, Wang transformed the monumental landscape imagery of the tenth-century master Dong Yuan. Rocks and trees, animated with fluttering texture strokes, dots, color washes, and daubs of bright mineral pigment, pulse with a calligraphic energy barely contained within the traditional landscape structure. Encircled by this energized mountainscape, the retreat becomes a reservoir of calm at the vortex of a world whose dynamic configurations embody nature's creative potential but may also suggest the ever-shifting terrain of political power.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP274196.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39550

This work draws upon the highly representational style of the Southern Song (1127C1279) Imperial Painting Academy, merging exquisite drawing in fine contour lines with meticulously graded colored washes in a highly naturalistic image of great charm. The painting reflects Ren's keen observation of nature: a tiny bird, perched on one foot on an ornamental garden rock, bends its head to meet its uplifted foot, using wings and tail to maintain balance. Compared to his Song academic predecessors, Ren Xun brings his image closer to the viewer, cropping the bird's tail and the tree trunk, giving his picture immediacy and impact.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP161417.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49461
Studio by the Water,Chen Hengke,dated 1921,"From 1902 to 1909 Chen Hengke studied in Japan, where he witnessed the indigenous culture being rejected in the pursuit of material advantages from the West. He was determined that China would not follow the same course. After his return from Japan, he taught at colleges in Nantong, Changsha, and Beijing, becoming an influential historian of the literati tradition and a leading painter and calligrapher in Beijing.This work shows the kind of artless simplicity that was at the core of Chen's vision. While he used conventional media and techniques, he avoided overt references to earlier stylistic sources in order to express his own presence. The carefree ease of the scholar looking out from his studio is conveyed simply and directly through Chen's joyful brushwork: the buoyant lines of the pavilion―not one of which is straight―the casual ripples of the water, and the rhythmically repeated pattern of the foliage all communicate a sense of the artist's contentment.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP162547.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49603
Quatrain on Heavenly Mountain,Emperor Gaozong,after 1162,"In 1162, at the age of fifty-five, Gaozong retired from the throne to devote his final years to the arts, especially the study of calligraphy.

This fan clearly dates after 1162; written in the Wang style, it bears a seal with the name of Gaozong's retirement palace, Virtuous Longevity.The poem, laden with occult and astrological references, reads in part:Dark [. . .] from Heavenly Mountain divides the turbid and the vast.Ministered by the second hexagram, the elixir pours in a liquid jade.As I stand at the north-northeast and the south-southwest gates of the compass,I see the flash of rosy lights, ten thousand feet in the air.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153494.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40058

Viewing Antiquities at the Studio of Humility,Qi Baishi,dated 1931,"When he was in his sixties, Qi Baishi applied calligraphic brushwork to other genres of painting, particularly landscape. Viewing Antiquities at the Studio of Humility effortlessly incorporates an archaic color scheme and landscape forms into an image of deceptive simplicity. The painting depicts a solitary gentleman in his study, arms folded on the table, contemplating a tray of objects. The scholar appears at home in a world of blue and red hills and schematic trees, motifs that convey Qi's knowledge of sixth-century murals at the Buddhist cave temples at Dunhuang but that are incorporated in an unpedantic manner in harmony with his folklike vision.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP162621.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49650

Angling in the Autumn River,Sheng Zhu,ca. 1370,"Both this painting and Recluse Fisherman, Autumn Trees by Sheng Zhu's uncle Sheng Mou are executed in a brush idiom that recalls the Five Dynasties tradition of Dong Yuan (active 930s-960s) and Juran (active ca. 960-95), in which ""hemp-fiber"" texture strokes were applied in round parallel brushstrokes and plump ""moss dots"" were used to model the rocks. An insistent kinesthetic energy in Sheng Mou's brushwork relates it to that of Wu Zhen (1280-1354); the nephew's more casual style of painting introduces a new, relaxed feeling into the landscape and figural elements.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP235583.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42261

Wintry plum,Ni Jing,14th century,"Plum blossoms were first depicted as an independent subject by the eleventh-century Chan (Zen, in Japanese) monk Zhongren Huaguang. In this work by the otherwise unknown Buddhist monk Ni Jing, both composition and brushwork derive from the renowned Yuan-dynasty plum painter Wang Mian (d. 1359). The plum, the first flower to appear in spring, is celebrated along with bamboo and pine as one of the Three Friends of Winter. Admired for its purity and hardiness, sending forth new shoots and delicate blossoms from seemingly lifeless branches, the plum became a symbol of survival, rejuvenation, and longevity. Here, the tight clusters of pale blossoms and buds indicate that the plum has just begun to flower.

Landscapes after old masters,Dong Qichang,dated 1630,"This album demonstrates Dong Qichang's interpretation of the entire spectrum of Song and Yuan styles using a set of contrasting brushstroke methods, which could also be used for depicting actual landscapes. The great theorist and painter took as his point of departure the works of the Yuan master Ni Zan (1306C1374), whose paintings were regarded as calligraphic abstractions of earlier Song styles. In the first two leaves, Dong contrasts―in what he regards as the early and late styles of Ni Zan's art―an ""earthen"" landscape (round, parallel, ""hemp-fiber"" brushstrokes) with a ""rocky"" one (angular, oblique, ""folded-ribbon"" brushstrokes).

Landscape,Zhang Ruitu,early 17th century,"After passing the palace examination with high honors in 1607, Zhang Ruitu held a number of important government posts before being elevated to the grand secretariat in 1626 through the support of the powerful eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568C1627). Zhang, a renowned calligrapher, won favor with Wei by writing out texts composed in the eunuch's honor. Although Zhang retired from office in 1628, shortly after Wei's downfall (and decapitation), he was later listed as one of the eunuch's followers and escaped imprisonment only by paying a large fine. He spent his last years in his native Fujian, and most of his paintings date to that period. Renouncing Dong Qichang's (1555C1636) emphasis on dynamic brushwork and calligraphic abstraction, Zhang developed his own lyrical interpretation of the Northern Song monumental landscape style. His Song sources are apparent here in the use of satin rather than paper, the elongated vertical format, the dense buildup of texture strokes, and the tripartite separation of foreground, middle ground, and distant elements. Zhang's poetic couplet is inscribed in his powerful regular script:A boat moves from the city wall into the trees;The riverbanks are far apart and the water reflects the sky.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-13878-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/48968

Landscape with great pine,Ma Lin,second quarter 13th century,"The reductionist transformation from Northern Song monumental landscapes to symbolic images of single rocks and trees is complete with the work of Ma Lin. Ma's painting turns away from the realism of earlier Song Imperial Painting Academy works in favor of a new abstraction. In the absence of an accompanying poem, the meaning of this complex scene remains unclear. The Daoist-inspired imagery seems to hold out the promise of transcendence or escape. Outdoor altars are places of worship and meditation, cranes are known as the vehicles and companions of Daoist immortals, the evergreen pine is an emblem of longevity, and the full moon recalls the palace of the moon goddess, Chang E, whose hare prepares the elixir of immortality. Yet the immortals have not come, and the moon is far away. The figure is anchored to this world and can no more reach the moon than can the outstretched branches of the pine. There is a sense of brooding and foreboding in the tortuous, restless form of the tree that may well be influenced by the impending threat of Mongol invasion.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153508.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36055

Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva,Unidentified artist,late 17thCearly 18th century,"About 1900 the French Sinologist Paul Pelliot acquired a large group of paintings in Beijing that had come from a Qing imperial repository. Included in that group was a partial set of paintings that were created for the Water-Land ritual, a Buddhist mortuary ceremony conducted for the salvation of all the souls of the dead, whether on land or at sea. This painting may have come from the same set.A cartouche in the upper right corner of the composition identifies the deity portrayed here as Mahasthamaprapta (Dashizhi, in Chinese), a bodhisattva or enlightened being whose name means ""one who has attained great power."" Seated on a strikingly realistic lion mount and accompanied by a female attendant bearing a pearl, the bodhisattva holds the stem of a lotus with two blossoms that appear above his shoulders, one supporting a pearl, the other a thunderbolt-like implement (vajra). His right hand forms the mudra for charity. Most likely, this painting would have been displayed as part of a triptych together with an image of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin) and a central image of the Amitabha (Miluo) Buddha.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/53_130_1.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36069
Wrist rest decorated with long beans,Jin Xiya,1925,"This wrist rest is an excellent example of bamboo carving by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. It showcases Jin’s virtuosic command of traditional bamboo carving. His works incorporate compositions from designs contributed by important modern artists, such as Jin Cheng (1878C1926) on this piece. Jin’s works not only represent the highest achievement of bamboo carving in early twentieth century China, but they also preserve a microcosm of the literati world of that time, when members of the scholarly elite sought to sustain inherited traditions in the face of a rapidly modernizing world.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (wrist rest #29), the bamboo carving was completed on February 17, 1925.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-20116-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/839222
Wrist rest decorated with an ear of corn and ladybug,Jin Xiya,1924,"This wrist rest is an excellent example of bamboo carving by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. It showcases Jin’s virtuosic command of traditional bamboo carving as well as his creative experimentation. The artist has not only meticulously conveyed the varied textures of the stalk, leaves, and kernels, but by varying the density of striations between the broad lines of a leaf and the denser lines of the sheaf around the ear of corn, he has also conveyed a sense of overlapping forms. He has further enlivened his compositions by adding insects―a ladybug on the tassel of one ear of corn. Although it is based on a design contributed by the artist’s brother Jin Cheng (1876C1926), as indicated in the inscriptions, the decision to adopt such an unusual subject and its perfect translation onto bamboo are clear reflections of Jin Xiya’s creative personality.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (wrist rest #26), the bamboo carving was completed on December 16, 1924.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-20113-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/839219
Listening to the Zither Among Streams and Pines,Xie Shichen,未知年代,"Xie Shichen was a versatile artist whose paintings share features of both the Zhe School professionals and the Suzhou scholar-artists. Xie's ""hemp-fiber"" texture strokes and dark foliage dots derive from the eminent Suzhou amateur Shen Zhou (1427C1509), but his monumental composition, narrative subject matter, and bold brushwork owe more to the Nanjing professional Wu Wei (1459C1508). In this painting, a pair of scholars on a spring outing have paused to admire a blossoming plum tree that grows beneath the sheltering branches of an ancient pine. The nearby mountain torrent flows out of a deep valley where dense white clouds obscure the lower halves of precipitous peaks, including the towering central monolith whose position along the painting's vertical axis serves as an anchor to the entire composition. To the left of the peak, Xie inscribed a seven-character quatrain along with his signature.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/1982_1_9_O.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36138
Wrist rest decorated with gourds,Jin Xiya,1922,"This wrist rest is an excellent example of bamboo carving by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. It perfectly demonstrates Jin’s command of intaglio carving at an early stage in his career. The décor, following a design contributed by his brother Jin Cheng (1876C1926), is engraved into the bamboo’s curved surface in fine “iron wire” lines that nonetheless capture the twisting and turning of the foliage. The outlines of the gourds were emphasized with broader, beveled intaglio lines that give the gourds a more three-dimensional appearance. The incised inscription also conveys the varied modulations of Jin Cheng’s calligraphy.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (wrist rest #9), the bamboo carving was completed on September 6, 1922.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-20432-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/839216
"Wrist rest decorated with geese, sparrows, bamboo, and rock",Jin Xiya,1945,"This wrist rest is an excellent example of bamboo carving by Jin Xiya, the finest bamboo artist active in twentieth-century China. Here, Jin demonstrates his proficiency by combining several carving styles in a single work. The birds and bamboo stand forth in high “green skin” relief, while the garden rock with dots of moss appears in low relief against a ground of vertical striations suggestive of the bamboo’s grain. Similarly, the geese stand on a pathway of smooth paving stones that leads to a wicker gate. A final tour de force of carving is the way the layered feathers and webbed feet of the geese are rendered. One goose’s beak is open with its tongue sticking up as if it were honking loudly―further animating this remarkable scene.According to the archival list of Jin’s works (wrist rest #53), this wrist rest took him forty-two days to complete on January 31, 1945.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-20115-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/839221

Yangzi River Gorge,Fu Baoshi,1947,"In tones of smoky blue and light sienna, Fu Baoshi presents the precipitous drama of the Yangzi River gorges as a wall of rock engulfing a small triangle of river. Boats diminish in scale as they sail downriver on choppy waves that are rendered in quick, swiping strokes of dilute ink against the white ground. On the sheer fliff faces, hints of trees and rocky textures are suggested by swirls and swipes of ink mixed with broad washes. Fu Baoshi painted this dark, brooding depiction of a majestic Yangzi River Gorge in 1947, after returning from Sichuan to his native Nanjing.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-17989-116.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/772742
"[Group Portrait near Fangguangyan Monastery, Fujian]",Lai Afong,ca. 1869,"Around 1869, Lai Fong was invited by foreign residents of Fuzhou to record a private excursion by boat to the Fangguangyan Monastery, a “hanging temple” known for its spectacular location and design. Lai posed the group for photographs at several spots along the route.The rather illustrious expedition party included Charles Sinclair, the British Consult of Fuzhou, who sits on the stool at left; Sinclair’s wife, who leans against the rock wall; Baron de Me?ritens, an Imperial Maritime Customs Service commissioner, who perches on a rock at center; Prosper Giquel, Director of the Fuzhou Arsenal, who stands by Sinclair’s wife; and Francis Temple, an accountant at the Shanghai branch of the Oriental Bank, who is stretched out informally in the foreground.

Cinnabar Chamber Deep in the Mountains,Hongren,dated 1656,"Hongren was the most important and original of the Anhui School artists. A filial son, he may have joined the resistance movement against the Manchu invaders before renouncing all worldly ties by becoming a Buddhist monk. His landscape painting, inspired by the spare linear style of the recluse-artist Ni Zan (1306C1374) and by the chiseled topography of Anhui’s Yellow Mountain, made him a leading individualist artist of the time.This large scroll superbly embodies Hongren’s synthetic approach to painting. The central rock mass evokes eleventh-century monumental landscapes; the modular geometric structure of the central bluff and dry crumbly brushwork recall fourteenth-century masters’ formal experiments; and the arbitrary manipulation of scale reflects the late Ming disregard of naturalism.Hongren painted this work as a birthday present for a friend. In his inscription he wishes the recipient longevity and refers to the main structure in the painting as the cinnabar chamber where the elixir of immortality was produced.cat. no. 40",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_40.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76513
Reminiscence of Jinling,Wang Gai,1686,"Wang Gai was a gifted stylist who worked in the vibrant city of Nanjing in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.

"Divine Light Series No. 59, The Floating Incomplete Circle",Zhang Yu,1998,"A leading figure of “experimental ink” since the 1990s, Zhang has sought to bridge disparate artistic traditions across time and culture through mining the potential of the ink medium in nonfigurative work. In this monumental piece from Zhang’s Divine Light series, a giant circle surrounded by a radiant halo is suspended in a dark “sky” spangled with starlike dots of uninked paper. In the darkness above the sphere, the artist has impressed a single small seal that reads “Shiyu bi” (Brush of Shiyu)―Shiyu, or “stone rain,” being Zhang’s sobriquet. Dwarfed by the scale of the sphere, the red seal nonetheless declares man’s presence within this vast firmament, an allusion to the artist as creator.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/MIC32_37.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77567
Song of the Lute,Ding Yunpeng,1585,"On a chilly autumn evening in 816 CE, the poet Bai Juyi was seeing a friend off at a ferry stop when he heard the sound of a lute drifting across the water. Following the music, he came to a boat from which an aging courtesan issued her mournful song across the darkening river. Moved by the melancholy dignity of the scene, Bai wrote “Song of the Lute” in honor of the courtesan. In this rendering of the famous poem, the only indication of night is the candle between Bai and his friend as they sit in their boat, transfixed by the beauty of the music.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-16368-003.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/35970
"100 Layers of Ink, No.1",Yang Jiechang,1994,"For a decade between 1989 and 1999, Yang worked on the series 100 Layers of Ink, to which this work (one from a set of three) belongs. It is the result of focused repetition: Yang applied ink to the same pieces of paper, day after day, until the paper was completely saturated. As the paper reaches saturation, the ink takes on a shimmery, luminescent quality, and the paper itself shifts from a two-dimensional surface to a three-dimensional object, merging figure and ground, coming close to sculpture. Though these are the same materials used by literati to make traditional paintings, Yang has reinvented them here, removing entirely the artist’s gesture as an index of meaning.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/ABS_Fig.09r2_66I.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77566
View of Tide,Yang Yongliang,2008,"This composite photograph takes the form of a panoramic handscroll that presents a succession of towering mountains wreathed in mist and surrounded by expanses of open water. But upon closer examination, the majestic mountains are revealed to be composed of countless high-rise apartments and other buildings, while the “trees” are actually power-line towers and construction cranes―the ubiquitous icons of New China. What initially appears to be a pristine image of nature’s grandeur is suddenly exposed as an entirely man-made environment, except for the watery passages comprising images of actual waves and waterfalls. Created through Yang’s distinctive method of “painting” with digital photography, the seemingly harmonious traditional landscape becomes a subtle yet critical response to urbanization.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/YangYongliang_View_of_tide_detail_1_courtesy18Gallery_Magda Danysz.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77548
Being Open and Empty,Wang Dongling,2005,"A prominent example of Wang’s monumental calligraphic abstraction, this hanging scroll features powerfully inked lines that convey a vivid sense of the artist’s physical engagement with the work. The interaction of ink and ground―especially the spatters and streaks that communicate the impact and momentum of the brush―is crucial to its appreciation. The white paper is not simply the absence of ink, it is the picture “space” into which Wang’s ink structure is thrust. The title, borrowed from a phrase in the Daoist classic Zhuangzi (ca. 300 B.C.), refers to a state of enlightenment achieved through ridding one’s mind of mundane trifles. Its literal meaning, however, “protect the white” (shou bai), may also reflect Wang’s awareness of the uninked paper as a significant component of the whole.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/Fig  113_detail 2_Wang Dongling_Being Open and Empty.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77570
Mountain Scenery with Streams and Pavilions in the Style of Fan Kuan,Wang Jian,1667,"Wang Jian studied with the influential painter-theorist Dong Qichang.

In this work, Wang explores the manner of the great eleventh-century artist Fan Kuan, adopting the earlier master’s jagged contour lines and signature “raindrop” texture stroke to add a tactile quality to the rocky cliffs.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-2015_788_sr1_03.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/701452
Mythos of Lost Dynasties Series―I Evaluate Characters Written by Three Men and Three Women,Gu Wenda,1985,"In this important early experimental work, Gu problematizes the written word by inviting six of his students at the Zhejiang Academy (where he taught from 1981 to 1987) to each write on a sheet of paper a large-scale variation of the character “quiet” (jing 静). No two characters are written the same way: some resemble early seal script, while others are deliberately miswritten. Gu then added spatters of ink to the characters before using red pigment either to cross out the characters with an “X” or to indicate approval with a circle. Such marks were a traditional way for teachers to indicate whether a character had been written correctly, but they also were a powerful reminder of the Cultural Revolution when, in Gu’s words, “You cross out the bad person, and leave the good person.” Here, Gu has kept his evaluation standards ambiguous, calling into question the validity of any cultural or political value system.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/14-1.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77536
Ink Handscroll,Liu Dan,1990,"Liu began working on this imposing painting shortly after the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square were crushed by military intervention in 1989; it took more than a year to complete. Liu is said to have been inspired by the form of a flickering candle flame, which may be why he chose to begin the scroll with roiling jets of cinnabar pigment and plumes of white. As the scroll unfurls, the red dissipates into grays and blacks, while the white areas morph into shapes suggestive of clouds, watercourses, jagged ice outcrops, or crystalline inclusions but, almost never, patches of sky. This uninhabitable landscape shows no sign of human presence. It is modeled in lines of uniform thickness created by a centered brush tip (zhongfeng)―a method derived from calligraphy. While the hatch marks recall Western methods of shading, there is no consistent light source. Instead, the shifting tonalities represent a rhythmic interplay of positive and negative patterns that defy any logical reading of mass or space.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LiuDanInkHandscroll_Det.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77486

It is the result of focused repetition: Yang applied ink to the same pieces of paper, day after day, until the paper was completely saturated. As the paper reaches saturation, the ink takes on a shimmery, luminescent quality, and the paper itself shifts from a two-dimensional surface to a three-dimensional object, merging figure and ground, coming close to sculpture.

Urban Fiction No. 13,Xing Danwen,2005,"With Urban Fiction, a series beginning in 2004, Xing explores the form and psyche of contemporary living in modern high-rise “palaces of the people.” In these large-scale color photographs of real-estate developers’ architectural models, Xing has digitally inserted tiny cutout figures to enact a variety of imaginary human dramas. While these figures form only a tiny part of each image, their actions―often carried out by the artist herself―become the focal point of an otherwise sterile environment. Whatever action we are voyeuristically invited to witness is placed within a fictional setting in which there is no other trace of genuine human activity. Xing implies that the dream of luxury, modernity, and a better life that these maquettes are intended to convey may sometimes induce isolation and loneliness.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/MH2_Fig.45r1_66G.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78301

Cloudy mountains,Fa Ruozhen,1684,"Fa Ruozhen is known for his fantastical mountainscapes permeated with clouds. This imposing landscape, painted in 1684 when the artist was seventy-two years old and still in his prime, is an exceptionally well-realized composition by this important scholar-artist of the early Qing dynasty. While most of Fa's paintings are on paper, this work is executed on silk, which suggests that it was intended for an important recipient.Like a great cumulonimbus cloud, the landscape billows upward in roiling layers of earth punctuated by misty vales harboring half-concealed groves of trees. The composition is conceived in the classic ""three distances"" manner, with foreground trees and piled-up boulders giving way to a ridge line in the middle ground that is in turn overshadowed by distant rugged peaks. But Fa flattened forms and compressed distances to maximize the verticality of his restless landscape. Aided by the stream that meanders through the mountains, the judiciously placed passages of mist and cloud sustain the illusion of separation between the three distances, giving depth and mass to the agitated outcrops.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP227778.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/75745

"Crane, pine, and rock",Chen Zhaofeng,late 19th century,"Chen Zhaofeng painted for the court at the end of the nineteenth century, during the twilight of China’s imperial period. Although very little of his art survives, this example reveals a high level of technical accomplishment. The crane, pine, and rock are all symbols of longevity, making this painting appropriate to hang in a palace during a celebratory occasion such as an imperial birthday. Chen’s style follows that of the eighteenth-century court painter Shen Quan (1682Cafter 1762).

Landscape after Hua Yan,Liu Yanchong,1843,"A landscape of writhing, fantastic forms spreads across this small handscroll in muted tones of dilute ink and ochre. A mountain gate, visible in red at the summit of a pass, punctuates a hillside. A grove of wavy trees defines the foreground. Here and there, pilgrims move through the mountains. As the scroll unfurls, the landscape fades into nothingness, a void over which the artist has added a lengthy inscription.This painting is a nineteenth century interpretation by Liu Yanchong of an earlier work by the artist Hua Yan (1682C1756).

Liu Bei (161C223), founder of the state of Shu Han, was one figure who wished to become emperor. Seeking counsel, Liu visited the hut of the wise thinker and strategist Zhuge Liang, but Zhuge wished to remain in seclusion and refused to see him. Only after Liu humbled himself and visited three times did the sage agree to meet; this painting depicts the final visit.

The Progress of Village Wen,Yun-Fei Ji,2016,"The scroll depicts the forced migration of villagers from their rural homes to the city due to a governmental land policy in contemporary China. At once literal and symbolic, the composition evolves from mundane drudgery to hallucinatory chaos, suggesting that mental disintegration follows the physical dislocation. The title of the painting has an air of irony.As the people leave their ancestral land, village ghosts move alongside the living. The ominous supernatural imagery foreshadows what awaits the villagers in the city. In adapting to urban life, many of them lose their sense of identity and purpose, which was rooted in an agrarian community.

Landscape Painted on the Double Ninth Festival,Shitao (Zhu Ruoji),dated 1705,"Shitao painted this landscape for a young friend who visited him on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month―a festival traditionally celebrated by mountain climbing. Suddenly struck by his own old age, Shitao wrote this inscription:The days when I go climbing are few now and my walking staff no longer helps me. . . . When you were young, I was already in my prime; but suddenly, you are a man and I am old. The passage of time plays tricks on people; like mist or the moon, it cannot be trusted. The future is like a cloud or traces of decaying grass―how can one fathom it?(trans. Wen Feng)Shitao's painting is like a fleeting vision glimpsed through fog. As the fog lifts, an approaching skiff heralds the arrival of Shitao's friend, whose coming has the effect of clearing weather on the spirits of the housebound artist. Filling the sky above, Shitao's dedicatory poem is written in a buoyantly rhythmic version of ""clerical"" script.

Inn and Travelers in Snowy Mountains,Yuan Yao,1745,"This painting, with its extravagant depiction of the rigors of traveling in the mountains in winter, would have appealed to the merchants from the northern province of Shanxi. Inspired by fantastic garden rockeries rather than an actual landscape, Yuan Yao’s fanciful composition juxtaposes a twisting vertical mountainscape with a level vista where a playful zigzag bridge bisects the view. A distant range of precipitous peaks is straddled by a bridge ornamented with a pavilion―a typical garden conceit in the level terrain of south China―that is incongruously suspended over a deep chasm. In the foreground, a bustling country inn promises a welcome rest stop for travelers.Yuan first laid out this monochrome masterpiece with pale outlines then added broader, boldly brushed contours in varying ink tones that both model forms and enliven them with graphic energy. The result is a dynamic composition that appears to have been executed with great spontaneity―belying the care with which each motif was planned and rendered.

Here, he uses multiple brush modes―broad, chunky lines and washes for the tree, sharp, fine lines for the robe, and meticulous strokes for the face―to depict a woman leaning wistfully on a stone balustrade, bamboo flute in hand.

Wu avidly collected ancient bronzes, jades, and seals, and his interest in antiquities was partly inspired by his study of ancient scripts.

This intimate fan painting shows Xu working in a miniaturist style and a decorative blue-and-green technique that differs markedly from his typically grand imperial commissions. According to the artist’s long inscription, Xu was commanded by the emperor to paint this work as a birthday gift to a Mr. Li.Fanciful images of Daoist paradises were suitably auspicious subjects for birthday gifts.

When the Qing intervened in Annam in 1884 on behalf of the king against the French, Wu was sent to Tientsin to defend the city against the French attack. As governor of Guangdong, he negotiated customs duties on opium that continued to flow into the country through Canton and Macao, and without success recommended against ceding Macao to the Portuguese. As governor of Henan, he raised the standards of production in the lucrative silk and tea industries. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1894, Wu took troops to defend a strategic northern mountain pass.

Crows in Old Trees,Luo Zhichuan,early 14th century,"This painting, by the southern artist Luo Zhichuan, demonstrates the renewed interest in the brush idioms of the Northern Song artists Li Cheng (919C967) and Guo Xi (ca. 1000Cca. 1090) that grew after the Mongol conquest forcefully reunified north and south China in 1279. Luo’s painting may be read as a bleak commentary on life under the Mongols, for the image of a wintry grove of trees has long been understood as a metaphor for like-minded men enduring political adversity. Similarly, the two male pheasants on the shore in the foreground symbolize scholars living in reclusion, while the varied pattern (wen) of their plumage is a symbol of literary cultivation (also wen).

By the end of the century, he had become the most influential calligrapher of his age. Although Dong championed the aesthetic of monochromatic ink styles, he indulged in decorative effects in this album, using gold flecked paper with occasional mineral colors for the paintings and choosing a satin ground for his sleek cursive script. Each of the eight leaves, except number seven, is an homage to a past master paired with excerpts from Tang-dynasty landscape poetry.

The Yellow Pavilion,Xia Yong,ca.  1350,"Xia Yong carried the specialty of architectural renderings in the ""ruled-line"" (jiehua) manner to new heights of technical control. In contrast to his loosely described landscape elements, Xia's buildings are densely detailed and meticulously drawn. This predeliction for minute scale is also evident in the artist's microscopic inscription, which transcribes ""A Rhapsody on the Yellow Pavilion,"" an essay by the famous Northern Song scholar Su Che (1039C1112), the younger brother of the poet Su Shi (1037C1101).Su Che's inscription describes how the region around Xuzhou, in northern Jiangsu, was flooded in 1077, following a sudden break in the dikes of the Yellow River. Su Shi, then a prefect there, worked indefatigably to rescue the city from disaster. After the flood subsided and the city walls were repaired, the Yellow Pavilion was dedicated in his honor. Three centuries later, in 1344, the Yellow River flooded again, causing widespread destruction. By referring to a flood that occurred three centuries earlier―and concealing his real message by writing Su's text in a script so minute that few would actually have read it―Xia Yong obliquely signaled his awareness of the momentous social changes caused by the flood, which would lead to the downfall of the Yuan dynasty less than twenty years later.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153818.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41476

Imbued with Daoist mysticism, he painted landscapes that ""turned the shapeless into shapes and returned things that have shapes to the shapeless.""According to Daoist geomantic beliefs, a powerful life energy pulsates through mountain ranges and watercourses in patterns known as longmo (dragon veins). In Cloudy Mountains, the painter's kinetic brushwork, wound up as if in a whirlwind, charges the mountains with an expressive liveliness that defies their physical structure.

Couplet on Water and Flowers,Feng Kanghou,dated 1972,"In this work, Feng Kanghou transcribes a couplet from Hong Yingming's (fl. 1596) Thoughts on Vegetable Roots together with Hong's short commentary on the ideas expressed in his verse:However rapidly water flows, it is always tranquil in itself.Though their petals fall from time to time, flowers remain restful at heart.If we could deal with daily affairs and people with this attitude, there would be no inner disturbances.How carefree our bodies and minds would be!(trans. by Shi-yee Liu)Water and flowers remain serene though they are constantly busy flowing or shedding. They embody an attitude that transcends the bustle of daily activities by fulfilling their respective roles in life without psychological resistance. Hong clearly saw in this imagerya key to maintaining peace of mind while living in a clamorous society.Feng here freely mixes a surprising combination of the standard, clerical, and seal script characteristics.

Shaded Dwellings among Streams and Mountains,Dong Qichang,ca. 1622C25,"Dong Qichang, the foremost landscape painter and theorist of the early seventeenth century, pursued artistic reform. Reacting against what he perceived as the decadent, perverse trends of contemporary landscape painting, Dong, following in the literati tradition, sought a creative reconstruction of the past through the critical study of ancient styles. In an attempt to restore simplicity and vitality to painting, Dong advocated a spiritual correspondence with the art of the old masters rather than a literal imitation of them and underscored the importance of self-expression. Approaching painting as though it were calligraphy, Dong alternated positive and negative patterns in his landscapes, which resulted in a radical new kinesthetic style.Shaded Dwellings among Streams and Mountains, based on a work by the early master Dong Yuan (act. 930sC60s), is a complex calligraphic study of rock and tree forms conceived as an integration of abstract, cubic, and dynamically expressive masses that embody and are unified by the kinetic energy of the artist's physical movements.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-13850-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/48949

Li Bai gazing at the waterfall on Mount Lu,Zhong Li,late 15th century,"Nearly three hundred years after the death of the Song academician Ma Yuan (act. ca. 1190C1225), a Ming emperor proudly declared Zhong Li to be Ma Yuan reborn. Indeed, Zhong's works, painted in a typically bold, breezy, almost contemptuous manner, represent the end of the Ma Yuan tradition. Brought to this level of large-scale power, directness, and nearly total absence of subtlety or nuance, the tradition of Ma Yuan perhaps could not evolve further. Zhong Li was among the last great court painters in this lineage.This strongly painted composition, the best known of Zhong Li's signed works, is a classic Ming academic-style picture; it continues Dai Jin's (1388C1462) monumental refiguration of the Southern Song academic manner. The interior dynamics are even more spectacular than in earlier works in the tradition, from the explosive energies of the plunging waterfall and dramatically towering cliff face to the twisted pines coiling out like springs from the stone walls. There is also something quite imperial in the pose of the seated figure on the garden terrace, leaning back like the master of his universe to observe the potent forces of nature as they conduct a special performance for him alone.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT6780.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44703
Scholar in the Wind,Ren Xun,ca. 1880,"Ren Xun first studied painting with his elder brother, Ren Xiong (1820C1857), but his brother's death, when Xun was twenty-two, cut short the apprenticeship. Three years later he found patrons in Suzhou, and by the 1870s his fame had spread throughout the Yangzi River delta region and he had attracted a number of disciples. He maintained an active career until 1887, when deterioratiing eyesight forced him to curtail painting.In executing figures, Ren often followed Zhejiang artists' regional preference for the style of Ming dynasty professional painters of the so-called Zhe School: dashing virtuoso brushwork and large-scale figures drawn in animated outline strokes set within sketchy inkwash landscapes. Ren employed that style here to suggest a wintry gale pulling at the bare tree branches and whipping through the heavy robes of an intrepid stroller. The figure may be Ren's dramatic evocation of the plight of the traditional gentleman in the face of modernization. His dramatic brush style uses rapidly turning, modulated contour lines to convey graphically the twisting and fluttering folds of the scholar's garment, giving the figure a powerful sense of immediacy.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP161416.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49460
Lamp-lit Pavilion on a Rainy Night,Qi Baishi,dated 1933,"This work, painted when Qi was seventy-one, evokes a contemplative, even melancholy, mood. Broad streaks of wash and saturated blobs of ink convey a sense of moisture-suffused darkness and lonely isolation. A two-story hall, nearly engulfed by the dark silhouettes of the trees, offers the only sanctuary from the night, its uninked walls and interior standing forth as the sole bright spot in the picture. A scholar seated by a window reads a book by the light of a single lamp.Even though Qi had been a resident of Beijing for fifteen years when he painted this work, he still felt like a stranger there and had a lingering nostalgia for the simpler existence of his childhood home. His confidence in his own vision and his refusal to sink into sentimentality are demonstrated by his boldly brushed dedication, written in the sharp blocky stele style that stands in stark contrast to the soft blurry quality of the image.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-25336-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41495

Poem for Hanwen,Shen Zhou,dated 1493,"Shen Zhou modeled his writing after the running-regular script of Huang Tingjian (1045C1105); four major works by the Song master were in Shen's personal collection.Despite the small size of the writing on this fan, the characters show the tight interior organization, tall structure, and elongated diagonals and horizontals that are the hallmark of Huang Tingjian's style. In Shen's interpretation, the bony aspect of Huang's brushwork is stressed: the brushwork is simplified and, for the most part, lacks the small movements and stroke details that make the earlier master's writing so rich.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153569.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45684
Landscapes,Tang Yin,未知年代,"A brilliant scholar whose official career was cut short by his inadvertent involvement in an examination scandal in 1499, Tang Yin spent his life pursuing the diversions of an eccentric scholarly playboy; his adventures eventually entered popular legend. While most of his paintings reflect a pleasure-loving existence, this melancholy album explores the themes of struggle, sadness, and the refuge of solitude.While most of his fellow painters in the Suzhou area adopted the calligraphic styles of the Yuan scholar-artists, Tang was able to use the more descriptive ink-wash idiom of the Southern Song masters, particularly that of Li Tang (ca. 1070sCca. 1150s), to portray realistic scenery.

Landscapes in the styles of ancient masters,Wang Jian,17th century,"Wang Jian's paintings exemplify the vision of a man steeped in tradition. A member of the educated elite, Wang enjoyed access to the region's numerous private collections as well as inheriting a rich assemblage of old masters from his grandfather Wang Shizhen (1526C1590). This firsthand knowledge of past masterpieces inspired Wang to follow the example of Dong Qichang (1555C1636) in seeking a personal artistic synthesis through the diligent study of ""orthodox"" models.This album is a virtuoso display of Wang Jian's command over his tradition. Each leaf recalls a specific past master, yet each presents a new solution in which the model is transformed by the smaller, album format as well as by Wang's distinctive brush mannerisms.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT6151.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44591
Landscape album,Bada Shanren (Zhu Da),dated 1699,"A scion of a branch of the Ming imperial family, Bada Shanren became a ""crazy"" Buddhist monk, feigning deafness in order to escape persecution after the Ming dynasty fell to Manchu conquest in 1644. Like his cousin Shitao (Zhu Ruoji), he became an extraordinary painter, known for an expessionist calligraphic style.In these album-size landscapes, Bada has adopted traditional themes and compositions as points of departure for his own creative improvisations. In several leaves, the sparse composition, dry brushwork, and carefully selected motifs―bare trees and an empty pavilion―allude to the late Yuan hermit-artist Ni Zan (1306C1374). Elsewhere, diagonally receding mountain masses made of simplified ovoid and cone-shaped rock forms derive from the landscape style of Dong Qichang (1555C1636). In each case, however, Bada transmuted his models, playing with spatially ambiguous patterns or adding human figures or color when least expected.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP160560.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49145

Nine carp,Gong Gu,19th century (?),"A massive carp leads its eight offspring through thick aquatic grasses below the water’s surface. More than just cute animals, they allude to a line from China’s most ancient poetry collection, the Book of Odes (Shijing). It refers to “nine similitudes” (jiuru 九如)―nine comparisons that imply eternity or longevity (“like mountains,” “like streams,” and so on). Because the term for “similitude” (ru 如) sounds like the term for “fish” (yu ~), paintings of nine fish became conventional expressions of wishes for longevity and constancy. The painter Gong Gu is otherwise unknown, but the splashy brushwork and broad washes suggest a date from the mid- to late nineteenth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-16218-010.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/784284
Washing the White Elephant,Chen Zi,undated,"Chen Zi bore both the gift and the burden of being trained by his father Chen Hongshou, one of the most original figure painters ever to wield a brush. The junior Chen was taught to work in an identifiable style with a known market, but the shadow of his father’s accomplishment enveloped him, stifling further growth. This work shows Chen Zi’s competence in producing the exaggerated, caricatured figures for which his father was known, but it also reveals a stiffness that set in through the years of pursuing his father’s legacy. The subject is a play on words with Buddhist significance: “to wash the elephant” (saoxiang) is a homophone for “sweeping away attachments,” a key goal of Buddhist practice.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36804-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36120

Bodhidharma,Qi Baishi,dated 1913,"This painting, done when Qi Baishi was visiting Beijing, presents an image of the fifth-century Chan (Zen) patriarch that is accessible yet monumental. The monklike robe, shoe, and stubble of his shaven head are details that give Bodhidharma a contemporary appearance-not unlike Qi himself. But Qi's vision of the master remains beyond our reach. Except for cursory highlighting around the eye and cheek, Qi avoided Western-influenced tech-niques for rendering form and concealed most of the figure beneath the engulfing robe.Bodhidharma is depicted against a blank background; only the straw prayer mat and the hem of the robe hint at three-dimensional form. Although the bold outlines of the garment and the blunt, square calligraphy of the inscription show close stylistic affinities with the epigraphic school of writing practiced by Zhao Zhiqian (1829C1884), the expressive portrait exhibits the simplicity and directness that characterized Qi's mature style of the 1920s. In his inscription Qi reflects on his inspiration-a visit to Mount Song, where Bodhidharma meditated for nine years-and takes pleasure in acknowledging his own growing critical recognition. He recalls a poem about his painting of a Bodhidharma hung in a Beijing shop that inspired him to repeat his performance here.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-25331-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41505
Landscape,Kuncan,dated 1670,"It is uncertain when Kuncan took Buddhist monastic vows. After the establishment of the Manchu regime, he lived in Nanjing, where his friends included several artists emotionally tied to the vanquished Ming dynasty. Working exclusively in the landscape genre, Kuncan created dense, firmly structured compositions with brisk, staccato strokes to capture the vitality and abundance of nature. His talent for bringing coherence and grandeur out of complex landscape elements established him as a leading master of this period. Kuncan’s philosophical inscription on this hauntingly somber landscape reads:Master Cheng Lian [a musician, 7th century B.C.] transformed people’s temperament with the sound of ocean waves. Zong Shaowen [the landscape artist Zong Bing, 375C443] did it with echoes in the mountains. Temperament can be transformed to transcend romantic and worldly attachments. Mr. Wang Dengxian [active mid-17th century] studies in the Gaozuo Monastery [in Nanjing], taking rainy woods as his ocean waves and mountain echoes. Every day he strolls in them, chanting his literary compositions and, when gay, singing out loud while tapping trees [to keep time]. He lives as he wishes. My senior Ji once said, “As emotions arise, wisdom is blocked. When thoughts shift, the body changes in accord.” How can anyone say there is no transformation-inducing cinnabar in this process? I painted this landscape to amuse myself. When Mr. Wang saw it, I gave it to him as a present.cat. no. 44",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_44.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76517
The Stone Bridge,Zhang Feng,dated 1661,"Zhang Feng's father, a military governor, died in 1631 while defending the Ming dynasty against Manchu incursions. After the fall of the Ming in 1644, Zhang withdrew from society and entered the Buddhist church. This painting, one of Zhang's last dated works, epitomizes the bold, free brush manner of his maturity. It shows a lone scholar in a wintry landscape. Clutching a staff with hands drawn into his sleeves to protect them from the cold, he stands erect and motionless beside a stone bridge. The imagery recalls the natural stone arch at Mount Tiantai, a site sacred to Buddhists. Legend has it that anyone who succeeds in crossing the slippery arch will enter paradise and become an immortal. Zhang's autobiographical figure can neither attain paradise nor return whence he came; he is riveted to the harsh reality of the present, where he must face both his limitations and his mortality.Zhang's inscription reinforces the tension between the figure and his world:Who is it gripping an iron staff in the jade sprayThe torrent's waters ringing beneath the stone bridge?Snow, like flowers' souls, flies about without pause;The spring wind still awaits the mountain man's summons.From the poem it becomes clear that spring's renewal is not forthcoming―the scholar―recluse in the painting is no more able to summon the spring wind than Zhang is capable of restoring the fallen Ming.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/1993_202_O.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44720

Joyous Rain,Wu Kuan,ca. 1498,"Unlike most of his artistically inclined friends in Suzhou, Wu Kuan enjoyed a long and successful career as an official. He achieved first place in the palace examinations of 1472 and held a series of important posts at the court in Beijing, culminating with the office of secretary of the Board of Rites.Like other Ming literati from Suzhou, Wu Kuan's calligraphy was influenced by Northern Song (960C1127) models. With its fleshy, modulated brushstrokes and squat characters, Wu's writing style follows that of the poet-calligrapher Su Shi (1036C1101). Wu accompanied this poem with a brief account of the circumstances under which it was created: ""On the evening of the twenty-eighth of the fifth month [June 17], it began to rain after a long drought. I was collating Bo Juyi's [772C846] works and had just come to the poem 'Joyous Rain.'

"Mountain Market, Clearing Mist",Xia Gui,early 13th century,"This album leaf presents a poetic evocation of one of the Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers. The Eight Views became a popular subject for painters beginning in the late eleventh century after the Chan (Japanese: Zen) Buddhist monk Huihong (1071C1128) composed eight poems on these themes. His poem ""Mountain Market, Clear with Rising Mist"" offers vivid images for painters to interpret:Last night's rain is letting up, mountain air is heavy,Steam rising, sun and shadow, shifting lightamid trees;The silkworm market comes to a close, the crowdthins out,Roadside willows by the market bridge: goldenthreads play;Whose house with flower-filled plot is acrossthe valley?A smooth-tongued yellow bird calls in spring breeze;Wine flag in hazy distance-look and you can see:It's the one west of the road to Zhe Tree ReidgeValley.(Alfreda Murck, trans., in Images of the Mind[Princeton: The Art Museum, Princeton University, 1984], p. 226)In Xia Gui's interpretation, boldly executed brushstrokes and ink dots create an abstract language of visual signs rather than merely descriptive forms: the kinesthetic brushstrokes, which change effortlessly from outlines and foliage dots to wedge-shaped modeling strokes and ink wash, at once simplify and unify the landscape and human forms, breathing life into the moisture-drenched landscape. It was this brilliantly simplified idiom of ink wash and ax-cut brush that infused gesture with meaning, preparing the way for the expressive calligraphic revolution of the ensuing Yuan dynasty.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP154073.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36005

Four Poems in Cursive Script,Yu Youren,dateable to 1958,"Dedicated to Lin Yutang and his wife, Yu Youren here transcribes four of his own poems that allude to heroic moments in his life―his youthful aspirations, his near escape from being executed by the Manchu government, and his avid participation in the revolution that founded the Republic of China and the military campaigns for national unification. The tone of the poems also convey Yu's longing to return to China after retreating to Taiwan with the Nationalist government in 1949. The four poems read:I don't believe that youth cannot be retrieved.I will not allow our past glory to turn to ashes.Recalling the banquet in Shanghai celebrating our victory,I toast the ten thousand miles of streams and mountains with a cup of wine.Since the founding of the Republic, how the times have changed!Through those difficult years we campaigned long and hard.The founding fathers have passed away;I am an old soldier still stroking his beard.―Two poems on a photograph taken in the firstyear of the Republic [1912]Splendid streams and mountains remain the same across ten thousand miles.Let this bearded old man search everywhere for poetry.Sitting square on a rock on the beach at this moment,I watch the clouds rising from the vast ocean.―Casually sitting on the beach at Jilong [in northern Taiwan]Unable to fulfill my wish to cultivate and pasture the land,I ran for my life across the river to make history.This year [my birthday] happens to be on Labor Day.The orphan who used to make fireworks has become an old man.―A poem composed on my birthday in the thirtyfourth year of the Republic [1945](trans. by Shi-yee Liu)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-29529-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72783
Landscape,Zhao Yuan,late 14th century,"Couched in the Northern Song idioms of Yan Wengui (active ca. 970C1030) and Fan Kuan (active ca. 990C1030), this small landscape by Zhao Yuan exemplifies late Yuan and early Ming scholar painting in which ancient models were transformed by calligraphic brushwork. Late Yuan scholar-artists saw painting as a vehicle for personal expression: painting, it was said, should be like handwriting―a “heart print” of the artist.Executed during a period of political and social turmoil, Zhao’s handscroll reflects a common theme found in paintings of his time: the reclusive life. A secluded mountain villa nestled at the foot of a tall peak suggests a serene existence free from worldly strife.Zhao Yuan, who lived in the south, re-created the towering mountains of the north through his imagination.

"Poems on Paintings, Written for Ma Yueguan",Jin Nong,dated 1754,"In this album Jin Nong transcribed thirty-eight poems that he had recently composed. It begins with a set of twenty-four quatrains on the topic of earlier painters from the Tang (618C907) through the Yuan (1271C1368) period, followed by three poems on his self-portrait and others inspired by specific occasions. Jin dedicated this work to Ma Yueguan (1688C1755), a wealthy salt merchant and respected bibliophile in Yangzhou whose coterie included numerous eminent artists and scholars.First known as a talented poet and then as an eccentric calligrapher, Jin Nong had, by this time, also begun to make a name for himself as a painter. His exact, angular brushstrokes, derived from ancient inscriptions carved on stones and bronzes, mellowed slightly in his old age, as here. More than representative of Jin's late writing style, the album alludes to his attainment of the ""Three Perfections"": poetry, calligraphy, and painting.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP159146.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/51894

"Courtly Odes, Beginning with ""Wild Geese""",Ma Hezhi,mid-12th century,"In 1127 the Song northern capital was sacked by the Jurchen Jin; Emperor Huizong and members of his family were carried off, only to die later in captivity. The emperor’s ninth son, who was proclaimed Emperor Gaozong (r. 1127C62), escaped and established the Southern Song court at Lin‘an (Hangzhou) in 1138.As emperor, Gaozong sponsored a number of painting and calligraphy projects that extolled the virtues and legitimacy of his “dynastic revival.” The largest of these undertakings was illustrating the more than three hundred poems of the Classic of Poetry, a work traditionally believed to have been compiled by Confucius (551C479 B.C.). Courtly Odes, Beginning with “Wild Geese,” from the Xiaoya section of the Classic, is part of this ambitious program.The text of each poem is written in Gaozong’s regular-script style, probably by a scribe or consort. The accompanying illustrations are the work of Ma Hezhi, a court artist known for his calligrphic “orchid-leaf” brush line, which clearly derived from the scholar-painting tradition of Li Gonglin (ca. 1049C1106). Ma’s deliberately archaistic and simplified drawing style is perfectly in keeping with the great antiquity of the Classic.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP147758_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40052

"Landscapes, Figures, and Flowers",Chen Hongshou,dated 1618C22,"This exquisite album, done when Chen Hongshou was between twenty and twenty-four, exhibits a broad range of subject matter and an extraordinarily fastidious brush style that attest to his reputation as a youthful prodigy. Not long after the album was completed, the noted connoisseur and artist Chen Jiru added his critical comments opposite several of the leaves in the album, a further confirmation of Chen Hongshou's recognition among his contemporaries.In the first leaf, the bleak scene of an untended garden presents a powerful image of the decay infecting late Ming society just twentyCfive years before the dynasty was toppled by the Manchus. In his accompanying inscription Chen asks, ""Does anybody notice?"" In subsequent leaves, Chen's evocations of Li Gonglin's (ca. 1041C1106) monochrome drawing (baimiao) figural style, Ni Zan's (1306C1374) dry trees, Wang Meng's (ca. 1308C1385) cloudlike mountains, and Qian Xuan's (ca. 1235Cbefore 1307) archaic ""blue-and-green"" landscapes reveal his command of past idioms and his affinity for earlier scholar-recluse artists, while a depiction of the Solitary Elegant Peak in Guilin reveals Chen's early interest in the fantastic landscapes of the eccentric professional artist Wu Bin (ca. 1583C1626).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/1985_121_A_sf.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44759
"[Studio Portrait: Two Women Standing Beside a Table, Hong Kong]",Pun-Lun,1860sC70s,"The carte de visite, a format comprised of an approximately 2 x 4 inch photograph mounted to card stock, was perhaps the most ubiquitous of nineteenth-century photographs. The French studio portrait photographer André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri first patented the carte in 1854. His innovation of exposing not just one but eight photographic images on the same glass plate negative enabled cartes to be made cheaply and reproduced on a mass scale. During the late 1850s and throughout the latter half of the century, these economical keepsakes depicting portraits of loved ones, celebrities, monarchs, and foreign types circulated en masse and spurred a veritable ""cartomania."" Collected in albums, traded among friends, and admired in drawing rooms, cartes put photography in the hands of virtually everyone, and thus offered a means of reflecting upon one’s own social standing in an ever-expanding world.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ph/mobile-large/DP-15801-093.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/738482

The Pleasures of Fishes,Zhou Dongqing,dated 1291,"Zhou Dongqing was a friend of Wen Tianxiang (1236C1283), the famous Song loyalist and a fellow native of Jiangsi Province.

That's what fish really enjoy!"" His companion Huizi remarks, ""You're not a fish―how do you know what fish enjoy?"" Zhuangzi replies, ""You are not I, so how do you know I don't know what fish enjoy?""In the inscription at the end of the painting the artist has written:Not being fish, how do we know their happiness?But we may express our feelings in our painting.In order to probe the subtleties of the ordinary,We must describe the indescribable.Painted on paper instead of silk, the work's muted colors and flat patterns of pale inkwash evoke a mood of detachment and withdrawal, which Zhou's inscription reinforces.

The bird's pose, dramatically balanced on one leg as it prepares to take another step, may refer to a famous anecdote about the Song emperor Huizong, who chided his court painters for failing to observe that when climbing, the peacock always takes the first step with its left leg.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT3873.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36459

Landscapes,Ye Xin,dated 1652,"In this gemlike album, which chronicles the changing seasons, Ye Xin, one of the leading Nanjing painters of his day, lovingly depicts the rural scenery around his native city. A sensitive and lyrical recorder of the familiar, Ye was also an innovative experimenter with light, atmosphere, and color. His art also reflects a creative response to Western images introduced to China by Jesuits in the late sixteenth century.

"Cranes, Pine Tree, and Lichen",Ren Yi (Ren Bonian),dated 1885,"Ren Yi, the son of a rice merchant, was trained in a portrait shop. Ren developed a popular richly colored style for figures and for flower-and-bird and landscape paintings, becoming a leading artist in Shanghai by the 1870s, with a large circle of eminent friends and students, such as the literatus Wu Changshi (1844C1927).Cranes, fungus, and pine are emblems of long life, but the artistic ambition of this imposing picture, all angles and fitted parts, goes beyond that of the traditional auspicious birthday picture. The complex pictorial structure, formed by interlocking triangles, seems to draw on the relationship of figure and ground at the heart of seal carving, an art greatly appreciated in the nineteenth century. Ren also may have been inspired by the strong overlapping silhouettes on a shallow ground seen in Japanese art, particularly screens.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36425-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44566

"Lofty Scholar among Streams and Mountains, in the manner of Juran",Wang Jian,late 17th century,"The Orthodox school master Wang Jian seldom painted figures or architecture. In this painting, however, Wang, who claims in his inscription to have been inspired by a work of the same title by Juran (act. ca. 960C95), has depicted a scholar seated in a handsome two-story studio overlooking an expanse of river. The idea of a mountain retreat also recalls Wang Wei's (699C759) Wangchuan Villa.The mountain forms, made with round ""hemp-fiber"" texture strokes and rich ""alum-head"" moss dots, are characteristic of the Juran brush idiom as interpreted by the Yuan master Wu Zhen (1280C1354). By executing the round arcs of these strokes in a rhythmical manner, Wang Jian invented the undulating compositional movements that his pupil Wang Hui (1632C1717) developed into the so-called dragon-vein principle.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-752-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41484

Landscapes and trees,Gong Xian,ca. 1679,"By the mid-1670s Gong Xian’s confidence as a painter had taught him to avoid an overly skillful or popular style. He wrote:“Nowadays when people paint they do only what appeals to the common eye; I alone do not seek to please the present.”In this album, both paintings and inscriptions attest to Gong’s striving after a spiritual communion with earlier masters while creating a pictorial vocabulary all his own. Departing from his densely textured, monumental landscape style of the 1660s, Gong moved toward a sparser manner in which each brushstroke is made to function calligraphically as well as descriptively, embodying both expressive and representational meaning.

In the manner of Ming plum blossom painters, Jin washed the surface of the fan with pale silvery blue, leaving a full moon and the blossoms in reserve. The picture shimmers with moonlight, and the blossoms all bu disappear against the radiance, preserved by dark ink flecks that suggest sepals, petals and stamen.

The images range from the exuberance of lacy blossom-laden boughs to the restrained elegance of a single budding branch. There is a graphic quality to Jin Nong's compositions, achieved through a tight interlocking of painted image, calligraphy, and seals. His poetic inscriptions, written in his typically exact, vigorous manner, not only deepen the meaning of his imagery, but also act as graphic motifs that further animate each composition.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP160540.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36432

Bamboo and rock,Deng Yu,ca. 1360C67,"Deng Yu, a leading late Yuan literary Daoist, joined the Orthodox Unity sect of Daoism at the age of twelve.

The bamboo leaves are done in clerical script; the stalks, in seal script; and the rocks, drawn in mixed ink tones, simulate the ""flying-white"" style of calligraphy. A poem inscribed by Liu Renben, the governor-general of Wenzhou under the rebel leader Fang Guozhen, establishes the date of Deng's painting:After fog and rain, in Jiangnan,Few friends of integrity remain.As autumn fills the shores of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers,Clouds paint the bamboo a deep green.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT6777.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44701
Mandarin ducks and cotton rose hibiscus,Lü Ji,late 15th century,"Big, colorful, and dazzling, this painting demonstrates why Lü Ji became the most revered bird-and-flower painter at the court of the Ming emperor Hongzhi (r. 1488C1505). Hung in a palace, this work would have added a splash of pizzazz, brightening the interior space with the vitality of the natural world. Like most of Lü’s paintings, this one also has a symbolic dimension: the pair of mandarin ducks in the foreground connote a happy marriage, while the surrounding flowers form rebuses (visual puns) that underscore the message. For instance, the word for “hibiscus” (furong 芙蓉) combines with “cassia” (gui 桂) to form the rebus furong qigui 夫s妻F, meaning “prosperous groom, honorable bride”―the perfect painting to celebrate a wedding.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-16766-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39551

Poem,Fu Shan,Undated,"明/清 傅山 草七言^句 S 本This monumental work is a perfect visual encapsulation of Fu Shan’s credo: “Better awkward than clever, better ugly than charming, better fragmented than slick, better straightforward than calculating.” Works by Fu’s contemporaries Ni Yuanlu and Wang Duo also achieve the effect of intentional “ugliness,” but they do so by different means. Where Ni and Wang use quirky angles and shifts of direction, Fu uses free―seemingly uncontrollable―meandering, rounded lines. All three saturate the surface of the silk with splotches of wet ink, a bold gesture that goes against traditional ideas of beauty in calligraphy.The poem reads:Taking things easy in old age, I shun all worldly engagements,And sleep day after day behind the tightly shut doors of my rustic home.But then deep feelings stir up attachments;A red lotus blossoms in the rain.―Trans. by Shi-yee Liu",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP325242.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78835

He was less influential as a calligrapher, but he developed a charming and recognizable style that combined tall, occasionally boxy character forms with sinuous lines.

Rustic retreat among fishermen,Zhou Wenjing,15th century,"Zhou Wenjing served as a court painter in the Beijing imperial palace. His artistic abilities became known when he was summoned to court as a soothsayer and won first prize in a painting competition sponsored by the Xuande emperor (r. 1426C35). Zhou was still active as a court painter in 1463.This small hanging scroll elucidates Ming accounts describing how Zhou Wenjing followed the styles of both the Southern Song Academy master Xia Gui (act. ca. 1190C1225) and the Yuan scholar-painter Wu Zhen (1280C1354). The painting's large proportion of empty space, the intimate focus, and the use of mineral colors on silk recall the highly selective ""one-corner"" landscapes of the Song Academy. Zhou's intentionally naive rendering of figures and calligraphic treatment of foreground grasses and foliage patterning, however, are derived from scholar paintings of the late Yuan. This painting probably decorated a small panel or screen in the living quarters of the palace.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-17819-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45669
Poem on Boating on the Qinhuai River,Mei Qing,undated,"清 梅清 行秦淮舟泛 S 本As an artist, Mei Qing is best remembered for his paintings, and the dramatic variations of ink tonality in this rare, purely calligraphic work reveal a painterly sensibility. The poem, also composed by Mei, relates the delights of boating in the evening with a friend on the Qinhuai River in Nanjing and celebrates the city’s vibrant night life, as reflected in the last line: “The flute music is hard to resist when intoxicated.” The poem may have been composed in the 1680s, when Mei visited his friend, the famous monk-artist Shitao (1642C1707), in Nanjing.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/EX 2012.2.018.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78844
Three poems,Wen Peng,1556,"明 文彭 草五言三首  本Here, Wen Peng follows the style of Sun Guoting (646C691), a leading calligrapher of the Tang dynasty (618C907) who was revered for his cursive writing. By the midsixteenth century, genuine works by Sun had become scarce. Born to the eminent Wen family of Suzhou, which boasted a great art collection and access to others in the area, Wen Peng might still have had the opportunity to study original calligraphy by Sun.In this album Wen Peng transcribes three poems, presumably of his own composition, on the subjects of appreciating peach blossoms, a literary gathering in a Daoist temple, and cloudy mountains. In contrast to the monumental clerical script of the Thousand-Character Classic, these lyrical poems are written in small cursive script. The simplified forms of the characters and the freely linking brushstrokes create a sense of fluidity and animation.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/EX 2012.2.027_02_edt.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78853
The Story of Chen Zhongzi,Jin Nong,1749,"清 金r 漆  本Jin Nong’s calligraphy was inspired in part by ancient stone inscriptions, which were revered in eighteenth-century Yangzhou. As a young artist, Jin received critical acclaim for his clerical-script calligraphy. After failing the examination to enter officialdom at the age of fifty, he seems to have turned away from traditional clerical script, adapting and exaggerating elements of it to create the idiosyncratic personal style known as “lacquer script.” The transcription in this album of the story of Chen Zhongzi, a famous recluse from the fourth century B.C., is representative of Jin’s mature style. The characters are tall rather than squat; the horizontal strokes are swept onto the paper with a flattened brush tip; and the vertical strokes and left-downward diagonals turn spiky toward the ends.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/EX 2012.2.017.01_edt.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78843
Poem on a River Sojourn,Wang Duo,1645,"明 王I 行宿江上 S 本Wang Duo’s style is marked by calculated imbalances. In this scroll, he twists the right sides of his characters outward, creating a studied awkwardness that appealed to the seventeenth-century taste for the rough and bold. Some scholars link Wang’s style to the turmoil of the times, when the native Ming dynasty was conquered by invaders, known as the Manchus, who established the Qing dynasty in 1644. Wang was a high official in the Ming court, and when the dynasty fell, he followed the refugee court south to Nanjing, where it held on for another year.

Five poems on plum blossoms,Shitao (Zhu Ruoji),undated,"清 石 楷梅花五首 扇面 本Shitao created this fan as a professional artist in Yangzhou, after relinquishing Buddhist monkhood in the mid-1690s. The plainness of the paper and the choice of poems on plum blossoms suggest the work was made for a scholar. The text is written in standard script, but the flaring downward diagonal strokes reveal Shitao’s study of clerical script. Shitao’s mixing of different script types foreshadows calligraphic trends of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This fan was originally designed to be folded, but, as often happens with examples by important artists, it was later remounted as an album leaf.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/EX 2012.2.021_edt.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78847
Palace Poem by Wang Jian (d. 830?),Mi Wanzhong,undated,"明 米fR 草m~ S 本Mi Wanzhong was one of a group of prominent calligraphers of the late Ming dynasty who abandoned studious refinement in favor of bold displays of personal expression. The poem, composed by Wang Jian, a renowned Tang dynasty (618C907) poet, describes a majestic imperial ceremony. Mi transcribed the text in cursive, the most casual script, in which character forms are abbreviated and the calligrapher does not always pause to lift the brush between characters. Using cursive script allowed Mi to move quickly and decisively and to emphasize the power and energy of his movements rather than the finer points of brush and ink.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP325254.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/625126

His semicursive script, which he used for the small dedication on the left, provides the perfect counterpoint. It combines old character forms and sinuous lines into a playful and historically informed pastiche that spoke to other members of the Epigraphic School.

The Thousand-Character Classic,Wen Peng,1561,"明 文彭 `千字文  本When Wen Peng created this album in 1561, his choice of clerical script was unusual, as was the oversized scale of the characters. The text, known as the Thousand-Character Classic, was used by nearly all calligraphers to hone their skills, but it was more commonly written in semicursive, cursive, or standard script. Writing it in clerical script was a slow and laborious process, but the result is novel: a bold, muscular twist on a classic. Wen was one of the first calligraphers to look back to clerical script for inspiration. This practice became common three centuries later.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP324149.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78854

Returning Home,Shitao (Zhu Ruoji),ca. 1695,"Landscapes alternate with flowers in this album of twenty-four small leaves of paintings and poetic comments that is designed to be perused slowly, one pair of leaves at a time. Each painting and its accompanying poem were conceived as a single expressive image in a superb harmony of painting, poetry, and calligraphy. The paintings are ""written"" with the same type of brushstrokes as the calligraphy, while in the ""painterly"" calligraphy individual characters and brushstrokes in varying sizes and ink tones frequently imitate such pictorial motifs as orchid petals and leaves and misty and wavy landscape elements. Even the painter's seals are integrated into the design.Shitao (""Stone Wave""), a scion of the Ming imperial family, became a monk and a painter after the Manchu conquest of 1644.

Behind them, an assistant fans a brazier, heating water for tea. A grove of ancient trees rises around them, the foliage a blaze of autumn colors. The mountains in the distance enclose the scholars’ moment of reclusion within a safe and placid haven.

Specializing in the intimate format of the album, he often returned to a familiar set of compositional types that he varied slightly in each execution.

Birds and Narcissus,Xu Xiang,dated 1883,"Xu Xiang was first a student of Qian Huian, but later studied with Ren Yi and adopted a freer brush technique. In this fan, the easy naturalism of the pair of birds, whose white markings are used like highlights, contrasts with the rather still flower cluster frontally depicted in outline technique.

Here Fu Sheng is shown discoursing on the text with the official Shao Zuo, who was sent by the emperor. Fu Sheng’s daughter, Fu Nu, seated beside him, was a scholar in her own right and aided by translating their local dialect into one familiar to the scribe.Du Jin was trained as a scholar but became a professional painter after failing the jinshi civil-service examination. He cultivated a circle of patrons and literati friends―including the artists Tang Yin and Shen Zhou―in Beijing, where he moved, as well as in Nanjing and Suzhou. Through these contacts Du Jin played a significant role in the development of a local professional painting style in Suzhou that was basically a refined version of the high academic style of the imperial court. Although this painting no longer bears a signature, it is a classic example of Du Jin’s polished academic manner.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP274148.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39667

Album of Blossoming Plum,Li Fangying,1742,"The plum, the first flower to bloom in the spring, has long been admired by scholar-gentlemen for its fortitude in the face of harsh conditions. Its delicate blossoms, springing forth from gnarled trunks and twisted branches, are a symbol of renewal, while its fragrance carries connotations of moral purity and loyalty.Li Fangying developed a specialty for painting the blossoming plum, which he admired for its lofty symbolism and long association with scholar-painting, as well as for its viability as a vehicle for spontaneous, abbreviated brushwork and dramatic abstraction. This album, painted when Li was living at home mourning the death of his parents, exemplifies the artist's integration of poetry, painting, and calligraphy and shows off his distilled minimalism and ability to produce distinctive variations on a single theme.Born into a family of government officials in Nantong, Jiangsu Province, a district under the jurisdiction of Yangzhou, Li Fangying is traditionally identified as one of the ""Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou."" In 1729, in recognition of his father's loyal service, Li was granted an official post by the Yongzheng emperor (r. 1723C35). He held a number of posts as a magistrate in Shandong and Anhui Provinces, but his service was repeatedly interrupted due to clashes with his superiors.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP211112.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/62953
"White Crane Mountain, leaf from Album for Zhou Lianggong",Ye Xin,datable to 1654C55,"This painting and its accompanying inscription belonged to an album made for the noted Nanjing collector and high official Zhou Lianggong (1612C1672). A leading patron of contemporary artists, Zhou assembled a number of these albums during the last twenty-five years of his life, when his career required him to travel extensively. Such collaborative works have long been a means for a group of artists to commemorate special occasions, but Zhou’s albums, which sometimes encompassed hundreds of contributions, fulfilled a different function: they included works by professionals and scholar-amateurs, Ming loyalists and Qing officials, traditionalist orthodox painters and innovative individualists. By inviting a wide spectrum of artists to both view and contribute to these albums, Zhou created a unique forum for artists to learn from and appraise one another’s productions.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153914.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36090
Scholar on a rock,Ren Yi (Ren Bonian),ca. 1880,"Rendered in highly controlled contours of uniform width and geometric perfection that appear engraved rather than brushed, this fan painting is probably an early work exemplifying Ren Yi's mastery of the archaistic idiom of his fellow townsman Chen Hongshou (1598-1652), who was an important model for each of the Four Rens. Ren depicted a scholar, out for a stroll, resting on a large strangely eroded garden rock. The gentleman has propped his walking stick in a crook of the stone and become engrossed in a book. By isolating this image against a blank background, Ren focuses our attention on the subtle interplay between the scalloped contours of the rock and the patterned folds of the man's robes, conveying a sense of the deep harmony between these kindred spirits.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP161427.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39715
"Project to Extend the Great Wall of China by 10,000 Meters: Project for Extraterrestrials No. 10",Cai Guo-Qiang,1990,"This album serves as a kind of blueprint, or proposal, for Cai’s eponymous 1993 project in which he laid a ten-thousand-meter trail of gunpowder from the western end of the Great Wall into the Gobi Desert and ignited it at dusk. It opens (on the right) with the eastern end of the Great Wall at Shanhaiguan. The multiple strands of the iconic structure are evoked by dynamic ink strokes and short, crenellated segments. Burn marks at the left end suggest Cai’s method for extending the length of the Great Wall. Here, he combines the force of his own gestures with the elemental force of ignited gunpowder, juxtaposing the controlled marks of his brush with the uncontrollable action of fire. Playing with the modern myth that the Great Wall is the only man-made construction visible from outer space, Cai’s pyrotechnic display of 1993, like this album, seeks to address a universal audience.To either side of the inked line, Cai has added cursive inscriptions that offer his musings on the project.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP303899r1_66X_edt.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73660

Lyric Verse by Zhang Yu (1283C1350),Mo Shilong,1576,"明 莫是 行雨曲 S 本The fourth script type, semicursive, can be difficult to distinguish from cursive script, as they both emphasize speed and fluidity. In semicursive script, the brush is generally lifted between characters, though not always, and complex character forms are implified slightly, but less completely than in cursive. This example of semicursive text encapsulates the spirit of this script type: unhurried ease. During the late Ming dynasty (1568C1644), Mo Shilong was one of a group of artists working in Shanghai who achieved great heights of elegance in semicursive script. In this work, Mo transcribes a verse by the Yuan dynasty (1271C1368) poet, painter, and calligrapher Zhang Yu, followed by a prose inscription relating the circumstances of the work’s creation. Mo had just returned home after failing the Provincial Examination in Nanjing in the winter of 1576.

Published circa 1937, the dictionary contained neither simplified characters nor Communist-inflected rhetoric. Liu’s Dictionary, therefore, can be read as a subtle commentary on how language influences the cultural identity and personal freedom of its users.

The scroll portrays Qianlong inspecting flood-control measures along the Yellow River. He stands beside the spillway that directs the clear, blue waters of the Huai River into the silt-laden Yellow River, diluting its sediment content and helping to flush the silt out to sea. The remainder of the scroll depicts various flood-prevention techniques, including double-sluice gates to reduce the force and flow of water into the Grand Canal, pounded-earth and stone-faced levees, and large bundles of sorghum used for repairing breaches in the dikes.Painted by Xu Yang, whom Qianlong recruited for his painting academy while visiting Suzhou on his first southern tour, the scroll's ""Western-style"" unified panorama and automatically precise, theatrically posed figures reveal the influence of Giuseppe Castiglione (1688C1766) and other Jesuit artists working at the Qing court.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP105279_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49251

In his fifties, Ju Chao returned to his own villa and maintained a quiet life painting and studying Han seals.This tightly drawn depiction of silk moths and of silkworms on mulberry leaves reveals Ju Chao's playful and observant interest in unconventional subjects. He and his cousin were criticized by a contemporary Guangdong critic for choosing to paint such insignificant subjects as flies, fireflies, mosquitoes and ants.

The sweeping tendrils and crusty shell of the shrimp, the structure of the crab, and the moist flesh of the frogs poised to spring are rendered with the greatest economy of means.

In the springtime scene (right), two gentlemen on horseback cross a bridge with their servants. In the summer scene (left), travelers struggle against a strong wind, while a gentleman in a pavilion observes the storm.In his paintings Xie Shichen creates spaces that are poetic rather than representational, incorporating narrative vignettes and stylistic references to past masters.

Untitled No. 6 "Flower",Liu Wei,2003,"Liu gained prominence as a Cynical Realist figure painter in the 1990s, creating ironic, subtly morbid portrayals of political figures and military officials that reflect both his upbringing and a sense of disillusionment experienced after the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989. He later worked in a more abstract, expressive manner that incorporated landscape imagery, nudes, and writing. All of these themes come together in Liu’s Flower series, where one confronts an illogical swarm of disparate media, subjects, and styles. Painted over the landscape scenes in semiopaque colors are large-scale pink flowers, phallic forms, grotesque naked figures drawn with “hairy” modeling lines, and ambiguously irreverent references to earlier masters. Crudely written words are added as gratuitous captions or comments alongside squiggles and doodles.

Figures,Xu Cao,ca. 1938,"The 19th century interest in a dramatic figural style, cultivated by populist artists, celebrating heroes, sages and religious figures, was fueled in the 20th century by the heroics of a nation in crisis and the continuing democratization of culture.Xu Cao was a leading conservative artist in Peking in the 30s and 40s. He took his inspiration for this handscroll from a painting of Drunken Immortals by the 15th century artist Du Jin, known for his large figures, sometimes over a foot high, wielding torches, thunderbolts and the like. Some 15th century critics thought these figures ""strange indeed, lacking what is called elegant beauty."" In the Peking of the 1930s, Xu Cao's zestful brushwork and taste for theatrics exemplified in the attitudes of his figures, were conservative in their references to the past, but wholly modern in the spirit of defiance and abandon they celebrated. Among the riches of China's artistic tradition are innumerable ghosts ready to take new life in the present.Xu Cao, who served as vice-president of the Peking Painting Academy was charged as a rightist in 1957, disappeared and later died.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP204923_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49711
Landscapes and calligraphy,Gao Fenghan,dated 1736,"Passing the local-level civil-service examination in 1727, Gao Fenghan served as a petty bureaucrat in Anhui Province for about a decade. Then, in 1737, Gao not only lost his government position but his right hand suddenly became paralyzed from acute rheumatism. Painfully training himself to write and paint with his left hand, he came to prize the crude awkwardness of his left-handed brushwork―a quality he had been unable to attain with his right hand. Supporting himself through his painting, he moved to a Buddhist monastery in Yangzhou, where he became close friends with the eclectic group of artists known as the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou. In 1741 he left Yangzhou and retired to his hometown in Shandong Province.This small album, dated 1736, was done one year before Gao lost the use of his right hand. It shows the artist already working in a highly individualistic, naive style that reflects, in part, his lack of contact with ancient masterpieces. In contrast to Orthodox School painters, who drew inspiration from the works of Song and Yuan scholar-artists, Gao reveals in his inscriptions his artistic debt to near-contemporary professional painters such as Lan Ying (1585Cafter 1664), Gong Xian (1619?C1689), and Dai Benxiao (1621C1698).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP161122_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49237

Dragon Pine was painted for Zhang Yuchu, the forty-third Daoist ""pope"" of the Orthodox Unity sect, and bears his appreciative colophon.This animated pine recalls an account by the tenth-century hermit-painter Jing Hao that describes ""a gigantic pine tree, its aged bark overgrown with lichen, its winged scales seeming to ride in the air. Its stature is like that of a coiling dragon trying to reach the Milky Way."" For Jing Hao, as for later artists, the pine signified ""the moral character of the virtuous man.""

"Flowers, fish, and crabs",Liu Jie,mid-16th century,"This painting by the court master Liu Jie juxtaposes a large perch with many smaller fish and a variety of flora and fauna, including narcissus in bloom, lily pads, grasses, grain, a crab, and frogs. The effect is one of civilized tranquility in which the large fish, symbolizing a person of obvious stature, swims quietly along a peaceful riverbank. Both the fish and grain symbolize wealth, and the overall impact of the image is suggestive of abundance and reward. Some pictorial elements―perch, grain, and crab―also create a visual pun with a homophonous wish for “peace and harmony in the entire palace,” which makes it clear that this picture was intended for the emperor.Liu Jie’s formal signature, which gives his title as Commander in the Embroidered Uniform Guard, on Appointment to the Wenhua Palace, confirms that this was an imperial commission. The Wenhua Palace was one of the halls in the Forbidden City at which court painters served. Liu’s rank of commander was very near the highest to which a painter could aspire. Both Liu’s grandfather and father had also held this title as court artists, and Liu Jie would have been entitled to inherit this rank after his father’s death, which apparently occurred only a few years after Liu received his first court title in 1477.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-19134-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45670

Landscapes,Zhang Feng,dated 1644,"Following the fall of Beijing to the bandit-rebel Li Zicheng in April 1644, Nanjing suffered a chaotic year of warfare between a Ming loyalist regime and the attacking Manchu forces. This album was painted in August 1644 as the Ming dynasty was crumbling.In creating these idyllic images of the world of the recluse, Zhang Feng turned to the pale dry style of Ni Zan (1306C1374), but the gossamer lightness of Zhang's touch adds a new lyrical charm to Ni's style. Keenly interested in language, Zhang explores the expressive interplay of visual and poetic imagery in fresh and insightful ways: one leaf describes the murmur of pines and the sound of water running over rocks; another evokes the echoes of a stone tossed into a deserted valley; a third features a sunset, a subject rarely depicted by scholar-artists but one that may have held deep symbolic meaning for Zhang. He remained loyal to the Ming dynasty after the Manchu conquest and, refusing to take an official position under the new regime, ended his life in poverty.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP162771.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36436

Spring Landscape,Gong Xian,dated 1671,"Gong Xian was interested in art theories and methods. He composed a few illustrated books for students of painting with practical instructions on structure and brushwork. He singled out stability (an) and strangeness (qi) as key to landscape composition by stating, “If a composition has no strangeness, there is no value in its stability. Stability without strangeness is the work of a commonplace hand; strangeness without stability, of an immature hand.” An ideal painting, such as this landscape, should have strange imagery to stimulate the viewer’s imagination beyond the mundane world yet be convincing enough to stir his yearning for accessibility.Gong complements this evocative landscape of bizarre rock masses and empty dwellings under lush trees with a melancholy poem:Green willows, fresh cattails, an expanse of water inthe wilderness;Reflections of red balustrades around the pavilionsof private homes.Having seen the spring off, I still call for wine,In a rainy chill that the setting sun cannot dispel.cat. no. 54",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_54.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76527
Vista into the Distance,Zha Shibiao,dated 1675,"Zha Shibiao, an Anhui native, was descended from a family with a sizable collection of antiquities, including Song and Yuan paintings. Uninterested in civil service, he supported himself through painting and calligraphy while traveling in the lower Yangzi region before settling down in Yangzhou by the late 1660s.Early exposure to a broad range of painting models enabled Zha to break free of the stylistic dominance of Hongren (1610C1664), with whom he was personally acquainted. Here, Zha evokes the exquisite simplicity of Hongren’s principal model, Ni Zan (1306C1374). Adopting Ni’s typical composition―a wide river separating foreground trees from distant mountains―Zha’s addition of rich vegetation and a human figure transforms Ni’s austere style, creating an inviting environment for reclusion as described in Zha’s poetic inscription.cat. no. 48",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_48.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76521

Mending clothes by daylight,Unidentified artist,calligraphy datable to 1240s,"Chan doctrine teaches that all images are illusory, and paintings such as this one, in which ink is applied so lightly that the picture seems to flicker and fade before the viewer’s eyes, are among the most eloquent artistic manifestations of that belief. Using dilute ink for most of the picture, the artist has reserved dark tones for the eyes of the main figure and the needle in his hand, imparting special emphasis to these key elements.

Portrait of Huang Jianyuan (1844C1911),Ding Shangyong,"undated, late nineteenth century","A gentleman in a robe of blue silk gazes out at the viewer, a yellow chrysanthemum clutched delicately in his left hand. In the foreground, a plant of blossoming chrysanthemum clusters next to a gnarled rock, while in the background more flowers grow at the base of a parasol tree, which arcs gently above the scholar, framing him in the center of the picture. The subject is Huang Jianyuan (1844C1911), a late Qing scholar-official. The painter of the portrait itself did not sign the work; the inscription is by Huang’s friend Ding Shangyong (active late 19th century), a scholar-official and painter who added the landscape background.

Poem in Cursive Script,Huang Daozhou,17th century,"One of the most outspoken officials in the late Ming period, Huang Daozhou persistently risked his life and career by criticizing court authorities. After the Manchu conquest of north China, he was active in the revivalist movement under the Southern Ming regime and died a martyr.Huang was an eminent scholar on a variety of subjects, from Neo-Confucianism to astronomy. Although he considered calligraphy a mere pastime, his accomplishment is no less impressive. In this work of running-cursive script, he altered the standard configuration of characters to create precariously balanced forms that often rely on a calculated final stroke to adjust their proportion and center of gravity. The sharp, fastmoving brushwork generates a rhythmic cadence of pent-up energy and release.Huang composed this poem during an outing to the mountains by West Lake, in Hangzhou, in the winter of 1638. In it he laments the physical frailty of old age and expresses his longing for a life in reclusion. Among his companions on this trip was Ni Yuanlu (1593C1644).cat. no. 9",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_09.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76482
Landscapes in the style of Ni Zan,Dai Benxiao,17th century,"Witnessing his father’s death after a failed attempt to resist the Manchus, Dai Benxiao harbored strong loyalist sentiments well into adulthood. His spare painting, constructed with dry contours and minimal shading, evokes a cool otherworldliness that suggests emotional detachment in the wake of dynastic and family tragedy.According to Dai’s inscription, this painting is a copy from memory of a landscape by the recluse-artist Ni Zan (1306C1374). Ni typically reduces nature to its barest essentials in calligraphic brushstrokes, an aesthetic that Dai adapted here into complex rock formations rendered in the “dry-brush” style. In his inscription he compares this work to a set of ten paintings by Ni that celebrate the exuberance of nature through dense compositions and vigorous brush idioms. Emphasizing the dynamic aspect of Ni’s art, he suspected most of the overly sketchy works attributed to Ni to be forgeries.cat. no. 57",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_57.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76530
Orchids and Rock,Xu Fang,dated 1693,"A native of Suzhou, Xu Fang passed the provincial-level civil-service examination in 1642. After his father committed suicide to protest Manchu rule, Xu gave up his pursuit of public office and spent the rest of his life in self-exile on a mountain outside Suzhou.This painting of wild orchids, fungi, and a rock can be considered a symbolic self-portrait of the artist. Orchids thrive in the wilderness, unconcerned with the bustling world that ignores their fragrance. Time may carve into the rock’s surface and chisel away its edges but cannot compromise its essential substance. Painted in late winter one year before he died, the robust fungi, treasured for their association with longevity, tell of the old man’s high spirits and optimism.cat. no. 58",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_58.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76531
Streams and Mountains without End,Zhao Zuo,dated 1611C12,"A close friend and follower of Dong Qichang (1555C1636), Zhao Zuo is said to have served occasionally as Dong's ""substitute brush,"" or ghost painter. In this scroll, however, Zhao has followed the manner of the Yuan master Huang Gongwang (1269C1354) to create a lyrically realistic landscape in which Dong Qichang's influence is tempered by the deft use of rich washes and color. Abstract mountain forms, no doubt inspired by Dong, are softened by the painter's skillful evocation of spatial recession and hazy atmosphere.

Writing the “Orchid Pavilion Preface” One Thousand Times,Qiu Zhijie,1990C95,"This photographic documentation of Qiu’s best-known, process-driven work exemplifies his early interest in the performative aspect of calligraphy, particularly the pedagogical method of repeatedly copying a model until its brush movements become second nature. The “Orchid Pavilion Preface,” written by the patriarch of calligraphy Wang Xizhi (303C61), has long been revered as the unsurpassed model of cursive writing. Repeatedly writing over his free-hand interpretation of the original, Qiu turns the paper into a saturated black field.

"Mountain Retreat,  leaf from Album for Zhou Lianggong",Shi Lin,datable to 1654C55,"This painting and its accompanying inscription belonged to an album made for the noted Nanjing collector and high official Zhou Lianggong (1612C1672). A leading patron of contemporary artists, Zhou assembled a number of these albums during the last twenty-five years of his life, when his career required him to travel extensively. Such collaborative works have long been a means for a group of artists to commemorate special occasions, but Zhou’s albums, which sometimes encompassed hundreds of contributions, fulfilled a different function: they included works by professionals and scholar-amateurs, Ming loyalists and Qing officials, traditionalist orthodox painters and innovative individualists.

Qin,Prince Lu,1634,"Many Ming-dynasty princes, starting with the sons of the founder and continuing until the last generation before the dynasty's fall in the mid-seventeenth century, were accomplished musicians, and some made important contributions to musicology and musical theory. The first prince of Lu (1568C1614), brother of Emperor Shenzhong (Wanli), was an immensely rich man, and hundreds of qin were made for his household and descendants in the last years of the Ming dynasty. All bear the inscription of the Princedom of Lu, and all are numbered. About ten Prince Lu qin are extant; the one in the Metropolitan Museum, number 18, dated 1634, is the earliest. The highest-numbered Prince Lu qin known is number 295. It is dated 1644, the year the Ming dynasty came to an end.The back of the Metropolitan's qin bears the maker's seal and date, the words ""Capital Peace,"" and a twenty-character poem by Jingyi Zhuren (d. 1670) that reads:The moonlight is being reflected by the river YangziA light breeze is blowing over clear dewdrops,Only in a tranquil placeCan one comprehend the feeling of eternity.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP302703.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/56553

Mi Fu Bowing to a Stone,Pu Ru,20th century,"The world changed around Pu Ru,brother of the last emperor of China, Pu Yi, and the most talented painter among the princes of the Qing royal family,but his values remained constant. In his painting of Mi Fu (1052C1107), the Northern Song poet, politician, painter, and connoisseur, Pu pays homage to the enduring culture of China's lettered gentlemen. The magistrate Mi Fu was known as much for his outspokenness as for his refined tastes. Pu's painting recalls Mi's visit to the garden of the governor of Wuwei (present-day Anhui), where he saw a stone of uncommon presence and wonder. To pay his respects, Mi dressed in official robes, carried his hu (an official tablet used to ensure that a lesser man's breath never fell upon the emperor), and addressed the stone as ""Elder Brother Rock."" Others found this laughable, but Mi answered that he bowed to the stone; he did not worship it.In Pu Ru's painting, we see Mi Fu bowing, but there is no stone. With the classic means of the literati repertory,restraint and omission,Pu Ru evokes complex resonances. Garden stones were prized as human character was prized. Their idiosyncratic features were admired, their companionship was valued, and their challenge to the viewer's imagination was esteemed. Pu's painting clearly intimates that the beauty and stature of such stones exist primarily in the mind of the beholder and that these qualities might be preserved there, even after the stone,like the Qing dynasty,has vanished.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP162668.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41501
Remonstrating with the emperor,Liu Jun,late 15thCearly 16th century,"Depicting a loyal official remonstrating with the emperor, this painting was commissioned to enhance the image of the sovereign as a just ruler who welcomed frank criticism and encouraged honest admonitions from his officials. The reality was often quite the opposite.Bearing the signature of Liu Jun, a court painter who eventually attained the honorary rank of Commander in Chief of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, this large colorful hanging scroll testifies to the continuation of the Song academic tradition of narrative art under the sponsorship of the Ming court. But while both the subject matter and figure style are based on Song models, Remonstrating with the Emperor exhibits a compositional density and schematization that typify works of the Ming academy at the end of the fifteenth century. Song court paintings emphasize narrative content and the creation of a believable spatial framework for the action; Ming paintings emphasize symbolic content. Liu Jun's main objective is no longer the recounting of a specific story or the achievement of an accurate description of nature; rather, it is the communication of a message through a vocabulary of images imbued with symbolic meaning.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-19328-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39552

Also, the artist’s inscription mentions the sixteenth-century collector Xiang Yuanbian, so it was obviously not intended to be a forgery of the fifteenth-century Li Zai, but the possibility of another painter by that name from the same hometown is unlikely.

Lotus,Chen Hengke,early 20th century,"Chen Hengke's masterpiece of design demonstrates the shift in the modern period away from calligraphic to graphic principles. Chen's painting frankly recalls Wu Changshi's numerous renderings of this subject, but strays from the firm, round brushwork that was the underpinning of Wu's work. Chen's dramatic composition groups the contrasting shapes into right angles along two edges of the picture, creating a tension that makes the unused space come alive. Trained in calligraphy since his youth and something of a prodigy, Chen demonstrates in his inscription the power of his calligraphic line to activate a three-dimensional space.

On the Seventeenth Day,Wang Xizhi,13th century rubbing of a 4th century text,"Most personal correspondence was written in an informal form of clerical script known as cursive clerical (caoli) or draft cursive (zhangcao). In this script type, which originated as an abbreviated form of writing used in drafting manuscripts, individual characters are simplified, with some brushstrokes omitted and others linked in fluid, continuous lines. By the fourth century, such informal writings by known authors, originally viewed as a heterodox debasement of the orthodox clerical manner, became cherished for their expressive individuality.Original manuscripts by the ""calligraphy sage"" Wang Xizhi and other early masters were already rare in the early Tang dynasty (618-907), when a major effort to collect and authenticate Wang's writings was sponsored by the imperial court. To preserve and propagate these precious writing models, precise tracings were made, as were stone or wood-carved reproductions. Rubbings taken from the carved reproductions provided the principal means for students to acquire and study classical models.On the Seventeenth Day is a selection of twenty-nine letters written by Wang Xizhi collected under the sponsorship of the Tang emperor Taizong (r. 627-49), a devoted student of Wang's writing style and the compiler of a comprehensive collection of Wang's surviving works. The title derives from the initial characters of the first letter. Extant rubbings of the manuscript date to the Song dynasty (960-1279) or later and vary tremendously in quality. The Song rubbings, of which several versions are known, were based in turn on Tang tracings or rubbings. The dominant type, such as this example, ends with the large imperial cipher qi (""imperial order"") followed by a brief inscription stating that the emperor ordered the copy carved on stone as the official version of the Hongwen Academy.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP363562_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39899

This album is a collection of letters written by the great painter and calligrapher Zhu Da to his close friend Fang Shiguan (1650Cca. 1711).

In the first half of the painting, the horses and figures are well drawn and there is a rough vigor in the depiction of the landscape and trees. The shading of the land forms and the bold modulated outlines defining the figures, who wear typical Khitan costumes, most closely resemble murals done in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in north China, then ruled by the Khitan Liao dynasty (907C1125).

Crane in a bamboo grove,Unidentified artist,14thCearly 15th century,"A favorite image in Chinese society and a familiar presence in imperial gardens as well as refined scholarly retreats, cranes were also renowned as the vehicles of Daoist immortals. Their long life span and loyalty to a single mate made them symbols of longevity and faithfulness. Here, a Manchurian crane, identified by its distinctive red forehead, strolls through a corner of the palace garden. Stopping in midstride and turning its head, the bird has just been startled by a branch of bamboo that has brushed against its tail feathers.One of only a handful of such large-scale images of birds to survive from the late Yuan or early Ming dynasty, this painting derives its subject from a composition by the emperor Huizong (r. 1100C25), who painted a set of six cranes in different poses. The complex branch structure of the twisting bamboo and the intricate detail of the bird's plumage―with every filament of the feathers carefully delineated―reveal a level of naturalistic description that predates the more conventionalized images of cranes created by the Ming court painter Bian Wenjin (ca. 1354C1428).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP235494.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39993

As is typical of a formal epitaph, the text tells the life stories of the deceased and extols their virtues in highly stylized language.

These changes incidentally meant that calligraphers could inject more individuality into their writing.

Couplet,Yi Bingshou,1815,"清朝 伊秉R 行 β 本During the Qing dynasty (1644C1911), pairs of hanging scrolls known as couplets (duilian) became popular as gifts. They were intended for public display, often during seasonal holidays, weddings, and other auspicious occasions. The rules for couplets are strict: only two lines of poetry could be presented, one on each scroll, and there had to be many parallel structures between the two. Here, using lines from two poems of the Tang dynasty (617C906), Yi Bingshou has created an example of “gathered verses,” in which lines from older poems are joined into new combinations. The couplet reads:Right: Deep colors penetrate heaven, two thousand feetin height!Left: Beautiful flowers emerge from earth, and climb twoflights of stairs.The highly original style of Yi’s semicursive script was also the result of a thoughtful combination. Some of the character structures are taken from clerical script, while the fluidity of the writing is due to a semicursive approach.

Couplet,Zhao Zhiqian,1870,"清 w之t 篆 β 本One of Zhao Zhiqian’s great accomplishments was the revival of seal script, an ancient script that served as China’s main form of writing from around 1200 B.C to 200 B.C. Seal script is onerous to write: it requires the calligrapher to move slowly and maintain a regular line width while making tortuous turns of the brush. This is why it was abandoned in favor of faster forms of writing and, in part, why it was so attractive to calligraphers like Zhao, who enjoyed the challenge posed by this old-fashioned way of writing. Zhao’s sinuous line is inspired by ancient seal script, but, here, his calligraphy is a creative interpretation that combines elements of other scripts, such as strokes that flare or taper toward the end.The text (translated and transcribed in standard script below) is a poem composed from two separate works by Gong Zizhen (1792C1841).Right: Do not rashly claim the prestige that Xie [An (320C385)] had in his time.Left: Just set your own fashion, and do not be a teacher of it.e有狂言xr望但_L獠",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/EX 2012.2.039.1-2_edt.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78866

Photography was introduced into China at mid-century, and by the 1880s photographic images were readily available in Shanghai in popular weekly magazines.He Weipu’s velvety ink textures are built with the traditional vocabulary of brushstrokes and layered ink wash, but in places these are arranged to imitate the crosshatching of Western draftsmanship.He Weipu was the grandson of the 19th century and calligrapher and official He Shaozhi (1799C1873)",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP162554_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49613

The painting recalls Mi's appointment to the post of magistrate in the district of Wuwei (present-day Anhui).

He had been trained in a portrait shop to paint the realistic ancestor images much in demand, but the majority of his paintings give little evidence of traditional training.

In one of the most celebrated acts of filial piety in history, he set out in 1652 from his home in Suzhou and returned with them after one and a half years, covering more than 1,400 miles in the round-trip journey.Travel-related imagery had been a feature of Suzhou painting since the late fifteenth century. Huangcreated several works to document his grueling experience in both the handscroll and album formats. The paintings illustrate actual sites across the spectacular but treacherous terrains through which he struggled. On each leaf, he inscribes a short text about the topography, history, and customs of the depicted site. Huang’s dramatically exaggerated scenery may nonetheless be based on preliminary sketches recording his direct observations.

Character Image of Black Character Font,Wu Shanzhuan,1989,"From the mid-1980s, Wu began to play with the visual language of the Cultural Revolution (1966C76), coopting and tweaking the red, white, and black graphical style of the big-character posters that defined that era. Where those posters strove for maximum legibility, Wu undermines understanding at every turn. Four of the six images exhibited here are legible―“yes, this, crowd, yet” (是,此,丛,而)―while the characters in the other two images have been effaced or torn.

Mythos of Lost Dynasties Series―Negative and Positive Characters,Gu Wenda,1984C85,"Each of these three hanging scrolls is inscribed with the characters zheng 正 and fan 反. When juxtaposed, the words can mean ""correct” and “contrary,” “proper” and “improper,” “front” and “back,” “orthodox” and “unorthodox,” thus calling into question what is correct or incorrect in art or in social behavior. In all three scrolls the two characters are written one above another, starkly silhouetted in black ink against a white ground. Gu uses a variety of techniques to undermine their graphic and lexical force, including writing them backward, literally contradicting their semantic sense. The characters in the flanking scrolls are also partially obscured by dark forms that resemble standing figures. As is the case with many of Gu’s works created around the mid-1980s, conceptual interrogations of the written word are often tied to social critique.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/gu-wenda-negative-positive-comp.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/77538
Crying Landscape,Yang Jiechang,2002,"In Crying Landscape, Yang deploys the antique “blue-and-green” painting style on a grand scale to depict iconic man-made structures that connote political, industrial, or military power. The triptychs were first displayed at the 2003 Venice Biennale, where they were hung from the ceiling and accompanied by a soundtrack of Johan Strauss II’s The Blue Danube waltz punctuated by the sound of the artist’s screams. Arranged in the same order here, the sequence showcases the Houses of Parliament, an oil refinery, the great dam at the mouth of the Yangzi Gorges, the Pentagon under terrorist attack, and a Las Vegas simulacrum of New York. Yang, who witnessed the enormous suffering brought about by Mao’s utopian vision of socialism, here undermines the promise of stability, prosperity, and security symbolized by these iconic buildings.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP299225_edt.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78242
"Project to Extend the Great Wall of China by 10,000 Meters: Project for Extraterrestrials No. 10",Cai Guo-Qiang,1994,"In this ambitious pyrotechnic display, the artist has appropriated the Great Wall as a piece of Land Art, revitalizing one of China’s most enduring cultural icons by tapping into its perceived cosmic energy. For this work, Cai and a team of volunteers laid a ten-kilometer fuse across the barren ridges of the Gobi Desert, starting at the westernmost end of the Ming dynasty (1368C1644) wall at Jiayuguan, Gansu Province. Small charges were placed along the line at three-meter intervals, while larger charges were set at every kilometer. The fuse was ignited at dusk on February 27, 1993. The initial explosion took fifteen minutes to travel the entire length of the line and was seen by forty thousand residents and tourists. For Cai, this collective effort also subverted the Great Wall’s “original practice and ideological function.”",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/IA_079.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78027

Among his earliest works are these three scrolls, part of an original pentad that feature characters hovering over or within surreal “splashed ink” landscapes. The central scroll, with its single invented ideograph suspended over a landscape, established the pattern for most of Gu’s later works in the Mythos of Lost Dynasties series. The full ideograph is unreadable, but the three cursive-script components (易, 申, 示) may be interpreted as the character for “unobstructed” (chang畅 畅) and that for “spirit” (shen 神).

Map of the Grand Canal from Beijing to the Yangzi River,Unidentified artist,late 18th or early 19th century,"Managing China's complex network of rivers, canals, and irrigation systems has been one of the abiding concerns of its rulers. From the fourteenth century, the Grand Canal served as the major artery for transporting grain from the wealthy agricultural regions south of the Yangzi River to the capital city of Beijing in the north. Of equal importance was the constant threat of flooding from the Yellow River and other river systems that traversed the canal. Under the Manchu Qing dynasty (1644C1911), both the Kangxi (r. 1662C1722) and Qianlong (r. 1736C95) emperors personally inspected the hydraulic management measures in this region on their periodic tours of the empire.This map follows the course of the Grand Canal from the vicinity of Beijing southward to the Yangzi River. Artistically, it stands halfway between modern cartographic records and the more pictorial approach to mapmaking that was commonly used prior to the twentieth century in China. While most elements are schematically rendered, images of the Forbidden City, the Yangzi River, and certain mountains and topographic features are treated in pictorial terms. All of the rivers, canals, dams, sluice gates, dikes, and catchment basins as well as the walled cities and important towns situated near the canal are depicted and labeled. The linchpin of the entire hydraulic system was the confluence of the Yellow and Huai Rivers with the Grand Canal. Based on documented changes to the configuration of the Huang-Huai confluence and other areas, the content of the map can be dated to the period from 1737 to 1761.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP142632.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/72326
Returning Fisherman in Misty Rain,Zhang Feng,dated 1656,"A native of Nanjing, Zhang Feng was known for his poetry, painting, and seal carving. Without formal training, he created a strongly linear style in his landscapes that suggests the influence of Anhui School painters active in Nanjing. Here, linear forms modeled with touches of light ink wash generate a rhythmic momentum across the composition. The pervasive mist endows the sensitively rendered landscape elements with an inviting lyricism. His inscription reads:Dark clouds over the cliffs linger into daytime;Light mist mixed with drizzles obscures the green moss.In a straw cape and bamboo hat, a man holds a long rodby the river,While white egrets fly back and forth searching for fish.An old friend of the artist added an inscription in the upper left corner in 1683.cat. no. 47",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_47.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76520

He painted this album near Nanjing in the ninth lunar month of 1645, shortly after the city’s fall to Manchu forces. Although only the first leaf is identified as a depiction of Nanjing’s famous Mount Qixia, the other pictures could also be evocations of local sites in different seasons.These twelve landscapes juxtapose the distinct local styles of Anhui and Nanjing, sometimes a jarring blend in a single painting. Xiao’s Anhui landscapes feature massive mountains reduced to geometric formations. Here, that style’s inherent coolness and abstraction is tempered by a lush blue and green palette, naturalistic landscape elements, and signs of human habitation―all traits that reflect the Nanjing painters’ interest in local topography and genre details.cat. no. 18",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_18_c_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76491

Landscapes of the Four Seasons,Lan Ying,dated 1650,"A professional painter with a successful career in Hangzhou, Lan Ying was acquainted with several members of the educated elite and acquired enough of their aesthetics to have devoted most of his creative energy to painting in scholarly idioms. In this spectacular set of seasonal landscapes, each scroll evokes the style of a different ancient master.The accuracy of Lan’s interpretations is sometimes hard to discern. More compelling and consistent are his own technical virtuosity and predilection for dramatic compositional effects. Foreground trees are always superb manifestations of his painterly craft.

Li, together with his better-known contemporary Yuan Jiang (act. 1680C1730), worked in a studio of painters that specialized in intricately described visions of palatial architecture set within sumptuous blue-and-green landscapes.

The Daoist Immortal Han Xiangzi,Liu Jun,"undated, late 15thCearly 16th century","This painting by the Ming court artist Liu Jun depicts the Daoist immortal Han Xiangzi miraculously treading the surface of a turbulent sea. Unperturbed by the roiling waves beneath his feet or the wind that pulls at his garments, Han casually puts a bamboo flute to his lips to play a tune. His eccentrically rustic clothes mark him as a transcendent being: he wears a rustic cape of sawtoothed leaves and curly vegetal tendrils. Over his pants hangs a skirt of reeds. Over his shoulder hangs a satchel lined with animal fur, and his belt holds two dried gourds―the traditional vessel of magical Daoist elixirs.The waves at the immortal’s feet are described with a striking geometric pattern of modulated lines interspersed with corresponding sections of reserved silk. Bold patches of blank silk have been left in reserve across the painting’s middle to indicate numinous mist that accompanies the immortal on his magical journey. Along the painting’s top edge are quickly drawn lines of monochrome ink and a large patch of ink wash, a terse indication of a towering mountain landscape that lies beyond the seething ocean.Liu Jun employed a range of different brush modes in depicting Han Xiangzi, showcasing the technical virtuosity that was expected of a Ming court artist. The immortal’s face is depicted through a combination of gently graded washes of pigment with confidently drawn lines of ink and cinnabar. The hair and beard consist of two different weights of lines combined with a wash to impart a sense of hairy tactility. The large relative scale of the figure, combined with the delicate brushwork of the sensitively rendered face, creates a naturalistic effect similar to portraiture. By contrast, the bravura brushwork of the robes is self-consciously performative, meant to be read as a display of the painter’s daring technical virtuosity. The bold painterly quality of the robes’ contours is intended to contrast with the naturalism of the face, heightening the illusion of the likeness.Little is known about the life of Liu Jun, but his surviving paintings, along with fragmentary textual evidence, demonstrate that he was a gifted painter of figures, landscapes, and architecture who served the Ming court in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Daoist immortals most commonly appear in Chinese mythology as a group of eight―a ragtag band of merry, numinous eccentrics, each featuring his own special attribute―and this painting almost certainly originally belonged to a set of eight that was meant to be displayed together.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-2016_238-BT-2017.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/712098

Palace banquet,Unidentified artist,未知年代,"This large painting is one of the earliest surviving examples of the “ruled-line” (jiehua) genre of architectural renderings. It offers an intimate view of the women’s quarters of a palace where elegant rooms face onto private courtyards graced with trees and blossoming lotus, an indication of the summer season. Activity centers around a second-story terrace where women at a banqueting table point skyward or concentrate on threading needles. On the seventh day of the seventh month, women traditionally decorated their homes, set out fruits, and competed in threading needles as part of the festivities celebrating the one night each year when the Herd Boy and the Weaving Maid, legendary lovers immortalized as constellations, are allowed to meet. Behind the banquet, a woman knocks at a gate, beyond which, to the left, another woman claps her hands beside a bed to awaken its occupant. A third woman, to the right, gazes out beneath two trees that have grown intertwined―a symbol, perhaps, of the fateful union about to occur. At the upper right, two women prepare to open the gate to a visitor.The painting alludes to the love affair between the Tang emperor Xuanzong (r. 712C56) and his consort, Yang Guifei, who famously slept all day to arise refreshed at night. In 755, a rebellion broke out as a consequence of the emperor’s inattention to rulership. Xuanzong was forced to flee, and the palace guards blamed Yang Guifei for the insurrection. They forced the emperor to execute her before escorting him to safety. Bai Juyi’s (772C846) epic poem, The Song of Everlasting Sorrow, describes the tragic story, beginning with the fateful tryst alluded to by the painting. Both poem and painting may be read as admonitions against neglecting state affairs.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-13657-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39543

Scenery of the Yellow Mountains (Huangshan),Xuezhuang,late 17thCearly 18th century,"A monk from Huai'an, Jiangsu Province, Xuezhuang spent many years wandering from temple to temple before settling in 1689 in the remote peaks of Mount Huang, in southern Anhui Province. Although he lived in seclusion, his reputation for high-minded eremitism attracted travelers who sought him out to discuss Chan (Zen in Japanese) Buddhism and to admire his music, poetry, and paintings.This album of highly personal, topographic images, executed in delicate, dry brushwork, emphasizes how natural rock formations often resemble human or animal figures. The paintings are further embellished with poetry and prose notations by the artist, in which he identifies peaks that had either Buddhist or personal associations. Not only were such paintings products of scholarly practice but they could also function as souvenirs for those who made the arduous climb to Mount Huang or as a visual evocation of the mountain for those unable to travel.Beginning in the late sixteenth century, the area around Mount Huang grew prosperous thanks to the wealth of Anhui merchant networks and to such indigenous products as ink, paper, and woodblockprinted books. As local artists celebrated the scenic wonders of their home region, Mount Huang became a sightseeing destination.

Landscapes,Xiao Yuncong,dated 1668,"Xiao Yuncong was born into a gentry family in the town of Wuhu, Anhui Province, but for most of his career he resided in Nanjing, only fifty-five miles downriver. Between 1636 and 1642 Xiao and his two younger brothers prepared for the provincial-level civil-service examinations in Nanjing, where they also became political activists, joining the Fushe “Revival Society,” which sought to revive antique moral standards as a remedy for government factionalism and corruption. The fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644 ended Xiao’s government ambitions. Unwilling to serve under the Manchus, Xiao supported himself as a painter.The present album, executed when Xiao was seventy-two, exemplifies his painterly abilities at their peak. Xiao expertly applied delicate colored washes and monochrome texturing to model landscape forms and suggest the veiling effects of atmosphere. Although Xiao’s images allude to antique models of the Song and Yuan dynasties, these gemlike miniatures recall nothing so much as the lyrical representations of landscape created by the contemporary professional masters of Nanjing.Artist's inscription:In his inscription, Xiao rejects the emphasis on abstract expressive brushwork championed by Yuan dynasty (1279C1368) scholar-artists in favor of the “old methods,” by which he presumably means the more descriptive techniques of the Song dynasty (960C1279) masters.When the ancients made paintings, they were not afraid of being extremely meticulous. I once saw Mojie’s [Wang Wei, 699C759] Wangchuan Villa; it was so intricately done that it looked as if it had been engraved. From Yuan times on, artists have emphasized [the expressive qualities of] spirit resonance and plain sparseness, and the archaic methods were gradually eclipsed. The brushwork of these eight small scenes is slight and scattered. If it had been more coherent, then [these paintings] would not lack the impact of “a thousand miles [of scenery] in a few inches [of paper].”Cangya, fellowship leader and colleague, has a profound grasp of the Six Methods [of painting] and will certainly understand these words.In the fifth lunar month, the summer of the wushen year [June 9CJuly 8, 1668], XiaoYuncong",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP164311.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/65555

Palaces among Autumn Mountains,Unidentified artist,未知年代,"During the Yuan dynasty, the archaic blue-and-green landscape style was revived by scholar-artists in the south, who sought new modes of self-expression through a conscious return to models of the past. The rich mineral pigments that characterize this style also made it a favorite of professional and court painters, who never entirely stopped producing decorative works in this manner.This fan painting and its mate, Village and Temples in Jiangnan, typify late fourteenth- and early fifteenth-century interpretations of this decorative style. The prominent use of “hemp-fiber wrinkles” to texture rock surfaces reflects the late Yuan preference for the brush idiom of Dong Yuan (active 930sC960s) and Juran (active 960C95); the complex composition and confident rendering of three-dimensional forms in space closely parallel the landscape murals (dated 1358) at the Yonglegong temple.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153536.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45664

Landscape,Bada Shanren (Zhu Da),datable to 1698,"Bada Shanren rarely painted landscapes until he was nearly seventy years old, but as this album attests, he became a great master in this genre during the last decade of his life. These remarkably varied compositions reveal extraordinary sensitivity to the graphic function of negative space. Rocks are often modeled in faceted planes, while the expressive rendering of intersecting trees reveal the artist’s calligraphic sophistication.Bada’s primary inspiration for his landscapes was the late Ming master Dong Qichang (1555C1636). But this album also attests to his profound understanding of earlier masters and his bold departures from them. In his inscription on the last leaf, he not only sums up his artistic heritage but also echoes a Yuan master’s anguish over the demise of his native dynasty:Rocks textured in Guo’s [Guo Xi, ca. 1000Cca. 1090] method are topped with small clouds; Old Dong’s [Dong Yuan, active 930sC60s] hemp-fiber-like brushlines often model trees as well. I can imagine how his contemporaries interpreted his paintings: Yifeng [Huang Gongwang, 1269C1354] was still depicting the landscape of the Song empire.cat. no. 62",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_62_a.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76535
Paintings on Miscellaneous Subjects,Chen Zi,17th or 18th century,"A native from Zhuji, in northern Zhejiang, Chen Zi survived extreme hardship in childhood during the early years of the Manchu conquest. As a professional artist, however, his works reflect little anguish over the dynastic change.In both painting and calligraphy, Chen Zi followed the style of his illustrious father, the highly influential artist Chen Hongshou (1599C1652). Although the son tended to reduce the father’s archaic mannerisms into hardened conventions, he was no less versatile or experimental. This album, which covers the genres of landscape, human figure, flower-and-bird, and animal painting, demonstrates the range of his talents. The landscapes are intended to exemplify the contrasting ""dry” and “wet” modes. Finely outlined flowers are juxtaposed with leaves rendered in graded ink washes in the “boneless” manner. The gaunt monk distracted by a strange animal may allude to a folk- or Buddhist tale.cat. no. 71",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/CLL_71_a.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76544

Daoist immortals in a landscape,Unidentified artist,16th century,"This painting invites the viewer to follow a mountain path across a stone arch and into a magical realm where herb gatherers dressed in garments of leaves and grass mingle with robed gentlemen engaged in scholarly pleasures: viewing paintings, playing weiqi (go, in Japanese), strumming a zither, composing poetry, engaging in ""pure conversation,"" and contemplating the scenery. The scroll ends with an imposing terrace for viewing the sky and a cave-an entrance to a Daoist grotto-heaven. Based on the two-character signature at the left edge of the scroll, the painting has been identified as the work of Shen Xiyuan, a late fourteenth-century practitioner of the Southern Song academic tradition of Ma Yuan (active ca. 1190C1225). But many of the figural and landscape details reflect the styles of such mid-sixteenth-century artists as Zhou Chen and Qiu Ying, suggesting that a more appropriate date for the scroll would be the later sixteenth or early seventeenth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP204637_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/48914

Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute: The Story of Lady Wenji,Unidentified artist,early 15th century,"Represented here are scenes from the life of Lady Wenji (Cai Yan), who was abducted by a horde of marauding barbarians about A.D. 195 and spent twelve years among the Xiongnu, a Mongol tribe, as wife of their chieftain. She bore him two children before she was finally ransomed and returned to China. The Southern Song emperor Gaozong (r. 1127C62) probably ordered the story illustrated as a reminder of the capture of his kinfolk by the Jurchen Jin.In this scroll, the costumes of the nomad invaders are those of the Khitan people, who established the Liao dynasty (907C1125) in northeastern China. To the early Southern Song viewer, Eighteen Songs, which presents a historical drama in contemporary details, did not represent a mere historical romance but a true, pervasive national trauma. The illustrations to the third, fifth, thirteenth, and eighteenth songs in the Metropolitan's scroll―the oldest of five known versions that illustrate all eighteen of the songs―are almost exact copies of four album leaves in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The Boston fragments appear to be all that is left of the original twelfth-century scroll. The texts of the songs, composed by Liu Shang (act. ca. 773), are inscribed in the calligraphic style of Emperor Gaozong",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP213003_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39569

Scholars of the Liuli Hall,Unidentified artist,late 13th century,"Scholars of the Liuli Hall commemorates a famous gathering hosted by the poet Wang Changling (act. ca. 713-41) at his official residence in Jiangning (modern Nanjing, Jiangsu Province). An earlier, cut-down version of the same composition, entitled simply Literary Gathering (Palace Museum, Beijing), is attributed to Han Huang (723-787). The costumes and the style in which the figures are drawn, however, relate these works to Zhou Wenju, the great Southern Tang (937-75) court painter who used a ""tremulous brush line"" (zhanbi) to draw drapery.In the Metropolitan's scroll, Zhou's tenth-century style has been transformed by a thirteenth-century artist. The sensitively drawn faces are late Song in style; while more schematic than Tang (618-907) examples, they are more solidly and three-dimensionally conceived than those of the late Ming (16th-17th century). In describing the figures' robes, Zhou Wenju's ""tremulous brush line"" has become a virtuoso performance: elegant fluttering lines, at once playful and confident, are well integrated, and the hooks and curves representing creases and pockets show an extravagant realism matched only by the best late Southern Song Academy figure painters.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-19580-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39657

Chan master riding a mule,Unidentified artist,before 1249,"Painted in a few swift brushstrokes and deftly applied ink washes, Chan Master Riding a Mule exemplifies the freely expressive manner of Chan (Zen, in Japanese) Buddhist painting, which relies less on descriptive detail than on the capturing of spiritual concentration within the artist to achieve a vivid depiction. Inscribed by the noted Chan master Wuzhun, to whom it traditionally has been attributed, the painting is probably the work of a contemporary Chan artist following the sketchy brush style of Liang Kai (active first half of the thirteenth century).Wuzhun, well known for his wisdom as well as for his eccentric behavior, inscribed this painting while he was living at the Qingshansi, a Chan temple near Hangzhou, where he settled after he was rewarded by Emperor Lizong (r. 1225C1264) following an imperial audience. The rider's facial features-prominent forehead, mustache, and wispy beard-are not unlike those of Wuzhun himself, whose formal portrait, with an inscription by him dated 1238, is now in the Tofuku-ji temple in Kyoto. His laconic inscription may also be a self-deprecatory reference to himself:As rain darkens the mountain,One mistakes a mule for a horse.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-35889-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40276

In size, format, tree shape, and figurative details, its design emulates painted and dyed chintz palampores created in India.

Stele for Shi Chen,Unidentified artist,19th century rubbing; stele dated 169 CE,"For nearly eighteen hundred years, the stone stele from which this rubbing was taken has stood in the Temple of Confucius, adjacent to the sage's birthplace in Qufu, Shandong Province. The stele bears engraved texts concerning rituals conducted at the temple in Confucius's memory. When the official Shi Chen arrived in Qufu in A.D. 168, he personally financed an elaborate ritual that included sacrificial offerings. He then submitted a memorial to Emperor Ling (r. 168C69) requesting funds to pay for the rituals each year in the spring and autumn.The calligraphy on the stele is an example of Han-dynasty clerical script. Originally developed by scribes and bureaucrats for everyday writing, this script type came to be widely used for stone inscriptions requiring strict, orderly forms of writing. In clerical script, blocky characters fit into an imaginary grid, and strokes tend to be of even thickness. Some horizontal strokes end in sharply defined, angular tips, while curved and downward-flaring strokes display complex shapes. The spacious layout of the text and even spacing of the strokes create a sense of dignity appropriate to the stele's placement within the temple precinct.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP363587.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36445

The composition recalls that of Li Jie's Fisherman's Lodge at Xisai of about 1170. As the boat glides through the silvery moonlight, stillness reigns on the cool, scented water. The simplicity of the painting recalls the spare imagery of a Tang-dynasty (618C907) quatrain:Willows still by a lotus bank,A boat drifts slowly by.Ahead, tall grass, blue distant hills,White moon in golden sky.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153512.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40092

During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the cult of Lü Dongbin flourished under the influence of the Quanzhen (""Perfect Realization"") sect of Daoism. The center of the cult was the Yongle Gong (Temple of Eternal Joy) in Shanxi Province. The painting style of the figures and the architecture and landscape details of this fan relate closely to murals in Yongle Gong that date to the latter half of the Yüan period (1279C1368).

Two Horses,Unidentified,dated 1793,"Executed at the height of the artist's career, Two Horses is a study in complements: dark and light horses; earthen shoreline and rocky outcrop; and contrasting species of trees. Charged with distinguishing between truth and falsehood, good and evil, Qian's imagery seems to reflect the powerful contending forces with which he had to deal during his precariously balanced career. His distinctive use of shading to model forms reveals the growing impact of European engravings and painting techniques on Chinese artists of this period.A noted calligrapher who also specialized in the painting of horses, Qian Feng is best known for twice risking his life by bringing charges against unscrupulous officials linked to the Qianlong emperor's favorite, the notoriously corrupt Heshen (1758C1799). Since the connoisseurship of fine horses was a metaphor for the ability to judge and select men for government service, Qian's artistic specialization was particularly appropriate in light of his official duties, which required him to evaluate the performance of his peers in the bureaucracy.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/ASA97.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39765
Horse and Willow Tree,Unidentified artist,early 15th century,"Since the Han dynasty (206 B.C.CA.D. 220), fine horses have symbolized military power and imperial authority in China. For this reason, powerful steeds were a popular subject at the early Ming court. Frequently such paintings show sleek animals grazing, often tethered to willow trees. Perhaps such images were intended to connote an empire at peace, when warhorses were not required to subdue insurrection or combat foreign invaders",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153528.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36039

Basin with turtles and fish,Unidentified,14th century,"The design of this vessel reflects the fourteenth-century antiquarian taste. This type of water basin can be traced back to the Shang dynasty (ca. 1600C1046 B.C.), but the vessel’s design is based on a woodblock illustration in the 12th-century Xuanhe Bogutu, a catalogue of Song-dynasty imperial collection. The design of turtles and fish allude to the legend of a turtle that emerged from the Luo River bearing a divine book on its carapace. The vessel most likely functioned as a decorative piece in a scholar’s study meant to demonstrate the owner’s appreciation for antiquity.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-16217-003.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/772693
Ten Thousand Miles along the Yellow River,Unidentified artist,datable to 1690C1722,"Given the constant threat of flooding from the Yellow River, the study and management of that river system was one of the highest priorities of the Qing court. This monumental map graphically illustrates the complexity of controlling the Yellow River's channel and its potential impact on the numerous towns and cities in its drainage area. Painted around the time that the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662C1722) engaged a team of Jesuit missionaries to conduct a comprehensive survey of his empire, the map reflects the highest level of indigenous mapmaking before the introduction of European techniques. Indeed, the map's appeal lies not in its cartographic accuracy but in its pictorial treatment of terrain features. To unroll the scrolls is to vicariously experience the drama of voyaging up the Yellow River from the East China Sea to the rapids of the Dragon Gate.The map merges panoramic landscape painting and cartography: waterways are rendered in a planometric fashion (that is, they lie flat on the picture surface); mountains are depicted frontally; and architecture, notably walled towns and cities, are shown as isometric projections. There is no consistent use of foreshortening, perspective, atmospheric distortion, or diminution of scale to suggest spatial recession. One may speak of the bottom or top of the composition, but there is no measurable distinction between the foreground and the far distance. Nevertheless, the map is visually coherent, and its seemingly unbounded view of vast expanses enables the viewer to grasp far more than the eye could see in reality.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP163345_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73299
The Immortal Lü Dongbin Appearing over the Yueyang Pavilion,Unidentified artist,15thC16th century,"This album leaf appears to depict a scene in which the puckish Daoist immortal Lü Dongbin dazzles the local population of Yueyang by hovering over its famous pavilion on a magical cloud. In this artist’s rendition, the tower is almost a world unto itself, with broad galleries, soaring eaves, and a vast viewing platform. The magical landscape from which Lü has emerged is represented by a lone mountain, described economically with a broad, graded wash of dilute ink.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153541.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45677
"Plum, Bamboo and Rock",Unidentified artist,second half of the 14th century,"Blooming earlier than all other trees, the flowering plum (Prunus mume) is welcomed as the harbinger of spring and during the Southern Song period (1127C1279) became the object of intense admiration. By the mid-fourteenth century, as Mongol control disintegrated and society grew increasingly chaotic, the flowering plum became a powerful symbol of purity and endurance in the face of adversity.In a poem accompanying the painting, this unidentified scholar-painter recalls the poet Su Shi (1037C1101), who was banished from the capital in 1095 but found happiness in Plum Blossom Village, at the foot of Mount Luofu. By the second half of the fourteenth century, the kind of contentment discovered by Su Shi, like the path to the idyllic Plum Blossom Village, had become increasingly difficult to find. The poem reads:The flowing water of the stream glides by;Colorful birds chatter beneath the flowers.Of late I have taken an interest in [Mount] Luofu;But the path to the village grows dim in the twilight.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP223775.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49621

Buddhist Temples amid Autumn Mountains,Unidentified artist,14thC15th century,"Travelers wind their way through a riverine landscape dotted with rustic villages and Buddhist temples. As is the case with many Chinese paintings, the date of this one is difficult to determine. It boasts an impressive suite of colophons by fourteenth-century writers, including two renowned scholar-painters, Ni Zan and Lu Guang. Though the painting itself bears a signature of the tenth- to eleventh-century painter Yan Wengui, based on style it appears to be a copy from the fourteenth or fifteenth century, during or shortly after the time of Ni and Lu. Therefore, it is possible that these colophons were originally made for an earlier painting but later mounted to this work to enhance its value.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP213697_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40106

The poems have been part of the core curriculum for students of Chinese literature for a millennium, and although the original painting was lost long ago, its composition has survived in the form of rubbings and painted copies. This example merges the naive architectural forms of the original composition with the elegant painterly sensibility of the sixteenth-century followers of Wen Zhengming (1470C1559).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP165839_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/51419

Great Ease (Da zi zai),Chen Hui,2010,"This rectangular seal is made from translucent yellow-green soapstone with irregular markings in varying shades of gray. The bottom shows red stains from making impressions with red seal paste; the top is also tinted red, probably from contact with the stained interior of its storage box. The legend of the seal, “Great Ease” (Da zizai 大自在) , is carved in relief with evenly spaced lines of consistent width that are characteristic of seal script calligraphy. Each of the seal’s four sides is incised with a grid of four columns and 19 lines, which the artist has filled with a carved standard-script transcription of the Heart Sutra.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78172

The artist presents the complexly layered architecture of the Buddhist monastery―crowned at the top by a multistoried pagoda and occupying much of the small island―in intricate detail, but the true subject of the painting is mighty Yangzi, which flows eastward into the mist in the upper register.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73656
Hundred Layers of Ink,Yang Jiechang,1990,"For a decade between 1989 and 1999, Yang Jiechang worked on the series Hundred Layers of Ink, to which this painting belongs. It is the result of focused repetition: Yang applied ink to the same piece of paper, day after day, until the rectangle at its center was completely saturated. As the paper reaches saturation, the ink takes on a shimmery, luminescent quality, and the paper itself shifts from a two-dimensional surface to a three-dimensional object, merging figure and ground, coming close to sculpture. Though these are the same materials used by literati to make traditional paintings, Yang has reinvented them here, removing entirely the artist’s gesture as an index of meaning.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/671401

Plum blossoms,Lu Fu,dated 1505,"This ambitious handscroll is the surviving masterpiece of Lu Fu, a specialist in plum-blossom painting who lived and worked in Suzhou during the early sixteenth century. Delicate flowers cascade across a surface more than twenty feet in length, offering an up-close view of a horizontal slice of a plum tree in full bloom. With great precision, the artist reserved unpainted paper for the blossoms against a background of icy blue. The scroll is also a remarkably complete artifact of friendship among elite Suzhou society. Commissioned by a man named Zhang Ling to commemorate an afternoon spent with the famed scholar Shen Zhou (1427C1509), the scroll is inscribed by several of the most celebrated men of sixteenth-century Suzhou, including Shen, Tang Yin (1470C1524), and Wen Zhengming (1470C1559).",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39555
Fisherman and family,Zhang Lu,16th century,"Images of family life are relatively rare in premodern Chinese painting. This glimpse into the simple existence of a fisherman and his family aboard their small skiff was no doubt romanticized by the painter, whose style suggests a sophisticated artist working in the urban environs of Hangzhou rather than someone painting from observation along a countryside waterway. This painting presents the fisherman and his family as sincere and hardworking, their lives untouched by the vicissitudes of officialdom.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/13_220_115.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36023

Scholars in the Orchid Pavilion Gathering,Wu Wei,late 15th century,"In an unconventional move, Wu Wei employed the album format to create a close-up portrayal of individual participants in the famous Orchid Pavilion Gathering. Each painting features a single scholar sitting by a stream, on which float lotus leaves carrying wine cups. The swaying plants and the lively contour lines of the drapery capture the gentle stirring in the air. The men’s varied postures and activities reveal their temperaments and moods. Two appear absorbed, one contemplating the flowing water and the other an unfurled scroll. Another scholar is caught at a moment of distraction: ready to write with a brush lifted high in his right hand, he seems to have turned suddenly to gaze to his left. Most provocatively, a smiling man leans back on his arms, exposing his bared chest and protruding belly in total disregard of social decorum, a pose that epitomizes the free spirit of the event.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/706318

Su Wu Tending Sheep as Lady Wang Zhaojun Passes By,Hua Yan,first half of the 18th century,"This extraordinary composition combines into a continuous narrative the stories of two historical figures separated by time and geography. They have in common a long exile in the Mongolian wilderness, the site of conflict between the nomadic Xiongnu people and Han China (206 B.C.CA.D. 220). Su Wu (ca. 140Cca. 60 B.C.), pictured with grazing goats in the lower right, went to the Xiongnu as an imperial envoy in 100 B.C. Upon refusing to shift his allegiance, he was banished to Lake Baikal in modern Siberia to herd rams. Holding his emissary staff, he gazes across a frigid river at a female rider surrounded by nomadic horsemen. She is Wang Zhaojun (ca. 52Cca. 15 B.C.), chosen (through trickery) to be married off to the Xiongnu chieftain to cement a political alliance in 33 B.C. Su Wu eventually returned home, after nineteen years, but Zhaojun died in the foreign land.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/75379

Fu Baoshi began taking commissions for seal carvings while still in high school to help his family after his father’s death, and he continued to carve seals for himself and others throughout his life. His design sensibility is shown in the imaginative interplays between figure and ground that are inherent to seal carving.The creation of albums of seal impressions also has a long history. Within this genre, collections of seal impressions belonging to individual artists have served as catalogues of their carving skills as well as a reference for comparison with examples on extant works of art.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/76642

Appreciation for carved script styles deepened as the historical value of Han and Six Dynasties stones called into question later brush written model books. Wu Xizai brought an aesthetic preference for firm, sustained brushwork into his seal carving and painting. His elegant seal cutting style, seen in the two cinnabar-ink impressions that follow his inscription on this painting, was greatly admired by Wu Changshi (1844C1927).",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49450

He was one of the most respected connoisseurs in 20th century China.His subject in this fan is a literati favorite, bamboo: its value as a symbol is that it bends without breaking while artistically, it reflects every movement of the painter's brush in its demand for calligraphic line.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49699
Settling Accounts with a Traitor,Shi Lu,1930s and 1940s,"The Modern Woodcut Movement is an important but understudied chapter in the history of twentieth-century Chinese art. The movement was initiated by Lu Xun (1881C1936), the father of modern Chinese literature and an incisive cultural critic, who saw woodcut as the ideal medium for rousing what he saw as a complacent China from its slumber to face up to the challenges of the modern world. Easily produced from inexpensive materials and with relatively limited training, woodcut was seen as a counterpoint to the precious erudition of literati landscape painting. The medium was used extensively during the 1930s and ‘40s―by both Communist and Nationalist leaders―to disseminate political messages in a graphically impactful, legible form. Some of the most iconic vignettes from the War of Resistance (against Japan, 1937C45) and the Chinese Civil War (1945C49) were produced in this medium. The current set of prints were produced in the Communist milieu―at Yan’an, the mountain stronghold in northern Shaanxi Province that served as the capital of the Communist government during the 1940s.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-26917-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/892093

Chen Zi’ang Testing a Zither,Huang Shen,dated 1737,"The poet Chen Zi'ang (659C700) traveled to the capital of the Tang dynasty to pursue his career but was frustrated by his inability to gain recognition for his talents. One day in the marketplace, he came upon someone selling an ancient zither for an incredibly high price. After testing it, Chen paid 1,000 ingots of silver to purchase it. Turning to the many curious onlookers, he remarked, ""I am a good zither player. Come to my place tomorrow, and I will play for you."" The next day, a large crowd gathered at Chen's residence to hear him perform. In front of this audience, Chen suddenly smashed the zither and said, ""Entertaining people is the work of slaves. How can I do that?"" He then took out his poems and passed them around. Everyone was astonished by Chen's behavior, and his brilliance immediately became widely known.This handscroll is a masterful demonstration of Huang Shen's skill at rendering a broad range of figure types and social classes in a dashing, spontaneous manner. Huang's status as a professional painter must have made this story particularly appealing to him.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/75377

To maintain peace on the northern border of their shrunken empire, the Chinese paid annual tributes amounting to 200,000 taels of silver and 200,000 bolts of silk.Although there is no inscription to confirm it, the theme of this scroll may be the Song envoys meeting those of the Jin. Painters under the Jin continued the styles of the Northern Song, albeit with modifications. In contrast to the dramatic scale of the massive peaks in Northern Song painting, the forms here stress surface abstraction; the mountains are softened with green wash and the valleys are laced with mist.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP165265_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39959

The Sixteen Luohans,Qiu Ying,16th or 17th century,"Best known for his paintings rendered in brilliant mineral colors, Qiu Ying sometimes worked in ink alone to demonstrate his skill as a draftsman. In this dynamic procession of luohans and their attendants, the figures are enlivened through exquisitely controlled, undulating and folded brush lines and luminous graded washes. Qiu's enthusiasm for detail is evident in the remarkable individualization of the holy men's eccentric features and the delicate textile designs of their robes. Although the artist's inscription credits the monk-artist Guanxiu (832C912) as the source of his inspiration, the ninth-century master's grotesque luohans have here been replaced by elegant Sinicized ascetics.Reflecting the blending of Buddhism and Confucianism in later Chinese culture, this procession of luohans is shown ceremoniously escorting a Chinese scholar―identifiable by his tall cap and full robes―and his retinue out of the clouds.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP205345_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44592

Flowers,Lü Jingfu,14th century,"This decorative work of the Piling school of flower painting compares closely to signed works by the late-fourteenth-century painter Lü Jingfu. Originally one of a matching pair of panels, the painting shows butterflies and a praying mantis flying amid a late-spring bouquet of poppies, asters, Chinese pinks, and chrysanthemums; a salamander in the center foreground is flanked by an orchid on the left and a cabbage on the right. The flowers and insects are flawlessly executed in fine precise brushwork and colored in delicate hues of pink, white, green, and purple, with malachite green and powder-white highlights.Similar motifs are found on blue-and-white ceramics and other decorative arts of the period where floral elements appear with frogs, salamanders, praying mantises, and cicadas. The salamander, when shown with a praying mantis devouring a cicada, symbolizes cyclical predation in nature and echoes a famous passage from the Zhuangzi: ""Creatures are so enmeshed in nature, one species always preying on another."" The popularity of such motifs in fourteenth-century art seems to reflect the political climate of the time, when China, ruled by the Mongols, was beset by repression and injustice.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT235402.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45655
Grand View of Mountains and Rivers,Dai Jin,mid-15th century,"Dai Jin was the most talented and versatile landscape painter of the early fifteenth century. His gifts were recognized by multiple Ming emperors, who invited him to serve as official painter at the imperial court. In this ambitious handscroll, appropriately titled Grand View of Mountains and Rivers, Dai revels in his mastery of multiple styles. Some of these are identifiable, such as the layered horizontal dots of the Mi family style near the beginning and the angular axe-cut textured strokes of Xia Gui near the end, but others are more composite. Though Dai often painted in the manner of earlier masters, this is a rare work that combines multiple brush modes into a single, grandly conceived composition.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/774820
Divinities of the Planets and Constellations,Qiu Ying,16th century,"The subject and imagery of this painting are derived from a composition attributed to the Tang dynasty (618C907) artist Liang Lingzan that is now in the collection of the Osaka Municipal Museum of Art. The painting depicts the deities of the Five Planets, which correspond to the five primary elements―wood (Jupiter), fire (Mars), earth (Saturn), metal (Venus), and water (Mercury)―and the twenty-eight constellations of the Chinese zodiac.Qiu Ying, a fine artist in his own right, was also famous as a skilled copyist of earlier paintings. Such copies were highly valued by collectors and other artists who might not have access to the originals. This painting bears the signature and seals of Qiu Ying but may itself be a later copy.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP205779_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44593
Grooms and Foreign Horses,Jin Nong,17thC18th century,"Jin Nong, a noted scholar, connoisseur, and calligrapher, took up painting around the age of fifty after his failure, in 1736, to be recruited as an official. Jin's paintings of horses, dated examples of which all come from 1760C61, are a poignant expression of his frustrated political ambitions, as he makes clear in his accompanying poems, which draw upon the well-established metaphor that an aptitude for recognizing fine horses was akin to an ability to judge and select men for government service.In this powerfully eccentric painting, Jin's intentionally awkward and self-consciously archaic revival of a composition and theme associated with Zhao Mengfu (1254C1322), a Chinese scholar whose service under the Mongols led to a number of positive reforms, makes clear Jin's aspiration to perform a similar function under the Manchu Qing dynasty. Inscribed with a poem that bemoans the absence of a worthy judge of horses, the painting is a thinly veiled lament that expresses the artist's feelings of being misunderstood and unappreciated:I happened to see a painting of foreign horses by a man of the Yuan dynasty. I made a copy of it while a guest and inscribed a poem:Bathed three times in the Dragon Pool, yearly they galloped out,With futile ambition they rushed to respond to their lord's will.Now led to the red gates of the wealthy, where a high price is asked,What man, with a single look, could make them worth a thousand tales?",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/ASA96.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39767

Riverbank,Dong Yuan,未知年代,"During the chaotic years following the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907, centralized rule was shattered and China splintered into a number of short-lived kingdoms. Among the most important of these was the Southern Tang dynasty (937C75), which governed much of the lower Yangzi River delta from its capital at Nanjing. It was there that a distinctive “southern” style of landscape painting developed under the court official and artist Dong Yuan.Riverbank epitomizes Dong Yuan’s new style, with its absence of contour lines and use of subtle ink washes and soft-rubbed texture strokes to describe the distinctive rounded hills and earthen slopes of southeastern China. The depiction of a scholar-hermit living in elegant reclusion likewise established a lasting thematic ideal. Darkened with age, the scroll, the tallest of all surviving early Chinese landscape paintings, marks the majestic inception of the monumental landscape tradition.The scroll was split in two along its vertical seam during the fourteenth century. The left-hand side of the composition, with its tall foreground trees backed by an impenetrable screen of thrusting and twisting mountain forms, inspired a major revival of the Dong Yuan style among scholar-artists of the Yuan dynasty (1279C1368).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-13074-006.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39542

Heart Sutra,Fung Ming Chip,2001,"A self-taught calligrapher and seal-carver, Fung made this pair of hanging scrolls as a meditation on the content of the widely known Buddhist text the Heart Sutra. In both scrolls, Fung has transcribed the same text, but in each case he has taken advantage of the special qualities of paper and ink to intensify the scripture’s message, that form and emptiness are one and the same. On one scroll Fung wrote the text in pale ink. On the other, he first wrote the text in water. This text only became visible when he applied a layer of dark ink over it, resulting in ghostlike traces where the water-saturated paper only partially absorbed the ink.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/75761

Marvelous Verses without Sounds,Xiao Yuncong,ca. 1660C73,"This ethereal album is an example of the “three perfections” (sanjue 三^), the combination of painting, poetry, and calligraphy into a cohesive work of art. For scholarly artists like Xiao Yuncong, a successful expression of the three perfections was considered the greatest achievement, a creative act that revealed the depth of the artist’s learning and refinement. Xiao lived through the fall of the Ming dynasty, and his melancholy poems inscribed here express his desire for reclusion from a world that he saw as irrevocably damaged. The artist’s weighty poetry contrasts with his gossamer-light application of silvery ink and his surprising, sometimes humorous compositions, such as the man washing his feet in a stream.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/65631
Couplet by Han Yu,Emperor Guangzong,未知年代,"This writing is related to the regular script style of Emperor Gaozong (r. 1127C62) but is quite different from that of Emperor Lizong (r. 1224C64). The closest stylistic comparison is a transcription of the Diamond Sutra by the Song courtier Zhang Jizhi (1186C1266) written in the same large regular script and dated 1246. While no extant work by Guangzong is known, this writing may prove to be by his hand. The couplet is taken from the poem New Bamboo by the great Tang writer Han Yu (768C824):[The bamboo's] lofty appearance defies the austerity of autumn,Its chaste color surpasses the lush beauty of spring.(Wen C.

Landscape in the Style of Zhao Boju (Fang Zhao Boju shanshui),Wang Hui,dated 1654,"This painting is Wang Hui’s second earliest extant work. Done barely two years into his apprenticeship under the preeminent master Wang Shimin (1592C1680), it shows an approach that differs entirely from that of his earliest known work of 1650 and reflects his exposure to the region’s great collections of ancient masters.According to Wang’s inscription, the painting follows the style of Zhao Boju (died ca. 1162), a Southern Song academy painter known for his landscapes in the blue-and-green style. The calligraphic contour lines and texture dots of Wang’s interpretation, however, owe more to Wang Shimin than to the twelfth-century master.One year before his death Wang added a second inscription:This painting was done in my youth; suddenly, more than sixty years have gone by.

Dragon and Landscape,Unidentified artist,14th century; plus later addition,"This scroll presents a view of undulating billows and a rocky shoreline where several gnarled trees cling to a bare cliff. To the left of the trees two dragons appear amid the clouds and inky darkness. The dragons' writhing bodies and hooked claws contrast with the angular planes of the rock faces and echo the twisted trunks and clinging roots of the trees. One dragon seems to emerge from the rock itself, while the other is depicted playfully, stretched belly up across a rocky incline.This short, abruptly cropped composition was originally part of a much longer handscroll, other fragments of which are now in Japan and in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Compared with Chen Rong's Nine Dragons handscroll of 1244, also in Boston, the brushwork of this scroll is much coarser, suggesting that it was painted by a later follower.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP200858_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36042

The Eighteen Luohans,Ding Yunpeng,19th century?; spurious date of 1607,"In the seventeenth century, Ding Yunpeng became famous for his fantastical depictions of luohans. This scroll bears a signature by Ding, but the figures’ facial shapes and the fluttering, gossamer-light brushwork suggest that it is a nineteenth-century copy.

Struggle on the Front Line,Li Jingfang,1974,"Created during the Cultural Revolution, this print from the politically charged series The Furnace Fire Is Even Redder illustrates the production of iron and steel in the Angang model factory in Liaoning Province, in northeast China. The Angang Constitution, enacted in 1960 for the corporation’s management, embodied the Communist ideology regarding shared labor among all personnel. Here, a manager and a manual laborer work together at the furnace.Typical of Cultural Revolution graphic art in the 1970s, heroic figures are placed at the center of a large, dramatic composition.

Ode on Returning Home,Qian Xuan,14thC15th century,"Qian Xuan was a celebrated Song loyalist who, following the Mongol conquest, supported himself through painting. Toward the end of his life, however, he complained that his works were being forged. Here, both the calligraphy and painting are modeled closely on Qian's style, suggesting that the work is a faithful copy.Qian's composition was inspired by Tao Qian's (365C427) poem ""Returning Home,"" written in 405 after Tao resigned from public office. In it, Tao expresses his preference for poverty over the compromises and constraints of official life, establishing forever the ideal of the home and garden as a personal retreat. Clearly, Qian saw Tao's poem as a reflection of his own life in reclusion. Using the archaic ""blue-and-green"" style in a new, purposefully naive manner, he created a dreamlike environment that exists outside the realm of temporal troubles. His poem, written to the left of the picture, is both an appreciation of Tao and an expression of his state of mind:In front of his gate he plants five willows,By the eastern fence, he picked chrysanthemums.In his long chant is a lingering purity,There is never enough wine to sustain him.To live in this world it is necessary to become deeply drunk,To take office would only bring shame.In a moment of inspiration he composes ""Returning Home""The poem of one thousand years.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP166346_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40311
Nomads hunting with falcons,Chen Juzhong,early 13th century,"Chen Zhuzhong specialized in depicting nomadic horsemen and their lives on the steppes.

River Village in Autumn Dawn,Zhao Lingrang,13th century,"Zhao Lingrang (also known as Zhao Danian), a scion of the Song imperial family, was forbidden by dynastic statutes to travel any distance from the capital; he therefore painted mostly intimate, local, suburban scenery. As a collector, Zhao learned painting by studying ancient masterworks rather than the often wild nature of northern China, as did his great contemporaries such as Guo Xi (ca. 1000Cca. 1090). Turning his limitations into a virtue, Zhao strove to capture the mood of single lyrical moments with all their particular qualities, thereby presaging the more intimate ""mind landscapes"" of the Southern Song and Yuan periods.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP165233_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39920

Three scenes from festivals of the twelve months,Unidentified artist,late 18thCearly 19th century,"These two paintings almost certainly once belonged to a set of hanging scrolls or a multipanel screen. While the complete suite may or may not have illustrated a continuous narrative, this pair clearly relates to legendary immortals honored in seasonal festivals.The painting on the left depicts the Qixi Festival that celebrates the rendezvous of a cowherd and a weaver maiden on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. Having been banished to opposite sides of the Milky Way, they reunite on a sky bridge formed by a flock of magpies, as seen in the scroll’s top register. The couple holding hands in a lavish garden setting in the foreground may refer to the Tang emperor Xuanzong (r. 712C56) and his lover Yang Guifei (719C756), who famously pledged their eternal love on this night.The painting on the right illustrates the physical and spiritual ascension of the lunar goddess Chang’e from her earthly home to the moon, which is celebrated at the Mid-Autumn Festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month. A blue circular portal in the upper register reveals the newly arrived goddess in a red robe enjoying music in celestial company. The white rabbit in front, working a mortar and pestle to make an elixir, is a mythical denizen of the moon.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/679188
Two Birds on a Wintry Tree,Unidentified artist,13th century,"Two magpies, their feathers fluffed up against the cold, represent a warm reminder of the inevitability of spring. Such pictures of paired birds were often given as birthday gifts to elderly couples.

Woman in a garden,Ren Xiong,mid-19th century,"During his tragically short life, Ren Xiong produced some of the most striking and innovative paintings of the nineteenth century. In this image of a dignified woman sitting in a garden, the contrast between the broad strokes used for the setting and the meticulous treatment of the face creates an eerie effect, imparting an unsettling vitality to the figure. Ren’s paintings often reveal an interest in patterning, such as the swirls on the mat that covers the rock. Few paintings by the artist survive, but he was much admired and emulated; this might be by a follower of the next generation.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-L_2016_67_32_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/737761

Meeting between Yaoshan and Li Ao,Zhiweng,before 1256,"This painting was inscribed by the Chan (Zen) Buddhist priest Yanxi Guangwen between 1254 and 1256, while he was abbot of Lingyin temple in Hangzhou. The work is an important example of early Chan Buddhist ""apparition"" painting, so called for its pale, sensitive brushwork.Depicted here is a famous encounter between the Confucian scholar Li Ao (active ca. 840) and the Chan master Yaoshan. Having heard of the master's reputation, the scholar went to see him but was disappointed and remarked: ""Seeing your face is not as good as hearing your name."" The master replied: ""Would you distrust your eye and value your ear?"" Then, pointing up and down, the master indicated that the ultimate reality is in what can be seen, such as ""clouds in the sky and water in a vase.""Yanxi Guangwen's inscription on the painting reads:All moments of enlightenment come in a flash,Why distrust your eye and value your ear?Just as between the water and the clouds,Do not say there is nothing there.Just as the Chan master used riddles to sharpen the student's perception in spite of distracting hearsay, the Chan painter used a simple and spontaneous, albeit elusive, brush style to capture his fleeting vision of truth.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP154109.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40278

Fish at play,Zhao Kexiong,12thClate 13th century,"During the reign (1101C25) of Emperor Huizong, the cultivation of rare aquarium fish came into vogue, and playful, splashing fish in plant-filled waters became a popular subject. In the Xuanhe huapu (preface dated 1120), the catalogue of Huizong’s painting collection, the author of the essay ""Fishes and Dragons” decries still-life representations of fish as “objects on a kitchen table” but praises pictures of fish that “play in the wide expanse and dive in the deep.” In Fish at Play, where six slim, nimble fish flip and weave through the grasses, the painter’s genius for suggesting life and movement by the graceful deployment of elegant, curving lines is fully in evidence. Flawlessly executed, the image is at once a metaphor for and a re-creation of natural life at its freest and most spontaneous.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153501.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39937

Palace ladies bathing children,Unidentified artist,11th century,"Depictions of the daily life of court ladies became a special genre of painting under the influence of the eighth-century painter Zhou Fang and his tenth-century follower Zhou Wenju. Painting in a richly detailed manner in which even the fabric patterns are meticulously described, these two artists had an important influence on the figure style practiced by the Song Painting Academy. This painting closely follows Tang dynasty (618C907) prototypes: the tight group of figures arrayed in an oval and set against a blank background is a typical Tang style composition; the hesitant brushwork, however, suggests that it is a later copy, probably done in the Northern Song period.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP214285_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39935

Dragon Boat Regatta on Jinming Lake,Wang Zhenpeng,14th century (?),"Dragon boat races are traditionally held on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month to commemorate the death of the virtuous minister Qu Yuan (343C277 B.C.), who drowned himself to refute slander. Depicted here is a race sponsored by Emperor Huizong (r. 1101C25) on the third day of the third month, on Jinming (""Golden Bright"") Lake, which was located in an imperial park at the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng.The picture is a remarkable example of jiehua, or ""ruled-line,"" painting, the intricate style of depicting architecture perfected by Wang Zhenpeng. According to the inscription, Wang executed this painting in 1323 for the Grand Elder Princess Sennge (ca. 1283C1331), the older sister of Emperor Renzong (r. 1312C20), after a similar composition he had painted for Renzong in 1310.A powerful figure in the Mongol court, Princess Sennge was one of the foremost art collectors of the age, and her seals appear on many early paintings and calligraphies. Two of her seals are impressed on the Metropolitan scroll: one in the upper-right corner of the painting, the other following Wang's inscription. The weak carving of the legends and the harsh color of the seal paste, however, suggestthat both seals are forgeries. The stiffness of Wang's clerical-script inscription also marks it as a copy. The subject was immensely popular―at least five other versions of this composition exist.

Orchid and rock,Ma Shouzhen,dated 1572,"In sixteenth-century China, courtesans played an active role in elite society.

Courtesans, by contrast, were celebrated for their talents in literature, painting, and music, and they participated in scholarly gatherings. Ma Shouzhen was one of the most famous of these; she mixed freely with the literary luminaries of Suzhou and Nanjing and carried on a long-term romance with the poet Wang Zhideng.

Only when separated does one see that the flat “inside” surfaces have each been incised with texts. The base of each caddy also bears a poem. The texts, by noted literary figures of the Tang (618-907), Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1271-1368) dynasties, all celebrate the joys of living in harmony with nature.

Plucking Chrysanthemums,Zhang Feng,dated 1658,"This painting is a copy of a work by the writer-artist Zhang Feng. The original, a birthday gift for a friend, was executed on the eve of the Double Ninth Festival―the ninth day of the ninth lunar month―when tradition called for ascending the heights and drinking chrysanthemum wine. Zhang's subject matter was undoubtedly inspired by the occasion, but it also pays tribute to the poet Tao Qian (365C427), who was renowned both for his rejection of an official position and for his love of chrysanthemums and wine. He depicts the chrysanthemum's most famous admirer enjoying the bouquet of a plant that has grown in the company of rocks and bamboo―symbols of a life in reclusion, which, on a different level, can be construed as congratulatory wishes for long life.Zhang's two poems read:In the light rain of this clear autumn,Today is your birthday.With the Double Ninth Festival just around the corner,I should first search out a chrysanthemum for you.So much have I learned as I grow older,Now is the time to put myself on strong foundations.With a deep draught of wine,[I contemplate the paradises lying to] the west and south,Their powerful radiance is indestructible.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-21613-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/48946

Couplet on pond scenery,Emperor Xiaozong,ca. 12th century,"The individual brush mannerisms of this couplet, though stylistically related to the calligraphy of Emperor Gaozong (1107C1187), to whom it has traditionally been attributed, compare most closely with those found in Eulogy on Calligraphy by Gaozong's son, Xiaozong. This attribution is supported by the fan's three-character dedication to [Zhao] Zhizhong, a eunuch in Xiaozong's service. The imperial seal impressed over the dedication that reads ""Treasure of imperial writing,"" as well as the unequal spacing between characters in the right-hand line, a feature that reveals a degree of spontaneity in execution unlikely from a scribe, further corroborate the conclusion that this piece is from the emperor's own hand.The couplet describes the stillness of a pond at evening:Above the pond, a thin mist envelops theemerald green;At water's edge, the late sun plays withdragonflies.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP153495.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40060

"Rock, Tiger Lily and Orchid",Unidentified,dated 1627,"Zhao Wenchu (born Wen Shu) was a fourth-generation descendant of the Suzhou luminary Wen Zhengming. Like most members of the family―men and women―she received a first-rate classical education. Many women painters of the Ming dynasty focused on floral themes; for some, this may have been a preference, but others were likely guided toward this genre because of the association of women with gardens and blossoms. A lack of refinement in the brushwork of this example suggests that it may be by one of the many later painters who produced works in Zhao’s style.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-35899-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49047
Nine Songs,Zhao Mengfu,14thC15th century,"The Nine Songs are lyrical, shamanistic incantations dedicated to nine classes of deities worshipped by the Chu people of south China during the first millennium B.C. The original text consists of eleven songs, ten of which are transcribed and illustrated here. The illustrations are preceded by a portrait of the poet Qu Yuan (343C277 B.C.), which is accompanied by an essay entitled ""The Fisherman,"" recounting the poet's state of mind toward the end of his life.Zhao Mengfu's paintings for the Nine Songs in the baimiao, or ""white-drawing"" style, are based on compositions by Li Gonglin (ca. 1041C1106) and were a primary source for later fourteenth-century paintings of this theme by Zhang Wu (active 1333C65) and others. Because the calligraphy in the album does not compare with the best of Zhao Mengfu's writing, it is probable that these leaves represent close, reliable copies of Zhao's important work, executed during the fourteenth century. One leaf, ""The Lord of Clouds,"" is a later replacement (no earlier than the seventeenth century).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP375123_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40511
Couplet from Song Zhiwen’s poem “Ascending the Pavilion at the Monastery of Meditative Concentration”,Mi Wanzhong,late 16th or early 17th century,"Mi Wanzhong was a well-known calligrapher, painter, and connoisseur of the late Ming period who claimed descent from the eminent Northern Song artist-connoisseur Mi Fu (1052C1107). While holding the post of judicial inspector in Nanjing, Mi Wanzhong fell afoul of the notorious palace eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568C1627) and was forced to retire to his garden estate on the outskirts of Beijing in 1625. During his retirement, he whiled away the time indulging in artistic pursuits, including painting scenes of his garden on lanterns that came to be known as ""Mi family lanterns."" It was not until 1631, four years after the eunuch's death, that Mi was reappointed to government service. Moyai (monumental writing carved into cliffs) became a special art in north China during the sixth century.

"Cranes, peach tree, and China rose",Shen Quan,18th century,"In 1731 the court painter Shen Quan traveled to Nagasaki at the request of the Japanese government. During his nearly two years in Japan, Shen and his students produced a large number of paintings in this style―typified by bold ink brushwork for rocks and trees paired with meticulous application of color for birds and flowers―which served as an enduring inspiration to Japanese artists. This example combines cranes, peaches, and lingzhi fungus, all symbols of longevity or immortality, along with bamboo and China rose (yueji).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP277568.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36105

Classic of Spiritual Flight,Zhong Shaojing,ca. 738,"The copying of sutras, the sacred texts of Buddhism and Daoism, was an act of devotion as well as a means of propagating the faith. It required a special brush, paper of a conventional size with a vertical grid, and the use of the strictest, most formal script. This hallowed fragment of a Daoist religious text meets all of those requirements yet has an elegance and fluency that elevate it beyond normal sutra writing.Commissioned in 738 by Princess Yuzhen, a daughter of Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712C56), this writing exemplifies the sophisticated court style of the High Tang period. The small script is balanced and harmonious, with every hook, stroke, and dot perfectly defined and executed. Applied with a stiff, long-pointed brush, each stroke shows clean, crisp movements and graceful, saber-sharp turns. Individual characters are straight, upright, and firmly built, with a rectangular frame of supports and walls. The construction of the characters reveals an analytical process: different types of brushstrokes are seen as forces (shi) in a dynamic composition, each having a perfect form and a “method” (fa) of interacting with the other strokes; each character, with its elegant, carefully considered deployment of those forces, exemplifies a model of physical equilibrium and spiritual repose.In the early seventeenth century, this sutra was acquired by the influential painter, calligrapher, and theorist Dong Qichang (1555C1636), who regarded it as one of the finest extant examples of Tang-dynasty small writing. Dong reluctantly lent the sutra to a Mr. Chen for inclusion in a set of rubbings of model calligraphies, the Bohai cangzhen, but held back twelve columns for safekeeping. Dong was justified in his apprehension; the surviving forty-three columns that we celebrate today are those that were removed from the sutra by the unscrupulous Mr. Chen.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP154058.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36439

Rather than rendering an objective description of the physical beauty of pear blossoms, Qian drew in a fine calligraphic line and used flat schematic patterns in elegant pale colors to create a mood of cool detachment, reflective of his state of mind. The tender lyricism of the poem is also fully present in his calligraphy, in which the brushstrokes echo the languidly twisting movement of the pear leaves.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP204133_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40309

Dragon Pine on Mount Huang,Unidentified artist,ca. 1660,"This monumental work is one of the monk-painter Hongren's many portraits of the powerfully eccentric pines on Mount Huang, a scenic spot in Anhui Province. He was a guiding figure of the Anhui school of painters, whose common bond was their fascination with the rugged scenery of Mount Huang. Hongren favored a dry linear style that echoed the lofty moral character of the Yuan dynasty recluse-painter Ni Zan (1306C1374). Intense emotion lurks beneath the surface of Hongren's seemingly cool and detached style.A staunch Ming loyalist, Hongren became a Buddhist monk after the Manchu conquest of the south in 1645. His poem, inscribed on this painting, alludes to the theme of endurance and survival, long associated with the great pine:Coiled above a mountain peak, his physiqueis superb.How old is he? What man can tell?the elixir of immortality, at the beginningof time,[The pine's] dense scales and claws were alreadyfully grown.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36802-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49127

Inscriptions from the Stele of Mount Yi,Xu Xuan,date of stele: Song dynasty (960C1279),"In 219 B.C., on the first of many inspection tours of his vast empire, the First Emperor of Qin visited Mount Yi. He ordered that a stele be erected there, and calligraphed with a text in the newly standardized script. The text praises the emperor for bringing peace to the world by defeating Qin’s six rival states and unifying them under his rule. Although the stele was destroyed by fire during the Tang dynasty (618C907), the inscription was passed down by scholars; the present rubbings were taken from a stele that dates from the tenth century A.D. While the calligraphic style is of that era, the balanced structure and relatively uniform size of the characters derive from the seal script established by the Qin, echoing the glorious tradition of this mighty but short-lived state.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-12237-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/64022

Eight Songs of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers,Unidentified artist,16th or 17th century,"In the eleventh century, an artist named Song Di painted a set of melancholy landscapes evoking the river watersheds of the Xiao and Xiang region in current-day Hunan Province, southwest China. Poets of the day responded to Song’s paintings with corresponding poems, giving rise to a tradition of Xiao-Xiang poetry and painting that continued in subsequent centuries in China and eventually extended to Japan and Korea. This rendition bears a signature of the Ming-dynasty artist Wen Zhengming, but both the calligraphy and painting lack Wen’s subtlety; it is believed to have been painted in his style after his death.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP161037_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36103

Landscape No. 398,Wang Jiqian (C. C. Wang),1981,"Landscape No. 398 is a meditation on the dry brush mode of the monk-painter Hongren (1610C1664). Wang painted with the brush at a slanted angle but valued brushwork that he described as “round,” or “center-tipped,” meaning that the brush never turned over to create sharp creases or angles. Though Wang’s brush moves in angular formations in this work, close examination reveals that he always kept the tip of the brush centered to avoid what he called “ribbon-like” lines, a violation of the brushwork standards that he considered canonical within the tradition of scholarly landscape painting. 398 is a study in the challenges and contradictions of such brushwork, the interplay of angular form with rounded brushwork. Wang’s brush darts this way and that, following an internal sense of form based on years of study of ancient masterpieces. Though the work he arrives at is largely abstract, its connection to premodern landscape is palpable in its brushwork and sense of composition. The addition of a few buildings, sailboats, and human figures added by Wang’s friend Cheng Shifa (1921C2007), transform the work from an exercise in abstraction into a landscape painting (Fig. 2).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-12382-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/719421

The Moon Goddess Chang E,Unidentified artist,未知年代,"A supremely gifted scholar and painter, Tang Yin forfeited all chances of an official career after being involved in an examination scandal in the capital in 1499. Turning to painting and writing poetry for a living, he led the life of a dissolute scholar and died in poverty. The brilliantly executed Moon Goddess, Chang E is a poignant reminder of Tang Yin's dashed dreams for success in the official examinations, symbolized by the cassia branch in the goddess's left hand. (The word for ""cassia"" [gui] is a pun on the word for ""nobility"" [also pronounced gui].) Tang Yin's poem, in bold calligraphy, reads:She was long ago a resident of the Moon Palace,Where phoenixes and cranes gathered and embroideredbanners fluttered in heavenly fragrance.Chang E, in love with the gifted scholar,Breaks off [for him] the topmost branch of the cassia tree.A frequent visitor to Suzhou's notorious pleasure quarter, Tang Yin may have painted this glamorous figure, a portrait perhaps, for a favorite companion, whom he regarded as a goddess condemned to mortal suffering. A rectangular seal next to his signature proudly proclaims the artist's moment of worldly success, which occurred in 1498: ""Placed First [in the] Nanjing [Provincial Examination].""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT9281.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/45754

Tray with women and boys on a garden terrace,China,14th century,"Scenes of harmonious families featuring women and frolicking children―expressions of the hope for and joy of having offspring―began to appear in Chinese decorative art in the late Song dynasty (960C1279). This massive platter’s relief carving is typical of high Yuan-dynasty style. Three different geometric patterns―respectively delineating sky, water, and land―are testament to the artist’s sophisticated skill.

Incense burner,China,late 18th century,"This massive tripod incense burner is a rare example of Chinese rootwood carving. Known as “natural wood” (tianran mu), such objects sought to evoke a rustic lifestyle by accentuating the irregularities inherent in rootwood over the regular surfaces of most human-made objects. Replicating the shape of a bronze tripod, it was further imbued with the archaistic taste so highly appreciated among the literati, reflecting both objects of antiquity and nature.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-28651-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/894285

Inkstand in the shape of a butterfly,China,19th century,"This enamel work demonstrates a joyful fusion of Chinese design and Western function. Inkstands were commonly used in the West when quills and dip pens were popular writing accessories.

Standing attendant,China,7th century,"This standing attendant is likely a rare representation of a non-Han Chinese figure from the north, as suggested by his plump face with narrowed eyes, his long hair in double braids, and his costume of a tunic with wide lapels, loose trousers, and pointed boots.

Ewer with dancing figures,China,ca. 9th century,"The curly hair of the dancer appliqued to the ewer suggests that this figure is not of Chinese ethnicity.

Jar with carp in lotus pond,China,mid-16th century,"Perfecting the enameling techniques developed earlier in the Ming dynasty, porcelain enamelers of the Jiajing period created rich reds, yellows, and greens, superimposed onto underglaze blue. Contemporaneous sources attest to the firing of two hundred jars with similar pond scenes during the twenty-first year of the Jiajing reign (1542). Eroded areas of similar jars in other museums show that the deep red hues were created by overlaying a red enamel on a yellow base, a technique that lends the design an immediate visual impact.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP342697.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42549
Vase,China,11thC12th century,"Vases in this shape have long been known as “prunus vases” or meiping, a Chinese term that is also a homonym for beautiful vessel.

Tripod incense burner with archaistic patterns,China,12th century,"This censer demonstrates the continued importance of antiquarianism among patrons of Yaozhou stoneware during the twelfth century, when most of north China was under the rule of the Jurchen Jin dynasty.

Figure of a charioteer,China,4thC3rd century BCE,"This figure is among the earliest Chinese representations of nomadic peoples on the northern frontier.

Dish in Shape of Mount Fuji with Horses and Deer,China,ca. 1625,"The shape of the dish, which alludes to the famed Mount Fuji, indicates that it was commissioned by a Japanese patron, most likely for a meal that accompanied the tea ceremony.

Herdboy with water buffalo,China,18thC19th century,"Animal and human figures have been a popular trend in Chinese cloisonné production since the mid-eighteenth century. These lively depictions gave new dimension to this traditional art form and added a playful touch to upscale interior spaces. Here, the brown and white enamels successfully mimic a water buffalo’s skin, together with the gilded cloisons representing its hair.

Monk’s cap ewer,China,early 15th century,"The form of this ewer comes from Tibetan metalwork; because the top reminded Chinese patrons of the hats worn by Tibetan monks, it was given the name “monk’s cap ewer” (sengmaohu). It is a tea container intended for use in Tibetan Buddhist rituals. Probably a gift for a prominent Tibetan cleric, this example is made of the exceptionally pure white porcelain of the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen.

Vase with lotus scrolls,China,15thC16th century,"Judging from the pattern style and translucent enamels, especially the dark purple, the central part of this vase was a jar from the second half of the fifteenth century. But the enamel over its trumpet-shaped neck and foot ring has a dull and grayish tone, likely from the late sixteenth century. It is not unusual to see such combination of parts from different periods when cloisonné came to be favored in the antique market.

The animals, along with this calendrical system, were also adopted by many other East Asian and Southeast Asian countries.As burial practices grew more elaborate, pottery animals wearing official robes became popular tomb offerings, presumably as symbols of renewal and regeneration.

This thangka has a Chinese inscription dating the work to the reign of the Wanli emperor (r. 1573C1619) of the Ming dynasty as well as Tibetan glosses identifying the scenes depicted. The presence of the glosses indicates that this thangka was made for a Tibetan client.

Buddha of Medicine Bhaishajyaguru (Yaoshi fo),China,ca. 1319,"Iconography:Bhaishajyaguru (A), the Buddha of Medicine, sits on a lotus throne surrounded by an assembly of deities. Standing to either side of the central figure are the Buddha’s attendant bodhisattvas: Candraprabha (B), or Yueguang Pusa 月光菩_, and Suryaprabha (C), or Riguang Pusa 日光菩_. They can be identified by the adjacent white moon and the red sun, respectively. Two larger bodhisattvas are seated to the right and left of the smaller standing figures. Two secondary bodhisattvas at lower left and lower right carry a monk’s staff and medicine bowl (D and E), Bhaishajyaguru’s traditional attributes. The Twelve Guardian Generals (F) are depicted at the two sides of the mural. They personify Bhaishajyaguru’s vow to help all in need by curing illness, ensuring the birth of healthy children, and providing clothing and other necessities.This painting was originally paired with an equally large image of Tejaprabha, the Buddha of Blazing Light, who controls the planets and constellations and, therefore, one’s fate. He is believed to bring good fortune and long life. The pairing of Bhaishajyaguru and Tejaprabha is unusual and may illustrate concerns fostered by the devastating earthquake and fire that destroyed the Guangsheng monastery complex in 1303.Technique and Style:This mural was painted on a ground of dry plaster mixed with straw and covered with clay. Thick black outlines define the images, which are filled in using vegetable and mineral pigments. Only the latter―predominantly red, green, and white―have survived. This is one of several murals from the Fen River area, in southern Shanxi province that are associated with the workshop of the early fourteenth-century master craftsman Zhu Haogu. A robust figure type with a full face and shallow spatial constrictions typify the style, found in both Buddhist and Daoist temple art.History:This representation of the Buddha of Medicine once adorned the east wall of the main hall in the Lower Guangsheng (“VastTriumph”) Temple, in the northern Chinese province of Shanxi. Rebuilt after an earthquake in 1303, the temple’s eastern compound is constructed along a north-south axis. The large entry gate leads into the front and main halls, which are connected by coveredwalkways. Used for assemblies and lectures, the main hall once contained paintings on its east, north, and west walls, as well asnumerous freestanding wooden sculptures of Buddhist deities. Records indicate that the hall was rebuilt and refurbished between1303 and 1319.A stele at the temple indicates that in the 1930s the monks sold four of the murals decorating the main hall in order to prevent its collapse after being damaged by an earthquake.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT227320.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42716

Arhats were thought to have achieved an advanced state of spiritual development, and were revered as protectors of Buddhism.Regarded as masterpieces of ceramic sculpture, for their size, naturalistic modeling, and the quality of their three-toned (sancai) glaze, they can be dated securely to the late tenth or eleventh century based on material discovered in 1983 at an ancient kiln site near Beijing.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP163966.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44799
Stele commissioned by Helian Ziyue (赫子),China,dated 544 (completed 2nd year of Wuding reign),"A decisive episode from the Sutra on the Discourse of Vimalakirti is given dramatic and complex treatment on the upper half of this stele. The scene (a debate) takes place in a windblown landscape, as indicated by the trees at center and in the background. Vimalakirti (Weimo) sits in a curtained and tasseled pavilion at right, attended by fourteen figures; Manjushri (Wenshu) is accompanied by thirty attendants. Standing to either side of the two trees at center are the monk Shariputra and a female figure, who together represent the scene's most dramatic moment: Shariputra transforms himself into a woman and then changes back to his original form to demonstrate the impermanence and irrelevance of gender or any other state of being―one of the main points of the sutra. This is also one of the many moments in which the learned Vimalakirti trounces the Bodhisattva of Wisdom.Above the debate scene, a Buddha sits in a columned niche attended by two bodhisattvas; below, two monks kneel to either side of an elaborate incense burner that is supported by a pair of caryatids. The two figures standing between the guardians and the censer-one holding a bird, the other a skull-are standard images in Chinese Buddhist sculpture and represent two Indian ascetics. The long and exceptionally abstruse inscription on the front of the stele indicates that it was commissioned by a devotional society headed by Helian Ziyue (ca. 501C573), who is shown kneeling just right of center in the upper row of figures.

Pagoda base with four Buddhas,China,ca. 560C75,"The construction of small, square, pagoda-like shrines appears to have begun in China during the Northern Qi period, and flourished through the Tang dynasty (618C907). Comparisons with other examples suggest that this shrine once stood on a square, possibly stepped, base and was capped by either a domed or tiered roof. Its exterior walls, marked by prominent entryways, enclose a pillar with four Buddhas; although they can no longer be accurately identified, they likely represented the Buddhas most important to Chinese practice during the sixth century. Each wall is capped by a lintel that bears representations of multiple seated Buddhas. Paired dragons fill the upper registers and guardians and lions (many now missing) protect the entryways.The shrine’s interior walls are carved with rows of multiple tiny Buddhas. Exhibiting variations in posture and clothing, they symbolize the immanence of many Buddhas in the cosmos. Numerous shrines of this type can be found in northeast China and are often associated with the remains of notable monks, indicating that they may have functioned as funerary monuments.

"Vaishravana, Guardian of Buddhism and Protector of Riches",Tibet,15th century,"Vaishravana is a complex Buddhist deity who embodies many strands of thought and belief. Tibetans understand him foremost as the premier of the four guardians of the cardinal directions (lokapalas), associated with the North. In this role he serves as a protector (dharmapala) of Buddhist law. Here we see Vaishravana seated on his snow-lion mount in a stormy atmosphere, accompanied by his generals, the eight Lords of the Horses (asvapati), each riding a storm cloud. Central is Vaishravana himself, dominant is scale and represented emerging from a tumultuous skyscape. He is dressed as a warrior-king in full battle armor with a patterned tunic suggestive of chain-mail armor, mounted with a large lozenge chest-plate with pearl-and-lotus medallion and Chinese-style lion-face protective lappets on the shoulders. Decorated high boots point to his Central Asian ancestral connections. This celebrated Tibetan deity is rarely represented outside of monastery mural programs, such as those seen at Shalu and Gyantse monasteries, in 14th and 15th century respectively.

Bowl with dragons amid waves,China,10th century,"In the West, the term “celadon” describes green-glazed ceramics. In China, stoneware with celadon glaze is classified by the name of the kiln where it was produced.

Female musician with lute,China,late 7th century,"Ensembles featuring female musicians often served as a musical bridge between elite and popular culture. As expert musicians, they were often musical innovators. Here, a small ensemble is shown (23.180.4C.7), clapping and playing the pipa, tongbo (small copper cymbals), and konghou (harp). The pipa is played in its original position, like an Arabic lute; its silk strings are plucked with a triangular plectrum. The construction and playing style resemble those of the biwa, a Japanese lute derived from the pipa. Today, the biwa maintains the use of a triangular plectrum, the West Asian plectrum guard, and the C-shaped sound holes seen on the instrument played by the musician here as well as on the jade belt featured in this case. The Chinese playing style changed during the chaotic Later Tang period (921C36), when the plectrum was discarded. The angular konghou harp, introduced at the end of the Han dynasty, was in decline at this time and had gone completely out of use by the end of the Tang.The highest-rated musicians at the Tang court performed seated, while the lower ranks played standing and were also treated less well in other respects.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP337805.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44801

Vase with archaistic design,China,14th century,"This finely cast vase resembles an ancient wine container illustrated in antiquarian catalogues. In keeping with its new function as a vase, however, its body has been elongated, and its cross section flattened.

One of a Pair of Vases with Dragon Handles,China,19th century,"Cloisonné is a technique for creating designs on metal whereby enclosures made from copper or bronze wire that has been bent or hammered into a desired pattern are filled with colored glass paste. Known as cloisons (French for ""partitions""), the enclosures are generally pasted or soldered onto the metal body. The glass paste, or enamel, is colored with metallic oxide and painted into the contained areas. The vessel is then fired, usually at a relatively low temperature, about 800 degrees centigrade. As enamels commonly shrink during firing, the process has to be repeated several times to fill the entire design. Once this process is completed, the surface of the vessel is burnished until the edges of the cloisons are visible.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/29_110_48_O1.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40705

Most remarkable are the transcriptions of an essay and ten poems that grace the sky and the rock faces. Collectively they relate a true story of strangers becoming friends across traditional class boundaries. A visiting official named Shang Ancun, known for his poems on local scenery, met two local scholars who presented their own poems on the subject, and friendship was born.

A Confucian temple is the central place to host various rites showing respect to Confucius and Confucianism, the core ideology in China for the past two thousand years. The original stele was inscribed by the famous calligrapher Yu Shinan (558C638) but is now long lost.

Double cup with mythical beasts,China,18th century,"The origin of this vessel, often called a “champion vase” in Western scholarship, remains unclear. It is possible that the term is a loose translation of the phrase yingxiong bei, or hero’s cup, a reference to the bird (ying) and bear (xiong) depicted on the front. The dragon-headed scroll pattern that covers the surface is based on imagery found during the Shang (ca. 1600C1046 B.C.) and Zhou (1054C256 B.C.) dynasties.

Vase with elephant-headed handles,China,14thC15th century,"This vase turns away from the dense decoration of archaistic bronzes yet conveys an antique look. The bladelike motifs derive from ancient ritual bronzes, but the long flaring neck and bulbous body are features of thirteenth- to fifteenth-century ceramics.

Square vase with archaic-style motifs (fangzun),China,14th century,"This vase exhibits a monumentality that belies its small size. Its square shape―most such vessels are round―further adds to its assertive presence, as does its crisply cast bold decor. Combining the decorative patterns of the Shang, Zhou, and Han periods (ca. 1600 BCEC220 CE), the vase conveys a hybrid style that distinguishes it as a “new antique” rather than either a faithful copy or a fake.

Animal Pen with Figures,China,1stCearly 3rd century,"This animal pen is populated with goats, tended to with one hand by a mother who cradles an infant in her other arm. It is typical of mingqi or ""spirit utensils"" that accompanied the deceased in burials of the Eastern Han dynasty (25C220 A.D.). Replicas of farm animals, utilitarian objects, and entertainers were believed to provide nourishment and amusement for the soul of the tomb occupant. The elevated structure serves as an architectural record of rustic buildings that would have been part of a large agricultural estate, and preserves in clay details of wooden design and construction―such as the low-pitched roof with a series of wood rafters flanging from a central beam―that have long since disintegrated above ground.The popularization of mingqi over the course of the Han dynasty (206 B.C.C220 A.D.) reflects dramatic changes in Chinese society, illustrating how power circulated beyond the imperial government and nobility to a broader bureaucratic class. In the early years of the Han, Confucianism emerged as the dominant philosophy and the empire became dependent on a class of scholar-officials. They desired gratification for themselves and their families in the afterlife and plentiful clay, fashioned into models ranging from crude earthenware to fine glazed stoneware, was the ideal medium for furnishing mingqi in burials across a swath of social strata.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT3800.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44322
Dish with Flowering Plum and Birds,China,14th century,"Flowering plums and birds, possibly magpies, a popular theme in the paining and poetry of the Southern Song dynasty (1279C1368), were understood as harbingers of spring, because the plum is one of the first blossoms to appear as winter ends.

Guardian Lion,China,mid-6th century,"One of a pair, this fierce guardian lion bares his fangs, crouches, and grips the platform underneath him with splayed claws. Pairs of stone lions have been found protecting Han-dynasty tombs (206 B.C.C220 A.D.) and they became more prevalent following the inclusion of lion iconography in Buddhist cave temples in northern China during the fifth and sixth centuries. Excavations of Northern Qi tombs have unearthed pairs of protective lions defending the entrance to the innermost chamber containing the coffin.This guardian lion's fully modeled body and rippling muscles is illustrative of Northern Qi sculpture, which was more rounded and naturalistic than the elongated and linear forms of the preceding Northern Wei (386C534) and Eastern Wei (534C550) dynasties. The stylized whorl pattern along the lion's shoulders is common on carvings in relief as well as sculptures in the round from this period. While the Northern Qi dynasty was brief and was supplanted by the Northern Zhou in 577, its sculptural achievements provided direction and inspiration for stone sculpture in the succeeding centuries when China was unified first under the Sui dynasty (581C618) and then under the Tang dynasty (618C906).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP372039.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49575

Emperor Xiaowen and his entourage worshipping the Buddha,China,ca. 522C23,"Together with a companion piece showing an empress and her attendants (now in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City), this depiction of an emperor and his entourage once adorned the Central Binyang Cave (also known as Cave 3) in the Longmen complex, near Luoyang, in Henan province. It was positioned centrally on the northeast wall between a group of protective semidivinities above and a narrative debate scene below. Xuanwu commissioned the construction of the Central Binyang Cave in honor of his father, the emperor Xiaowen (r. 471C99), and his mother, the dowager Wenzhou (d. 494); the emperor and empress in the reliefs are therefore believed to refer to his parents. A figure wearing court garments and holding a tasseled baton leads the procession. He is followed by a smaller figure wearing armor and another who stands before the emperor, holding an incense burner. The trees originally indicated the point at which the procession moved around a corner, from the north to the east wall. Several of the attendants hold lotuses or other flowers and offerings, and the entire procession can be understood as making offerings to the Buddhas in the cave, an act of merit making that would continue in perpetuity and improve the future lives of the participants.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP170138.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42707

Sadaksari-Lokeshvara Surrounded by Manifestations and Monks,Tibet,late 15th century,"This painting represents the “six-syllables form” of Avalokiteshvara, evoking the mantra om mani padme hum. As expounded by the fourteenth Dalai Lama, om denotes the impurities that impede spiritual awareness; mani (jewel) symbolizes the pathway lit by compassion; padme (lotus) defines the tool, wisdom; and hum the indivisible union of wisdom and method―so achieving the purity of body, speech, and mind of Buddhahood. This fundamental teaching is given expression in the purity of this representation of the highest embodiment of compassion. The Dalai Lama is understood to be an incarnation of this form of Avalokiteshvara. Conventionally represented in white, Sadaksari-Lokeshvara is gold here, the most radiant of colors. Surrounding him are bodhisattvas, an array of protectors, and a lineage of monks.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT5231.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/37800

Vase from a five-piece altar set,China,second half 18th century,"Cloisonné is the technique of creating designs on metal vessels with colored glass paste placed within enclosures made of copper or bronze wires, which have been bent or hammered into the desired patterns. Known as cloisons (French for ""partitions""), the enclosures are generally either glued or soldered onto the metal body. The glass paste, or enamel―which gets its color from metallic oxides―is painted into the contained areas of the design. The vessel is usually fired at a relatively low temperature, about 800 degrees Celsius. Enamels tend to shrink during firing, and the process is repeated several times to fill in the design. Once this process is completed, the surface of the vessel is rubbed until the edges of the cloisons are visible.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP242377.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40727

Dish,China,ca. 1600,"The basic form of the bowl, with a thin body, is derived from a Dutch press-metalwork prototype. The foliate rim, however, is a Chinese modification.

An Introduction to Square Word Calligraphy,Xu Bing,1994C96,"In the early 1990s, Xu began to develop a system for writing English called “square word calligraphy,” which organizes the letters of each English word into structures that resemble Chinese characters. One consequence of his project is that non-Chinese speakers can understand how Chinese characters are similarly composed of discrete phonetic and lexigraphic components. An Introduction to Square Word Calligraphy expands on the didactic potential of the new script by offering directions for how to prepare ink, hold a brush, and execute individual brushstrokes. In the process of deciphering Xu’s text, viewers break down cultural barriers. Square word calligraphy helps demystify the Chinese written language, making the pleasures of calligraphy available to a wider audience.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP147582_det.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73325

"Saddle, Saddle Pad, Stirrups, Rein, Stirrup Straps, Bit and Bridle, Breaststrap, Tassel, and Crupper",Tibetan,18thC19th century,"The central decorative feature of this intricate eighteenth- or nineteenth-centry Sino-Tibetan saddle is thekīrttimukha, or Face of Glory, a glowering mask that recurs in various forms throughout the religious ornament of Tibet, China, India, and Indonesia. According to one story, thekīrttimukhawas a lion-headed demon created by the supreme Hindu deity, Shiva, and served both as his doorkeeper and as a manifestation of his divine power. Thekīrttimukhamotif spread with the expansion of Hinduism and, like many other aspects of Hindu belief and art, was eventually incorporated into the Buddhist tradition and widely disseminated by it. In both religions it symbolizes the beneficence of dinive authority and protection from spiritual and physical dangers. Thekīrttimukhawas used ubiquitously as an auspicious sign to ward off evil.On the saddle thekīrttimukhaappears in the center of the large gilt-copper plaques mounted on the front and back, and also in the center of the uppermost pierced and chiseled iron border. It is surrounded by a rich array of equally meaningful sacred attributes, including, on the upper border, the triratna, or the Three Jewels. This symbol represents the triple foundation shared by all Buddhist sects: Buddha, the Enlightened One; dharma, his teachings; and sangha, the community of believers. Flanking the Three Jewels is the image of a dragon holding a pearl, a popular motif with roots in Taoist China. In Buddhism the pearl or single jewel stands for faultless purity and, therefor, the infallible truth of the religion's doctrine. The dragon acts as the jewel's heavenly guardian.In the center of the lower pierced border is thecintāma?i, or Wish-Granting Jewel, another example of the jewel motif frequently encountered in Buddhist art. It typically appears either as a cluster of elongated orbs or as a single tear-shaped sphere surrounded by an aureole of flames. Thecintāma?iis an augury of material prosperity and a symbol of the fulfillment of all wishes through the Buddha. The related concept of salvation attained through the teachings of the Buddha is represented by the pair of diminutive deer that flank thecintāma?iand refer to the Deer Park at Sarnath, near Benares, in northeastern India, where Siddhārtha Gautama was said to have preached his first sermon.The pierced borders of this saddle are reminiscent of Chinese metalwork but the embossed plaques call to mind the workmanship of eastern Tibet, suggesting perhaps that the saddle is composed of elements from both countries. The highly concentrated use of complementary religious symbols on a luxurious objects of this kind, however, was not unusual in the decorative arts of either imperial China or theocratic Tibet. The images can be appreciated individually, in the full depth of their meaning, or for their overall effect, simply as a compilation of talismanic ornament.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/DP124301.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/24291

The gilt-paper-wrapped thread woven into the fabric is uniquely Chinese, but the cloth’s narrow loom width is the same as that of many eighteenth-century European dress silks. This is surprising because most Chinese export silks were woven on wider looms. Perhaps such silks, masquerading as European products, were made to circumvent the English and French bans on imported Asian silks enacted at the turn of the eighteenth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ad/mobile-large/MFA-2009.4628_2.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/21114

"Figure, possibly the God of Wealth in His Military Aspect",China,late 17thCearly 18th century,"The tentative identification of this figure with the God of Wealth is based on the hat that he wears.

Double vessel with mythical beasts (champion vase),China,18thC19th century,"The term “champion vase,” which appears only in Western scholarship, refers to vessels that have two narrow vertical compartments connected by a carved mythical bird. It may be a loose translation of yingxiong bei, or hero’s cup, referring to the eagle (ying) and the bear (xiong) upon which such vessels stand. Based on an archaic bronze vessel type that can be traced back to the second century B.C., champion vases were revived beginning in the sixteenth century and were manufactured in the following centuries in different media, including jade, cloisonné enamel, and rhinoceros horn.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP158046.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44247
Disc with Auspicious Images,China,late19thCearly 20th century,"Deer and cranes are ubiquitous Chinese motifs symbolic of good wishes, as is the pine tree in the center of this plaque. Similar themes are reiterated in two of the inscriptions. The inscription written on a banner suspended at the lower left is the name of an antiques shop active in Beijing in the late nineteeth and early twentieth centuries; that at the upper right records the Chinese name of E. Farago, a custom's officer who was influential at the court of the Guangxu Emperor (r. 1871C1908).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/29_110_89_F_sf.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40742
Wrapping cloth,China,19th century,"Wrapping cloth was used to bundle material for carrying and was popular in East Asia before the introduction of the modern backpack. Resist- and stencil-dyed patterns of two pairs of stylized badgers hugging each other appear on opposite corners. The Chinese word for “badger” (huan) is pronounced the same as the word for “happiness.” Two badgers, therefore, symbolize double happiness, a common pun in Chinese art.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-14150-018.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/70331

"Seated Buddha, probably Shakyamuni (Shijiamouni)",China,late 4thCearly 5th century,"Representations of the Buddha wearing a thick shawl over both shoulders and sitting atop a throne with lions on either side are Chinese adaptations of images derived from the northwest region of the Indian subcontinent, particularly from areas in present-day Pakistan (known as Gandhara in the ancient world). Scientific examination of this sculpture has shown that it was cast using several ceramic molds, a technique that was also used to create the ancient bronze ritual vessels on view in this gallery. By the fifth century, the lost-wax method, which may have been introduced with Buddhism, was used more often for the casting of Chinese sculptures.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-15581-062.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/61820
"Plate with Monkey, Bees, Magpie, and Deer",China,late 17thCearly 18th century,"Visual puns, often made by using homophones, are a popular design language in Chinese art. In addition to being a zodiac animal, the monkey also symbolizes a noble title, because it is pronounced the same as the word for marquis (hou) in Chinese. Here, monkey, bees, magpie, and deer are combined to convey “giving great wealth and bestowing a noble title” (jue lu feng hou).

Scroll Cover with Birds and Flowers,China,12th century,"Some of the earliest preserved examples of Chinese tapestry survived as covers for paintings. This piece came into the Museum’s collection as the cover for the handscroll Dragon Boat Regatta on Jinming Lake after Wang Zhenpeng (ca. 1280C1329). Using such a precious textile in this way both highlighted the importance of the painting and enhanced viewing, as opening the cover and unrolling the enclosed painting were part of the total experience. The type of weft used to make this piece along with the rendering of the motif of birds in flowers show Central Asian influence. However, the balance and precision of the design are typically Chinese, as is the magic fungus held in the birds’ beaks. The cuteness and intentional awkwardness (zhuo) of the scene are important aesthetic values in traditional Chinese art.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT4780.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39728

Box with Landscape Scenes and Auspicious Emblems,China,18thCearly 19th century,"This box is a quintessential example of the intricate layered surfaces that characterize carved lacquer in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. On the lid a geometric background supports a stylized Chinese character for shou, or longevity, which is itself decorated with auspicious motifs such as bats (the Chinese word for which is a homonym for ""good fortune""). The four raised black-lacquer panels on the side of the box are carved with scenes of deer and cranes-both symbolic of longevity-in landscapes. They are surrounded by lush clouds that contain the Eight Treasures: a conch shell, a lotus wheel, a parasol, an endless knot, a pair of golden fish, a banner, and a treasure vase. These auspicious symbols, derived from Buddhism, appear often in later Chinese art. Boxes of this shape were used to hold small treasures of various materials and are therefore frequently referred to as treasure boxes.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/81_1_611ab_TQ.JPG,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/60903
Ritual staff,China,未知年代,"The elaborate decoration on this ritual staff employs the technique of damascening, in which the iron surface is first cross-hatched and then filled with soft gold and silver foils.

The Song of Wandering Aengus by William Butler Yeats,Xu Bing,1999,"Words, books, and calligraphy form central elements of Xu’s work, which often questions the effectiveness of written communication. In this piece, Xu challenges the high-art status of calligraphy within the Chinese cultural tradition while also blurring the linguistic and cultural boundaries between East and West. Xu’s transcription does not retain Yeats’s original format of three eight-line stanzas. Instead, he has divided the poem into two sheets and recomposed the words to resemble Chinese characters. The text is read vertically (as in traditional Chinese texts) and from left to right (as in Western texts). The poem, which ends with the lines “The silver apples of the moon, / The golden apples of the sun,” is from Yeats’s 1899 collection The Wind among the Reeds and reflects his early fascination with the occult.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/Fig  32_Xu Bing_Song of Wandering Aengus.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73326

Three seated luohans,China,16thC17th century,"Not all images of luohans depict them as exotic, superhuman beings.

Taking a Rest,Wang Bingguo,1930s and 1940s,"The Modern Woodcut Movement is an important but understudied chapter in the history of twentieth-century Chinese art. The movement was initiated by Lu Xun (1881C1936), the father of modern Chinese literature and an incisive cultural critic, who saw woodcut as the ideal medium for rousing what he saw as a complacent China from its slumber to face up to the challenges of the modern world. Easily produced from inexpensive materials and with relatively limited training, woodcut was seen as a counterpoint to the precious erudition of literati landscape painting. The medium was used extensively during the 1930s and ‘40s―by both Communist and Nationalist leaders―to disseminate political messages in a graphically impactful, legible form. Some of the most iconic vignettes from the War of Resistance (against Japan, 1937C45) and the Chinese Civil War (1945C49) were produced in this medium. The current set of prints were produced in the Communist milieu―at Yan’an, the mountain stronghold in northern Shaanxi Province that served as the capital of the Communist government during the 1940s.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-26920-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/892925

Textiles with such patterns have been found at archaeological sites all over China, including in the far west, and were often referred to in contemporary documents by complete or partial inscriptions.

The stripes, probably dyed with cinnabar, retain a fresh red color. Cinnabar was mined in China as early as three to four thousand years ago and has been found in Late Neolithic tombs. By the time of the Western Zhou dynasty (ca. 1046C771 B.C.), the Chinese were refining and processing it to obtain the very best red color.

Horse and rider,China,early 8th century,"In style and subject matter, this horse and rider with sancai or ""three-color"" glaze is emblematic of funerary sculpture from the early eighth century, the apex of the Tang dynasty. Free-form splatters and drips of colored glaze were first experimented with in the sixth century and the sancai glazes, made by mixing copper, iron, and cobalt to create a lively spectrum of blues, greens, ambers, and yellows over a milky white background, became fashionable in the early Tang for funerary, utilitarian, and export wares. The distribution of glaze on this horse and rider displays a relative degree of control. The colors clarify, rather than obscure, steed, saddle, boot, tunic, and hood. Swift brushstrokes in black detail the rider's brow and mustache, as well as the saddle blanket and horse's eyes, while etched lines stress the animal's musculature.The horse itself was a potent image during the vigorous expansion of the Tang ""golden age."" Chargers such as this large horse were both the reward of military incursions to the west, and the foundation of imperial stability that would in turn encourage trade and prosperity over a vast empire. The most sought-after steeds were known as ""blood-sweating horses""; raised in the western kingdom of Ferghana, they were sent in great numbers as tribute to the emperor. Horses also were a sign of wealth: strict sumptuary laws limited the use of the horses to people of a certain rank and even those serving in the military, such as the hooded soldier saluting from astride this horse, had to provide their own mount.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT328118.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44805

Bounded by Mountains: Mount Hua,Michael Cherney,2005C6,"This album of twelve images was created from a digital scan of a single frame of 35mm film shot while the artist was visiting Mount Hua, the sacred mountain of the west, in winter 2005. Through the subjective and selective process of cropping, the resulting series of images mimics the sense of shifting perspective often depicted in traditional Chinese landscape paintings. Cherney was inspired by theearly-Ming dynasty painter Wang Lü (ca. 1332C1395), who is most famous for his album of scenic studies of Mount Hua and for having advocated the study of nature over that of earlier painting styles in order to achieve realism. The label strip on Cherney's wood album cover bears a seal with a legend that quotes Wang: ""My eye takes Mount Hua as its teacher.""But Cherney reverses Wang's creative process: by enlarging and fragmenting a panoramic vista of the mountain, he transforms objective realism, as captured by the camera lens, into tonal abstraction. Although born and raised in the United States, Michael Cherney has adopted a Chinese name (Qiu Mai) and, in recent years, has been exploring processes that honor traditional Chinese materials, mounting techniques, and subject matter. This work is from his series of printed albums entitled Bounded by Mountains, all produced in a format that combines the technologies of photography, digital printing, and traditional craftsmanship.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP143654.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73601
Embroidered Patchwork Panel,China,ca. 14th century,"This patchwork panel comprises various silk textiles, mostly satins and damasks, exquisitely embroidered with the motifs of flowers, fruit, and the occasional butterfly in a technique called needle looping. Worked in silk over gilt paper, the technique allows the luminous gold to show where loops are intentionally skipped. The patches in this Chinese example seem to have been constructed and embroidered as self-contained units that were stitched together to form a larger panel. By contrast, Korean patchwork cloths are usually fashioned from fragments of unadorned, rather than embroidered fabrics, though there are non-patchwork bojagi fashioned from a single cloth with embroidered decoration.This textile was probably used in a Buddhist context but its precise function is unknown. A comparable example, traditionally associated with the Chinese monk Wuxue Zuyuan (1226C1286), resides in the collection of the Buddhist temple Engakuji in Kamakura, Japan.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/ASA95.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39712
Immortal,China,18th century,"This pair of figures (with 2015.500.1.12) depicts two young attendants holding large serving bowls. Their unusually large earlobes, quiet expressions with subtle smiles, and long robes with broad sleeves all suggest that they are from the land of the immortals.

Brick with Fu Xi and Nu? Wa,China,未知年代,"Fu Xi and Nü Wa played multiple roles in ancient Chinese history and mythology, always occurring as a pair. Nu?Wa’s legend may derive from China’s purported matriarchal past. She is crucial to the myth of creation: after the pillars of Heaven collapsed, she mended the sky by melting stones of five colors and fashioned humans from the yellow earth. For his part, Fu Xi invented nets for fishing and hunting, and he designed the hexagrams, later used in the Yi Jing (Book of Changes), a Confucian classic.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_4_6_002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640972

An exotic bird to the Chinese, the peacock was cherished for its beautiful feathers and is connected with fairies or spirits in Chinese legends.This type of garment is often characterized as an arhat robe (luohanyi), and it is believed that it would have been worn to play the role of a sacred monk in dramas based on Buddhist history.

Lion,China,未知年代,"Lions were introduced to China from ancient Persia and India, thereafter capturing the Chinese imagination. Large stone sculptures of lions soon lined the “spirit paths” leading to the tombs of royals and aristocrats, and they became standard elements flanking entrances to government offices and private residences alike. The present example is largely missing its legs, but remnants of its limbs, together with its burly chest and taut haunches, suggest that it originally assumed a striding posture.

Multiarmed, powerful tantric forms of Avalokiteshvara were introduced into East Asia by the monk Amoghavajra as part of an eighth-century effort to repel Tibet’s military expansion across Central Asia. Later, this protective form of Avalokiteshvara, who is able to aid his numerous devotees with his many arms, became especially popular in Tibet after the north Indian monk Atisha (980C1054) emphasized this tantric deity.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP170186.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49567
Amphora with dragon-shaped handles,China,ca. late 7thCfirst half of 8th century,"Owing to their large oval bodies and narrow cylindrical necks, vessels of this type have traditionally been called ""amphorae"" and were said to be based on the ancient Greek jar with essentially the same contours. Recently, however, it has been suggested that the shape is derived from Roman glass and metalwork that came to China over the Silk Road.

Wine container (hu),China,5thC4th century BCE,"This ritual wine container with exquisite inlaid decoration illustrates a major innovation in China’s bronze tradition in the late Eastern Zhou dynasty (770C256 BCE) when, inspired by the nomadic art of the steppes, Chinese craftspeople applied sumptuous surface decor to otherwise austere bronzes.

Vessel in the shape of a leather wrapper,China,11th to 12th century,"This exceedingly rare, if not unique, piece not only represents a cross-medium artistic exchange, but also a cultural exchange between Chinese and northern nomadic peoples during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The unusual shape and brownish color suggest that it was intended to mimic a leather wrapper or parcel that would have been a common accoutrement of nomadic culture. The two rectangular holes cut into the top surface may have originally held a ribbon handle. The white porcelain body and brown iron glaze identify it as coming from Ding County (Hebei), which was the most important center of white porcelain production during the eleventh century. Located close to the border between the Chinese Song state and the nomadic Khitan Liao kingdom, this kiln site served both Chinese and nomadic patrons. After 1127, when the semi-nomadic Jurchen peoples conquered the northern portion of Song China, this county entered the territory of the Jin dynasty. It is very likely that this vessel’s distinctive leather-like form was commissioned by a Khitan or Jurchen patron.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-28520-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/894294

A braid made of gold threads extends between the borders and the design, composed on connected trefoils extending into the corners with a circle at the center.Technically and stylistically, these plaques are typical of ornaments found at seventh- and eighth-century sites in eastern Central Asia and in the northwestern Chinese province of Qinghai. Chinese sources indicate that metalworking flourished in this region under Tibetan dominion during the seventh and eighth centuries.

Panel with birthday celebration,China,19th century,"This tapestry is part of a set of large ornamental panels. Among the guests honoring the elderly couple are several lively children, probably their grandsons. The man and his wife wear matching robes, appropriate dress for court officials and their wives. As a birthday gift, the three boys at their feet present a hanging scroll bearing the character for longevity (shou) in blue, surrounded by five red bats (fu).

Table valance with phoenix,China,18th century,"In a traditional Chinese reception hall, chairs for the hosts are set in pairs on either side of a central table and are covered with textiles that are not adhered directly onto the furniture.

Arhat (Luohan),China,16thC17th century,"This sculpture epitomizes the merging of religious and secular imagery in later Chinese Buddhist sculpture. With his shaven head and elongated earlobes, the figure resembles a luohan (one of the Indian disciples of the Buddha), but his refined facial features, dignified posture, long-sleeved robe, and pointed shoes―all attributes associated with Confucian scholar-officials―identify him unmistakably as a youthful monk.The sculpture’s tendency toward abstraction and stylization―the contours of the head, body, and robes are conveyed through the buildup of simple, curved forms―recall thirteenth-century images, but a radiocarbon date suggests that the piece dates to between A.D. 1324 and 1617.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP164044.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44613
Fan with Landscape,China,18th century,"Although at first glance this fan appears to have been painted, the landscape was actually delicately embroidered with fine silk thread. The inscriptions reiterate the imagery of mountains and pines, both symbols of longevity in Chinese culture.

Peach-shaped Cup with Saucer,China,19th century,"According to myth, Xiwangmu, the queen mother of the west, had an orchard producing peaches that granted immortality, and the peach thus became a symbol of long life. The outer surface of this peach-shaped cup features a branch with leaves and blossoms, giving the impression that the fruit is still attached to an otherworldly tree.

Box with camellias,China,13th century,"The lacquer body is built on a red-orange ground and has a thin layer of lacquer near the top that outlines the camellia blossoms and leaves in red, an allusion to the color of this flower that blooms around the Chinese New Year.

Dish with immortals playing weiqi,China,1425C1436,"Lotus-shaped dishes like this one were produced primarily during the short reign of the Xuande emperor.

One of a Pair of Vases with Dragon Handles,China,19th century,"The dragons in the four openwork cartouches on this vase are strikingly similar to those found on the robes in this gallery and illustrate the ubiquitous sharing of motifs that characterizes Chinese art in the Qing dynasty. This vase was most likely part of a set that included another vase, incense burner, and candlesticks, which would be displayed in public rooms and on ancestral altars. This vase is designed to be rotated on its base, a technical embellishment that is also (rarely) found in porcelain but has no true function.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/29_110_49_O1.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40706
Wrist Rest with Scene from "The West Chamber",China,dated to either 1674 or 1734,"The motif of a woman reading a letter is most likely based on a woodblock print illustrating a scene from a fourteenth-century play known as either The West Chamber or The Romance of the West Chamber. This play, which tells of the convoluted romance between a young scholar and a beautiful woman, is one of the most well known in Chinese history, and allusions to some of its more famous moments are often found in the visual arts.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP302904.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73223
Cup with character for longevity (shou),China,early 17th century,"Cups like this one reflect the seventeenth-century Japanese taste for Chinese porcelain. They also reflect a change in Japanese tea culture brought about by ōbaku monks from China, who arrived with a new form of tea that was popular on the continent. Unlike traditional powdered tea, whisked in deep bowls, the new tea (called sencha in Japan) was brewed by steeping whole, unfermented leaves in pots and served in small cups. In size, form, and aesthetic, this cup would have been perfectly suited to Japanese sencha practice.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-18146-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/48020
"Box with gardenia, plum blossoms, and finches",China,late 16thCearly 17th century,"The technique of combining fine basketry weaving with Chinese lacquer first appeared in the late sixteenth century. Basketry panels were installed on the sides of lacquer containers that were used to present gifts and important documents. The colorful painting of birds and flowers on this cover probably came from a pattern book, as multiblock color printing became popular in southern China in the same period.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP256075.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40266
Dish with the Three Friends of Winter,China,16thCearly 17th century,"Pine needles, bamboo leaves, and plum blossoms fill the center of this deeply carved dish. Plum blossoms, which are among the first flowers of early spring, are often associated in Chinese art with evergreen pine and bamboo. Together, the trio are known as the “Three Friends of Winter,” a motif symbolizing how a lofty individual perseveres even in the harshest environment.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP256021.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40223
Textile fragment with boys and birds in pomegranates,China,10th century,"This strip of silk features two clusters of pomegranates and leaves. The fruits, which are known for their many seeds, are filled with birds and flowers at the top, while those at the bottom hold boys and flowers. The inclusion of boys inside the pomegranates may refer to offspring: the Chinese character for “seed” is the same as that for “son.”",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/260080.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39743
Box with chi dragons amid clouds,China,13th century,"Known as chi, the feline dragons that curve along the surface of this box were inspired by comparable creatures found on Bronze Age vessels, which were rediscovered during the Song dynasty and often reinterpreted in the arts of that period. Although they lack the large horns, prominent snouts, and scaled body of the typical Chinese depiction of the dragon, chi dragons are also regarded as auspicious and protective.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP222094.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40208
Textile with confronted birds,China,early 8th century,"Although symmetry is a basic element of Chinese design, the motif of a pair of confronted animals or birds on either side of a plant was not known in China until the opening of the silk routes in the second century B.C.

Box with Pommel Scroll Design,China,14th century,"The lush spirals carved into the lacquer illustrate a design commonly known as “pommel scroll” because the bracket-like shapes resemble the pommel of a Chinese sword. This motif was popular in lacquer, ceramics, and metalwork in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and remained so in carved lacquer, as both a primary subject and as a decorative embellishment, for centuries.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP256110.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40189
Chimera (Bixie) (a); magnifying glass (b),China,1st century (a); 20th century (b),"Miniature depictions of animals began to appear in the middle of the Han dynasty. The perforation in the body of this solid gold chimera suggests that it was worn as a pendant or perhaps as one of several “beads.” Such ornaments are likely to have been inspired by small animal-shaped hardstone beads that were imported from South and Southeast Asia. Hardstone beads have been discovered in Han royal tombs in many Chinese provinces. They have also been excavated from contemporary sites along the coast of Vietnam and Thailand as well as in source countries including northern Pakistan, and Afghanistan.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-18894-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/61736
Lozenge-Shaped Dish with Garden Scene,China,late 16thC17th century,"Chinese literati enjoying gardens became a common subject in the art of the late Ming period. Artists typically included stock figures based on woodblock prints, such as the musicians gathered in the pavilion on this dish.

In the foreground, three such men, identifiable by their clothing, travel on horseback toward a gate attended by two figures holding large fans. The trio in the middle ground examines a painting displayed by a pair of young attendants.

Box with “peach-blossom grotto”,China,late 14thCmid-15th century,"Three Chinese characters incised on a rectangular piece of shell at upper right identify the scene on this box as the “peach-blossom grotto” (tao yuan dong). The phrase refers to a famous poem by Tao Qian (365C427) in which a fisherman enters a grotto and stumbles upon Shangri-la.

Traveling box with lotus scrolls,China,early 15th century,"This extraordinary box, most likely made for a Tibetan visitor to the Chinese court, would have been used to carry belongings, both personal goods and gifts such as porcelains and textiles. The large lotus scrolls painted on the sides, and in particular the spiky blossoms, derive from Nepali artistic traditions that were introduced to China in the late thirteenth century.

Skirt from Theatrical Ensemble for a Female Role,China,18th century,"A close look at this colorful design of phoenixes amid scrolling vegetation reveals transformations in the pattern: some of the flowering areas have heads.

Lamp in the Shape of a Seated Man,China,未知年代,"This sturdy man in a rigid seated posture boasts thick eyebrows, large eyes, a high nose bridge, and a full beard, distinguishing him as non-Chinese. He is sometimes described as being naked because of the curved contour lines visible on the body, but two incised lines around his neck may represent the collar of a thin garment.

Large Roof Tile End,China,未知年代,"Tile ends are a decorative and functional component of traditional Chinese architecture. The example here is believed to have appeared at the end of a rooftop. The geometric relief pattern represents one of the two known decorative programs for such tiles.

Pouring Vessel (Kendi) with Flowers and Fruits,China,late 16th century,"Chinese manufacture of this drinking vessel with a long neck and a spout, known as kendi (a Malay word), began during the fourteenth century for export to Muslim communities in Southeast Asia. By the sixteenth century it was carried farther afield to the Middle East, where Persian copies were made. This late sixteenth-century version, not necessarily made for export to Europe, is decorated in patterns that commonly were applied to kraak porcelain.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-14606-007.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42210
Pillow in the Shape of a Twin-Headed Bird,China,未知年代,"Stuffed with plant stalks, this pillow features a pattern of stylized birds and beasts. Interspersed are Chinese characters reading, “extend years, increase longevity, and benefit sons and grandsons.” The two tips forming bird’s heads have led to the pillow’s identification as a “rooster-crowing pillow” (jimingzhen), a burial item intended to carry the deceased into heaven, but no historical texts of the period can corroborate the term. The two-headed form more likely represents a mythical bird than an actual rooster.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_22_4_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696821
Box with Lid,China,2nd century BC,"Each half of this box resembles a phiale, a type of lobed bowl from Achaemenid Persia (550C330 B.C.) that was common in western Asia during the Hellenistic period (323C31 B.C.), a time of frequent exchange between the Parthians and the Greeks. While the hammering technique points to a Persian origin, the combination of two bowls into a lidded box is found in neither the Iranian nor the Greek world.

Unarmored General,China,未知年代,"This unarmored figure can be identified as a military officer by his size (larger than most) and headdress (a distinctive cap split into two folded peaks). The cap may refer to the “pheasant’s-tail cap” recorded in Chinese historical texts, in which case two feathers would have been inserted at the back. Such caps became customary adornment for military officers, owing to the pheasant’s combative nature. It is still uncertain which of the figures’ features indicate their ranks and responsibilities, though the bows on the armors of some terracotta generals are speculated to signal rank.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_23_2ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640794
Lamp in the Shape of a Mythical Bird,China,未知年代,"This lamp, typical of southern Chinese bronzes, demonstrates a design innovation particular to the Han, a form of hollow-bodied lamp known as gang (literally, “hollow”). Smoke emitted from the lit fuel would enter the lamp via a point of ingress―in this case, the mouth and neck of the bird (likely a phoenix or a peacock)―and accumulate in the hollow inner body, which usually contained water. The smoke was therefore contained, and would not prove a nuisance to those nearby.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_17_9ac_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696845
Dish with two boys,China,16th century,"Scenes of boys at play, which originated in the Song period (960C1279), are common in Chinese decorative arts. They express the wish for offspring and the joy of having them.

Textile Fragment with “Longevity” Design,China,2nd century BC,"This fragment is meticulously embroidered with a stylized cloud pattern in four colors: pink, orange, green, and blue. The vivid patterns express the ancient Chinese ideology of immortality. The inventory of the tomb’s burial goods, written on bamboo strips, records this type of textile as a “longevity embroidery” (changshou xiu), providing sound evidence of the Han-period name for this decorative motif.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_3_12_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696720
Pair of dishes with scenes from Romance of the Three Kingdoms,China,late 14th century,"The narrative scenes on this pair of dishes probably derive from woodblock-print illustrations of the popular Chinese historical novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo Yanyi).

Robe for Tibetan aristocrat (chuba),Tibet,18th century,"In addition to bolts of cloth, court robes were often sent from China to Tibet in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries where they were refitted into a style of dress worn by lay aristocrats. Close examination of the dragons on the upper part of this robe reveals that parts of their bodies do not match precisely, which suggests that this garment was either made from a larger one or pieced together from different robes.

Chasuble,"China, for European, possibly Spanish, market",late 18th century or early 19th century,"This deep red satin chasuble was embroidered in China. Its slender, A-line shape was common in chasubles of eighteenth-century Spain, where it may have been used.[1]The focal point of the embroidered design is the roundel with a double-headed eagle at the center of the vestment’s front and back. Although the double-headed eagle surmounted by a crown was a symbol of the Habsburg monarchy, here it is purely decorative and tinged with an auspicious Chinese flavor.[2] Instead of grasping arrows in their talons, as they would in the Habsburg motif, the birds dangle flowering and leafy stems from their beaks. In Chinese textiles auspicious birds frequently hold symbolic flora: a rank badge in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection features a crane that grips a branch bearing both a peach and a peach blossom.[3]The front and back of the chasuble are each divided into three vertical sections, separated by narrow embroidered floral trim that also borders the neck and edges.[4] The central section consists of a series of vertically aligned roundels, floral rosettes, and geometrically decorated vessels resting on stands amid a simple ogival pattern of flowering vines. On each of the two side sections, a graceful design of delicately curving leafy stems emerges from a multicolored cornucopia, a long-standing European motif. Cornucopias are included in at least two other eighteenth-century chasubles embroidered in China, one now in the Metropolitan and the other in the Museo Nacional del Virreinato, Tepotzotlan, Mexico, and formerly in the Catedral de Mexico―a reminder that there were markets besides Europe for chasubles embroidered in China.[5]The scrolling pattern of the side panels is punctuated with large flowers, some of which include elements from Chinese decorative arts and others that are unusual from a Chinese perspective―even quite fantastic. The large flowers close to the cornucopias on the front of the garment and flanking the eagle roundel on the back are rather unrefined in technique, featuring dots on their radiating petals and a bold red, white, yellow, and blue coloration that lacks the more subtle shades of light red seen in the smaller flowers nearby, a customary coloration in Chinese embroidery. As dotted petals are fairly common in Indian floral textiles of the eighteenth century but unusual in Chinese examples, these bold flowers and other similarly distinctive blooms may reflect the Chinese embroiderer’s attempt to mimic the Indian floral patterns that were so popular in international trade.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]Footnotes1.

Several bronzes similar to this one were catalogued as “heavenly rooster vessels” (tianjizun) in the collection of Emperor Qianlong (r. 1736C95), who had a deep interest in antiquarianism.

The graphic quality of the design is achieved through differences in the reflectivity of the two surfaces on the face of the velvet. The background is rendered in cut pile, which tends to absorb light, while the pattern consists of uncut loops, which are more reflective.

A dragon head emerges from the vessel and bites through the ropes. The tripod begins to sink back into the river under the gaze of the large figures on top, one of whom is probably the emperor.

Pair of Belt Plaques with Winged Horses,Unidentified artist,1st century,"Unlike the ornaments favored by the Xiongnu, few plaques or other adornments used by the Xianbei are known. Gilt plaques embellished with images of flying horses similar to these have been excavated at sites on the Manchurian plain in northeast China; however, it is rare for a pair with facing horses to survive.The name Xianbei refers to a confederation of tribes that spoke different languages and came from varying regions. Originally part of the Xiongnu empire, the Xianbei broke away and resumed control of their lands in the mid-first century B.C. From that time until the sixth century A.D., they played a complicated role in Central Asian and Chinese history. The Xianbei ruled many of the small states that vied for control of North China from the third to the mid-fifth century. The Tuoba, a subsidiary branch of the eastern Xianbei, established the powerful Northern Wei dynasty that ruled North China from the mid-fourth to the mid-sixth century.The first chapter of the Wei Shu (History of the Wei), written in the mid-sixth century by the Chinese historian Wei Shou, preserves most of what little is known about the Tuoba prior to the establishment of the Northern Wei dynasty (386C534). According to this source, a mysterious animal spirit that was shaped like a horse and bellowed like an ox led the Tuoba south on the perilous journey from their homeland in Heilongjiang Province (in the far northeast of China) over the Daxing'an Range and into the Inner Mongolian plain.

"?ikhin, one of the Buddhas of the past",Unidentified artists,dated 1777,"In 1777, the Panchen Lama, high cleric of Tibet’s Tashilhunpo Monastery, sent a gift of seven paintings to the Qianlong emperor, each of which depicted one of the Buddhas of the past. As a sign of respect for this gift, Qianlong had them recreated in several forms: as polychrome paintings, as stone carvings, as rubbings of those stone carvings, and finally as paintings in gold on deep blue paper. This thangka, which depicts ?ikhin, second of the seven Buddhas of the past, survives from a set of this final form, which transmutes the stark white on black visual idiom of the rubbing into a luxurious, shimmering gold on midnight blue. The painting is inscribed with a hymn in praise of ?ikhin, which is rendered in the four official languages of the Qing court: Chinese, Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan. The poem reads:Hymn to ?ikhinThat which arises from good factors is fundamentally illusory;That which creates evil karma, too, is fundamentally illusory.With a body [ephemeral] like accumulated foam and a heart [diffuse] like wind,He casts out illusions, which are rootless and without reality.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-18765-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/828440
Buddha Maitreya (Mile) altarpiece,China,undated，ca. 525C30,"Maitreya is the only divinity in Buddhism revered as both a bodhisattva and a Buddha.

The mournful expression of the face of the Virgin, the clasped hands, and the seated position are typical of representations of the mourning Madonna (mater dolorosa), an image of the Virgin Mary that represents her sorrows during the sufferings of her Son, a theme that was popular in music and ritual during the eighteenth century.

The surface design is also an allusion to the rare, imperial Ru ware of the Northern Song dynasty (960C1127), revered for the lush crackle in its glaze.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP323428.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/52683
Ritual Wine Vessel (Jiao),China,late 11th century BCE,"This elaborate set of wine vessels provides an idea of the splendor of Shang and early Zhou ritual ceremonies. The set is said to have come from a tomb uncovered in 1901; shortly thereafter, it entered the collection of Duan Fang, a senior Manchu official and one of the preeminent antiquarians of the late Qing period.The pieces vary in style and execution. Although eleven of the vessels are inscribed, only one grouping shares identical inscriptions: the two wine containers, or you (nos. 2, 3) and the tall wine container, or zun (no. 4). A second grouping has largely comparable inscriptions: the spouted water vessel, or he (no. 5) and one cup, or zhi (no. 11).A partial reconstruction of the set’s arrangement in the tomb may be established from corrosion outlines on the three principal vessels―the two wine containers, or you, and the central tall wine container, or zun―that were etched onto the surface of the altar table. The diagram shows a hypothetical arrangement of the remaining vessels around the major pieces. Even if this is accepted as the original grouping, the disparate inscriptions and vessel styles remain unexplained. Created around the time of the Zhou conquest of the Shang, and clearly by different foundries, the pieces of the set may represent the accumulated wealth of a family shrine.青~禁1.

Camel with Dionysian imagery on its saddle bags,China,late 6thC7th century,"This pottery model of a Bactrian camel may be a rare example of a Chinese-style tomb figure produced in eastern Central Asia. The identity of the central figure on the packboards is uncertain. He may represent the Indian Kubera, king of the yakshas, who is portrayed in drinking scenes being waited on by women. However, the full beard and absence of headgear are unusual in depictions of Kubera. Another interpretation of the scene is that the three figures were inspired by representations of the Descent from the Cross, an important theme in early Christian iconography that may have been transmitted along the Silk Road.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-343-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/53630

Various silks were used: silk strips to suggest the volume of the folds in his garment and couched silk cords to delineate the lion’s mane and tail.

Such “imperfections” were intentionally created to achieve a natural, even a humble aesthetic effect that was highly appreciated by Japanese tea masters. A bowl like the current piece would have functioned as a serving dish for sweets offered at an upscale tea ceremony.

Vase with gentlemen in a landscape (one of a pair),China,ca. 1915C35,"Early in the twentieth century, under the auspices of Yuan Shikai, some ceramics of surprisingly fine quality were produced at the Jingdezhen kilns of Jiangxi Province. Yuan had been named president of the Chinese Republic in 1912, and his ambitions to become emperor were realized in December 1915, when he ""accepted"" the throne. His reign was short-lived, however, as he died in June 1916.This pair of vases (with 68.4.2) have mirror-image designs that have been painted over the glaze in sepia and black pigments with minute attention to detail. They are marked on the base with Yuan Shikai's reign title, Hongxian, and they stand as proof of a degree of excellence in ceramic manufacture that is generally unexpected in wares of this period.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP261021.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42322

Buddha Amitabha Descending from his Pure Land,Unidentified artist,13th century,"This painting, traditionally ascribed by Japanese scholars to a Song Buddhist painter named Zhang Sigong, represents the Buddha Amitabha (J.: Amida) welcoming souls into his Western Paradise. The drapery of the robe is drawn in the ""scudding-cloud and running-water"" style, a drapery pattern the Chinese used to recall the Indian origin of the Buddha image.Infrared reflectography has revealed the following traces of an inscription in the lower left corner: ""Qingyuanfu, east of Washing Horse Bridge. . . ."" Since the name of the city of Ningbo was changed from Mingzhou to Qingyuanfu in 1195 and to Qingyuanlu in 1277, the painting may be dated to between 1195 and 1277. Stylistically, this work appears to date from the end of the twelfth or the beginning of the thirteenth century: the figure is extremely well drawn, with fine lines firmly describing the splendid face and hands of the image in a fully three-dimensional manner. An almost identical Buddha appears in one of the Daitokuji Five Hundred Luohans paintings, also made in Ningbo and dated 1178.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP222080.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40282

The otherworldly atmosphere is further enhanced by the meandering clouds that encircle the crest of the mountain.

Winged Cup with Geometric Designs,China,3rd century BCE,"By the Warring States period, Chu, noted for its lacquer production, was the major cultural force in south central China. The visual arts of Chu are often characterized as shamanistic in response to the prevalence of images of fairylike creatures riding on dragons, or clouds that change imperceptibly into dragons, and, as they meander through the sky, transform again into dragons. The playful, thin lines painted on this winged cup are a later stylized version of the traditional cloud-dragon motif. The two large winglike appendages on the cup are often described as ""ears"" in Chinese writings, and cups of this type, known from at least the eighth century B.C., are generally termed ""ear-cups,"" or erbei.

His reign was short-lived, however, as he died in June 1916.This pair of vases (with 68.4.1) have mirror-image designs that have been painted over the glaze in sepia and black pigments with minute attention to detail.

Such adaptations were formalized in 1759 when the style and decoration of court robes were standardized under regulations which also designated colors and designs for different types of robes. The dark blue color and four-clawed dragons on this robe indicate it would have been worn by an individual ranking somewhere between a third degree prince and a fourth degree official.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/17_82_2 front.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/68295
Letters,Various calligraphers,未知年代,"明 T家尺 五册 本Chinese calligraphy is more than just handwriting. From at least the second century, it was considered an outlet for personal expression, not just in the words one wrote, but also in the abstract forms of one’s brushwork. Correspondingly, it was believed that a sensitive viewer could read a man’s character through his calligraphy. Letters were seen as particularly revealing because they were private documents that encouraged the most unguarded type of personal expression. In reality, however, famous calligraphers knew that their letters might be collected as works of art, and they strove to write beautifully even in private correspondence.These letters are by men of the Ming dynasty (1368C1644). They were preserved by collectors because of the fame of the writers, the beauty of the calligraphy, or both. Writing and reading letters were important daily activities in imperial China, where jobs were often located far away from friends and family. Many were written quickly and often for practical purposes, and they offer a glimpse inside the daily life of the scholar’s studio.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/EX.2012.2.022.5_08_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/78859

"The Deity Vajrabhairava, Tantric Form of the Bodhisattva Manjushri",China,early 15th century,"The most popular tantric manifestation of Manjushri is Vajrabhairava. Here, he has a buffalo head, holds an array of weapons, and tramples on birds, dogs, and Hindu gods. In this form, he is sometimes called Yamantaka, or the defeater of death, a deity that ends the cycle of rebirth and provides a path to nirvana. He frightens away egotism and selfishness―the root of suffering―and in this true form reveals the awesome and terrifying nature of enlightenment. For this extraordinary embroidery, the artist employed fine silk floss to achieve brilliant gradations of color and used horsehair underneath to create three-dimensional effects. The work was likely part of a group given by the Yongle-period emperor Chengzu to a Tibetan monk who conducted Vajrayana rituals in the Chinese court in 1415C16.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-15583-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39742

One Hundred Horses,Giuseppe Castiglione (Lang Shining 郎世),datable to 1723C25,"During the eighteenth century, the Manchu Qing dynasty sponsored a major revival of courtly arts, which attained a new monumental scale, technical finish, and descriptive intricacy. A key figure in establishing this new court aesthetic was the Italian Jesuit Giuseppe Castiglione. A master of vividly naturalistic draftsmanship and large-scale compositions, in Europe he worked as a muralist. Castiglione helped to create a new, hybrid style that combined Western realism with traditional Chinese conventions of composition and brushwork.This monumental scroll, a unique example of a Castiglione preparatory drawing, is the model for one of Castiglione's most famous paintings, the One Hundred Horses scroll preserved in the National Palace Museum, Taipei. The drawing, although done with a brush rather than a pen, is executed almost exclusively in the European manner. Landscape is represented using Western-style perspective, figures are often shown in dramatically foreshortened views, and vegetation is depicted with spontaneous arabesques and cross-hatching. The large scale of the painting also suggests a European influence, as if Castiglione had taken a typical Western canvas and extended its length to make an architectural frieze.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP355646.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44632

Sea and Sky at Sunrise,Unidentified artist,17th century,"This fanciful painting bears a suite of false inscriptions and seals, including a fake signature of the twelfth-century court painter Zhao Boju. Zhao was famous for his blue-green landscapes, and many paintings bearing his name were produced in later centuries, some intended to fool collectors and others as charming reproductions. This painting, likely made in the seventeenth century, belongs to the latter category. The intense palette of azurite blue and malachite green, and the scalloped clouds that cling to the mountains, signals a magical, mysterious place that is difficult to access and inhabited by supernatural beings.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP201158_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/51564

Yong Zin Khon Shogpel: Seventh Abbot of Ngor Monastary,Tibet,16th century,"This painting is one of two in The Met collection from a set depicting the abbots of Ngor monastery, which follows the teachings of the Sakya school. Tibetan Buddhism assigns exceptional prestige and reverence to abbots, who were seen as empowered to transmit the pure teachings of the Buddha; on occasions the most revered were accepted as the living embodiments of enlightenment. Founded in 1429, Ngor monastery quickly became a center of excellence for painting, initially produced under the direction of Nepalese master artists. By the sixteenth century, influences from Chinese painting began appearing, as seen here in the treatment of the throne and drapery. In the upper and framing registers is the Sakya order lineage, and in the lower register are protective and auspicious deities.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT5219.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/37816
Monastic Dance Robe,China,early 19th century,"Ritual dances (cham) featuring music have always been an important part of Tibetan Buddhist practice.

A monk dressed as a stag cuts the torma into pieces, scattering them as he dances to rid the community of hostile forces. The large audiences that attended these dances had to see the stag costumes from afar, so they are deliberately exaggerated―the large eyes and antlers of this mask give the dancer greater stature.

"Vase with decoration of rocks, flowers, and butterflies",China,未知年代,"The decorating of porcelain with lacquer and mother-of-pearl exemplifies the inventiveness of Chinese art from the mid-seventeenth to the early eighteenth century. Although the vase is not marked, the shape is common among works produced during the reign of the Kangxi emperor. However, it is not clear if the lacquer and pearl shell were added when the vase was made or slightly later. Vases with this type of decoration are found in some numbers in Europe, where they are often known as laques burgautés,a term that was coined by nineteenth-century French specialists in porcelain and that is frequently, and incorrectly, used to describe works in lacquer with mother-of-pearl decoration.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP138469.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/50822
Belt Plaque in the Shape of a Crouching Horse,North China,3rdC1st century BCE,"Intriguing metal artifacts such as this silver plaque and scattered references in Chinese and Western histories are our only sources of information about the numerous pastoral, seminomadic, and horse-riding tribes that inhabited the vast reaches of Central Asia traversed by the Silk Road.Most likely used as an adornment on a bridle or other equine accoutrement, this small plaque illustrates the dissemination of artistic motifs across Asia. The beaklike shape of the horse's muzzle, the dramatic twist of its hindquarters, and the lively openwork frame all reflect an imagery and stylistic approach found in objects made earlier by Indo-European Scythian peoples living on the Iranian plateau and in the area around the Black Sea. Comparable motifs appear in tattoos on the body from tomb 2 at Pazyryk, in the Altai mountains of southern Siberia. Eight of the twenty-five burial mounds (kurgan) at that site, currently dated between the late fourth and early third century B.C., have yielded textiles and metalwork from West and Central Asia as well as silk, lacquer, and metalwork from China.This plaque was cast in silver and has remnants of gilding on its surface. It was probably made in North China for a member of the Yuezhi or one of the other confederacies in Central Asia that maintained an active trade with various Chinese centers, exchanging furs and carpets for commodities such as grain and luxuries such as silk or metalwork.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT8148.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44787
Pair of Square Seals with Cloud and Rock Pattern,China,20th century,"Seal carving became an important branch of Chinese literati art during the late sixteenth century, when artists began using soft stones, or soapstones, for the craft. A variety of soapstones, particularly those from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces on China's southeastern coast, quickly became the preferred material, chosen for their fine texture, attractive colors, subtle luster, sensuous feel, and jadelike translucence. These stones have since been held in the highest esteem by artists and collectors alike. As the extensive exploitation in the last few centuries has practically exhausted their sources, they are now in extremely limited supply.This pair of seals, each a square prism with a gently curving top, are made of duchengkang stone, which is named after the site of its occurrence in Fujian Province and celebrated for its mellow amber color and fine grain. On their smoothly polished surface, clouds and rocks, common decorative motifs on the sides of seals, are skillfully and fluidly carved in low relief.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP145878.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/73666

Dish with warrior,China,未知年代,"The dramatic warrior with two axes depicted in the center of this plate illustrates the addition of figures based on popular plays and novels to the repertory of kraak ware, a type of ceramic that was often exported to Europe. This warrior, who cannot be precisely identified, holds axe in his lowered right hand, with a second one in his belt, and may be allusion to Li Gui (also known as the Black Whirlwind), one of the heroes of the classic Ming novel The Water Margin (Shui Hu Zhuan). The composite groupings of flowers on the panel, on the other hand, reflect the impact of contemporaneous Turkish Iznik wares on the evolution of kraak ware in the early seventeenth century while some of the single blossoms represent tulips, a flower that was first cultivated in Turkey, and eventually spread to Holland as part of the development of global trade, including Chinese porcelains, in the late sixteenth and seventeenth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-12231-014.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/714952

The Civil Official Door Guards “Five Great Fortunes” and “Longevity”,China,early 20th century,"While images of military figures guard doors that face onto the street, those of civil officials with benign faces and quiet dignity are placed on inner doors. This pair of door guards wears robes decorated with a crane, emblematic of the highest rank in the civil service system. On the tray held by the right-hand official stands a deer (lu), which is homophonic with the Chinese character for “emoluments.” On the tray in the left-hand print is a qilin, a legendary animal that carries a variety of felicitous associations.

Horsemanship Competition for the Shunzhi Emperor,Nardunbu,dated 1662,"This long handscroll documents one of the celebratory events accompanying the entrance of the Shunzhi emperor (r. 1644C61) into Beijing shortly after the fall of the Ming dynasty to the Manchus. Painted by a Manchu artist, it is among the earliest examples of Qing courtly painting known and suggests the unsophisticated nature of Manchu art prior to the sinicization of the court under the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662C1722). The scroll is not only of great historical interest but also serves as a striking foil to The Kangxi Emperor's Southern Inspection Tour (acc. no. 1979.5) of about 1697, which reflects the impact of mainstream Chinese culture on court patronage.The painting which is probably a preparatory sketch, presents a file of horsemen each performing a different riding stunt (below). At the right end two rows of imperial bodyguards flank two horsemen who are about to perform. Five men blow conches to announce the next rider, while two officers, one identified by a peacock feather in his cap, direct. Each rider was originally accompanied by two label strips naming his pose and military unit. All of the horsemen belong to one of the three highest-ranking of the eight ""banners"" that divided the Manchu army.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP104395_crd.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/65013

"Mandala of Vajradhara, Manjushri and Sadakshari -Lokeshvara",Unidentified artist,dated 1479,"The Tibetan branch of Esoteric Buddhism, introduced into China during the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1279C1368), continued to be patronized by early Ming dynasty emperors. Throughout the fifteenth century, a significant community of Tibetan lamas remained active in Beijing, the site of the former Mongol capital city, Dadu, and after 1402 the principal Ming capital.This mandala, or cosmic diagram used in meditation, is painted in rich colors on a coarse cloth ground in the Tibetan manner, but the presence of a Chinese dedication along the lower margin as well as a number of distinctive stylistic features suggest that it was the product of an atelier in China that created images based on Tibetan prototypes. Stylistically, the mandala is related to three others, dated between 1477 and 1479, which are now in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.The iconography of this mandala consists of three main deities, the Buddha Vajradhara (above), together with Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom (lower right), and Shadakshari-Lokeshvara, a manifestation of Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion (lower left), set within a field of thirty-nine subsidiary deities. Each deity is seated on a lotus throne and framed by an ornately figured halo. Vajradhara, who grasps two vajras or thunderbolts, is further distinguished by an encircling array of the twelve auspicious Buddhist symbols.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP218157.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/37983

Tree peonies dominate the floral designs, and some segments are actually miniature garden scenes, with decorative, perforated garden rocks and butterflies.In the term for the textile's structure (""cut and voided velvet""), ""cut"" refers to the fact that, as in most velvets we use today, the pile loops have been cut; ""voided"" refers to areas without pile, where the pile warps were not raised onto velvet rods at all but were instead allowed to remain concealed in the background. In this piece, the pattern appears in cut pile, and the background and details of the pattern, such as the veins of leaves, are voided.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/198321.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/70514

A second grouping has largely comparable inscriptions: the spouted water vessel, or he (no. 5) and one cup, or zhi (no. 11).A partial reconstruction of the set’s arrangement in the tomb may be established from corrosion outlines on the three principal vessels―the two wine containers, or you, and the central tall wine container, or zun―that were etched onto the surface of the altar table. The diagram shows a hypothetical arrangement of the remaining vessels around the major pieces. Even if this is accepted as the original grouping, the disparate inscriptions and vessel styles remain unexplained.

In this dish―whose subject is the popular theme of a woman and children surrounded by luxuries―pink is used for the children's clothing and in one of the borders that frames the charming scene.,https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP240964.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/50034

Court Robe,China,18th century,"This Chinese court robe is approximately the same age as the one used to make the Japanese kesa displayed here, and both are made of brocaded satin. Eight dragons, four seen full-face and four in profile, are visible when the robe is worn. The frontal dragons are on the chest, the upper back, and each shoulder, while the profile dragons decorate the lower part of the robe, one pair confronted on the front and the other on the back. A fifth profile dragon, not seen when the robe is worn, occurs under the front overlap, for a total of nine dragons. In contrast, the kesa features eight dragons, three seen full-face and five in profile; one frontal dragon from a shoulder is missing.Dragon robes of the Qing dynasty featured comparatively narrow sleeves ending in crescent-shaped cuffs. The robes' decoration was standardized: appropriately placed dragons occurred among clouds at the top of the robe and water, waves, and mountains at the hem.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/78670.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/65227

Poem of Farewell to Liu Man,Yelü Chucai,dated 1240,"Yelü Chucai played a pivotal role in mitigating the harsh rule of the Mongols over the occupied territories of North China. A trusted adviser to both Chinggis Khan and his son ?g?dei, he introduced fiscal reforms and an amnesty for tax debts. Unfortunately, many of his administrative reforms were short-lived.The blunt, monumental writing on this handscroll, with its emphatic hooks and dots and square character forms, recalls the unrestrained style of Huang Tingjian (1045C1105), a Northern Song master who advocated ""driving every brushstroke with full force."" The poem lauds the virtuous administration of a young official in an era of widespread exploitation and reflects Yelü's own attempts to institute more humanitarian policies:Half the population of Yun[zhong] and Xuan[de] have fledtheir homes;Only the few thousand people under your care are secure.You are among our dynasty's most able administrators.Your good name is as lofty as Mount Tai.On the sixteenth day of the tenth lunar month in the winter of the gengzi year, Liu Man of Yangmen requested that I write a poem on the eve of his departure. I wrote this for him in admiration of his administrative ability. Abusive officials and wily functionaries should feel ashamed!

The Demon Queller Zhong Kui Giving His Sister Away in Marriage,Yan Geng,未知年代,"Here, the legendary ""demon queller"" Zhong Kui leads his sister to her new home accompanied by an escort of demons performing feats of martial prowess. The comic climax to this spectacle is Zhong Kui himself―stone drunk and propped atop a small donkey by three retainers while his sister sits helplessly astride a recalcitrant water buffalo. The painting illustrates a rebus: ""marrying off one's sister"" (jia mei) is a pun for ""subjugating demons.""Yan Geng may have derived inspiration from actual New Year's processions, during which costumed figures impersonating Zhong Kui and his band of demons circulated through neighborhoods and banished evil in return for payment.

Incense Box (Kōgō) with Camellias,China,13th century,"Small boxes of this type, which are preserved in Japan in some number, are often identified as incense boxes, for they were used as such during the tea ceremony.

"Jar decorated with rock, peonies, and birds",China,mid- to late 17th century,"This colorful jar follows the traditional enameling technique developed during the fifteenth century. Featuring a solid tone, the overglaze enamels are polychromatic but blue appears only in the underglaze, as seen in the outlines around the jar’s neck, shoulder, and base. The dominant use of green, appearing in different hues on rocks, leaves, and the birds’ feathers, is typical of the period. Wares of this type are often identified in the West with the French term famille verte, or “green family.”",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-14608-046.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42394

"Inscriptions on the Stone Drums (Eastern Zhou dynasty, 5th century BCE)",Unidentified artist,17th century,"Written Chinese evolved slowly over more than two millennia before arriving at a modern, ""regular"" script (kai shu) in the third century A.D. The oldest script type, known as ""seal"" script (zhuan shu), developed gradually during the Shang, Zhou, and Qin periods (ca. 1500C206 B.C.) and is characterized by curvilinear picturelike forms executed in strokes of even thickness.Inscriptions on the Ten Stone Drums, which record royal hunting expeditions, were probably engraved by one of the early dukes of the Qin state and constitute the earliest monumental seal-script texts of any length to survive. The script represents a transitional style between the ""large-seal"" script found on Shang and Zhou bronze vessels and the standardized ""small-seal"" script employed in official documents of the Qin dynasty (221C206 B.C.). The drums, discovered near Baoji in Shaanxi Province in the seventh century A.D., were moved to the imperial palace in Kaifeng by Emperor Huizong (r. 1101C25). When Jurchen Jin troops captured the Song capital in 1127, the drums were moved again to Beijing, where they are now in the Palace Museum.The tradition of making ink rubbings of stone- and wood-carved inscriptions was a precursor to printing in China and made possible the wide dissemination of calligraphic models.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP363290.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39890

“Magic Fountain” ewer,China,mid-16th century,"This ewer illustrates the vivid artistic and cultural exchange between China, the Middle East, and Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The pear-shaped ewer with curving spout and handle can be traced back to metal pitchers from the Middle East. Successfully rendering this foreign design with porcelain, from the fourteenth century onward Chinese potters made this type of ewer for both domestic and foreign markets. The heavily potted body, slightly bluish glaze, and rich cobalt blue décor are characteristic features of Jingdezhen porcelain from the mid-sixteenth century, which helps to date this piece. The “magic fountain” motif likely has a European source. In 1952, the late Sir Percival David connected this image to the legendary silver wine fountain designed by a Parisian goldsmith Guillaume Boucher for the Mongol Khan Mongke (r. 1251C1259) while Boucher served at Mongke’s court in Karakorum in present-day Mongolia. Scholars have since suggested that the image was more likely to have been inspired by a sixteenth-century European print, painting, or tapestry and were first commissioned by Jesuit missionaries in China. When such vessels reached Europe, they were highly valued and have even appeared in still life paintings, such as one by Williem Kalf (1619C1693) now in the collection of Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum, Madrid",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-28519-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/857949

Covered box decorated with the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove,China,ca. 1640,"The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove were a group of scholars and writers of the third century who chose spiritual freedom over political engagement during a chaotic era. Although in reality they may not have known one another personally, they are said to have gathered in a bamboo grove near the house of the group’s leader, Ji Kang (ca. 223Cca. 262), to enjoy wine, music, and metaphysical discourse. The surface decoration on these two vessels shows the sages engaged in a variety of scholarly pursuits.

Early spring landscape,Unidentified artist,mid-13th century,"Throughout the mid-thirteenth century, during the reign of Emperor Lizong (r. 1224C64), the Southern Song Painting Academy continued to flourish under the leadership of Ma Yuan, Xia Gui, Li Song, and Ma Yuan's son Ma Lin. In landscape painting, the decorative realism of Liu Songnian (active ca. 1150Cafter 1225) remained popular. Evening in the Spring Hills, a fan painting by an anonymous midthirteenth- century master, recalls Liu's sumptuous landscape style. Seen below two great pine trees with ball-shaped clusters of pine needles and twisting branches executed in a smooth polished brushwork is a bird's-eye view of a private garden in the hills outside Hangzhou. On a fresh spring evening, the branches flowering with perfect pink blossoms, the garden owner and his guest stand in a pavilion that overlooks a broad valley to view the green hills with notched silhouettes in the distance.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-19460-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40091

Inkstone with Bamboo Design,China,late 18th century,"The green inkstone is carved in the shape of bamboo stem segments and is adorned in low relief with leafy branches rising from behind rocks. The slanted surface of the sunken grinding area displays multiple layers of natural markings within the stone in purple and various shades of green. The wooden box is also carved in the shape of a length of bamboo.The ink slab and its case bear three inscriptions, which offer clues and raise questions about the work's date. An inscription on the underside of the stone and one on the lid of the box, although signed Qinggong Daoren and Nancun, respectively, both have the same seal, Zuo. While these names are unknown from other sources, they probably denote the same person. The stone's inscription is dated to 1370, which is curiously early, considering the good condition of the box. The third inscription, on the upper side of the slab, comprising eight delicate characters executed in regular script, is dated to the summer solstice of the renwu year (1702), signed Wang Shizhen (1634C1711), a preeminent poet of the early Qing period, and is followed by Wang's seal, Yuan. If this inscription is not a genuine ownership mark by Wang Shizhen, it is likely to have been added either during Wang's time or not long after his death. From 1722 onward, because the character zhen in Wang's name also occurred in the personal name of the newly enthroned Yongzheng emperor (r. 1723C35), the characters of Wang's name were replaced by others that have a similar sound. Since here Wang's name was written in its original form, the inscription was probably carved before 1722.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT9333.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/41867

Side Panel from a Sarcophagus,North China,12thC13th century,"The headstone of this sarcophagus is embellished with an acting troupe poised to perform on the balcony of a two-story building. The side panels feature narrative scenes illustrating twenty-four stories of filial piety. A very similar set of engraved illustrations was discovered on the sarcophagus of Pan Dechong (1191C1256), who was buried in 1260 on the grounds of the Yongle Palace, a famous Daoist temple located in southwestern Shanxi Province. Pan was a leading member of the Quanzhen sect of northern Daoism, which advocated the importance of filial behavior, so it is not surprising that the Confucian theme of filial paragons was adopted to decorate his sarcophagus. The significance of the theatrical troupe is still unclear.These narrative scenes are a popular manifestation of the subject matter and fine-line drawing style of the scholar-artist Li Gonglin (ca. 1041C1106), particularly his Classic of Filial Piety of around 1085. Li's masterpiece gave contemporary relevance to this canonical Confucian subject through a new expressive style of calligraphic brushwork as well as through the creation of a new set of illustrations that offered subtle commentaries on contemporary political and moral questions. The sarcophagus, which may be dated roughly two hundred years later, shows the widespread impact of Li's thematic concerns and drawing style on popular art forms",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/1994_370a_O1.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40240

Lobed Plaque,,late 19thCearly 20th century,"The silver jeweled ornaments of the Turkoman tribes of Central Asia are characterized by their bold forms, striking profiles, and prominent semiprecious stones, most often carnelians or turquoise. By the nineteenth century, the once seminomadic Turkoman people had settled in various parts of Iran, Afghanistan, and Chinese and former Soviet Central Asia, but metalworkers' guilds continued to hold an honored position in each center. Turkoman silversmiths produced a variety of objects in a style and with motifs that reflected both Islamic and shamanist cultural influences: jewelry for women and children; ornaments and fittings for knives, helmets, and belts; and harnesses and other embellishments for horses and other animals.This pendant of somewhat unusual form originally hung from a chain threaded through metal rings attached to the loops on the rectangular plate at the top. The combination of filigree and a thicker silver rim is often seen in Turkoman silver jewelry. The use of blue stones as protection from the ""evil eye"" has a long history in Islamic culture, particularly in the Persianate world.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/is/mobile-large/DP137534.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/455235

These features may reflect a unique shooting method called yishe, or corded-arrow hunting, which was a leisure activity among elites from the Eastern Zhou (771C256 B.C.) through the Eastern Han. Yishe involved firing an arrow attached to a silk cord with a weighted mechanism tied to its end.

Here, they await the arrival of Shoulao, God of Longevity, who is flying above the waves on the back of a crane.

Guanyin as the Nine-Lotus Bodhisattva,Unidentified artist,1593,"In the summer of 1586, nine lotus flowers in the Ming imperial palace issued double blooms, a rare occurrence that was seen as an auspicious omen. That the flowers bloomed in the residence of the Empress Dowager Cisheng, mother of the emperor, was particularly favorable, for Cisheng was a devout Buddhist who had dreamed of her own incarnation as Guanyin. This painting is one of several Cisheng commissioned to celebrate the occasion. The composition, which places the boy pilgrim Shancai (Sudhana, in Sanskrit) before a maternal bodhisattva in a palace setting, strongly suggests that we are meant to see Cisheng as Guanyin.

Headstone from a Sarcophagus,North China,12thC13th century,"The headstone of this sarcophagus is embellished with an acting troupe poised to perform on the balcony of a two-story building. The side panels feature narrative scenes illustrating twenty-four stories of filial piety. A very similar set of engraved illustrations was discovered on the sarcophagus of Pan Dechong (1191C1256), who was buried in 1260 on the grounds of the Yongle Palace, a famous Daoist temple located in southwestern Shanxi Province. Pan was a leading member of the Quanzhen sect of northern Daoism, which advocated the importance of filial behavior, so it is not surprising that the Confucian theme of filial paragons was adopted to decorate his sarcophagus. The significance of the theatrical troupe is still unclear.These narrative scenes are a popular manifestation of the subject matter and fine-line drawing style of the scholar-artist Li Gonglin (ca. 1041C1106), particularly his Classic of Filial Piety of around 1085. Li's masterpiece gave contemporary relevance to this canonical Confucian subject through a new expressive style of calligraphic brushwork as well as through the creation of a new set of illustrations that offered subtle commentaries on contemporary political and moral questions. The sarcophagus, which may be dated roughly two hundred years later, shows the widespread impact of Li's thematic concerns and drawing style on popular art forms",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/1994_346a.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40241

Lotus and waterbirds,Unidentified artist,ca. 1300,"Imported from India, the lotus―growing from the slime of a pond, its blossoms blooming unsullied―was linked to Buddhist images of purity and rebirth. By the thirteenth century, naturalistic depictions of lotus in different seasons also evoked the ephemeral nature of physical beauty. This large-scale decorative work is by a professional painter of the Piling School, situated near Changzhou, Jiangsu Province. The midsummer scene (on the right) shows lotus flowers in early stages of budding and bloom, while the autumnal scene (on the left) shows its later stages: petals falling, leaves turning brown, and seed pods ripening. The newly sprouted water reeds of midsummer also contrast with the late-blooming water plant and the smartweed that has gone to seed, while the busy activity of a pair of ducks skimming the water for food on the right is juxtaposed with two egrets resting quietly on the left.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-36424-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36437

"Samyutagama Sutra, chapter 25, from the Jinsushan Tripitaka",Unidentified artist,datable to 1060sC1080s,"Sutra writing developed its own distinctive tradition of regular script in which individual characters retained the squat, fleshy proportions and compact strokes of early clerical script. In this scroll, comprising 325 columns of standard script, the emphatic thickening of vertical strokes also reflects the scribe’s knowledge of the Tang calligrapher Yan Zhenqing (709C785).Although the scroll is traditionally dated to the Tang dynasty (618C907), a Song date is confirmed by its provenance. The first line of text identifies the scroll’s place of origin as the Guanghui Monastery, a Chan (Zen) Buddhist temple in Zhejiang Province noted for its fine handwritten sutras and high-quality paper. The temple was renamed Guanghui (“boundless kindness”) in 1008, so the scroll cannot date before that year. Since Yan Zhenqing’s style was especially popular during the early Song, the scroll may be dated stylistically to the eleventh century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/1989_363_2_sec01_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39914

Archaic-style vase with poem composed by the Qianlong Emperor,China,late 18th century,This massive jade vase is handsomely incised with a poem composed by the Qianlong Emperor in 1773.

Tomb Gate,China,未知年代,"These five stone slabs―a lintel, two posts, and two door panels―stood at the entrance to a tomb. Their decoration was achieved through a combination of carving and painting. Since pigments deteriorate once stones are unearthed and exposed to air, these rare examples permit a look at the full chromatic glory of Han stone carvings.The pictorial program brings together several symbolic needs of the deceased. Two gigantic doorknockers and a pair of bulls protect the tomb against evil. Patterns on the lintel and posts, including the sun, the moon, and auspicious animals, signal the heavenly domain. On the right-hand door, an immortal following a string of clouds stands ready to guide the deceased into Heaven.

Dog,China,未知年代,"This recumbent dog is captured at a moment of animation: with wide eyes and upright ears, it opens its mouth as though barking, its teeth bared in confrontation. Its compact, hollow body was molded, while its other parts, such as the ears, teeth, and eyes, were sculpted separately and applied to the body.

Lamp with Sixteen Branches,China,未知年代,"This lamp, one of the most elaborate Han examples of its kind, takes the shape of a tree with sixteen branches. The branches follow two prototypes: one has a crane, and the other, a winged immortal riding a dragon. A gigantic turtle in the lowermost basin carries the trunk on its back. (Both the turtle and the crane were Han symbols of longevity.) Three figures and twenty-five animals populate the mountain-shaped base, whose surface is painted with clouds. The clouds suggest a place high above the human world, thus transforming the lamp into a land of immortality―appropriate imagery for a funerary object such as this.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_29_1a-y_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640947

A figure carrying a sack of crops enters from the left, while a recumbent watchdog guards the storage complex to the right of the gate. Designed in a funerary context to emulate a full-scale structure, this model hints at the architectural capabilities of the Eastern Han.

Pillow,China,未知年代,"This pillow was unearthed from a site of the Jingjue state, which once existed at the northwest frontier of China. The fabric illustrates the highly sophisticated technique of five-color woven silk. Although the weave perpetuates an earlier Western Han tradition, the incorporation of more than two or three colors represents an advancement.

Three Fragments of the Xiping Steles,China,未知年代,"The Xiping Steles are so named for the Han emperor Liu Hong’s second reign, called Xiping, which means bright and peaceful. Undertaken during this time was the nine-year task of editing and codifying the Confucian canon. The finished manuscripts were carved on forty-six stone tablets, which were erected at the imperial university in Luoyang and functioned somewhat like textbooks. The steles were damaged during the wars that followed the fall of the Han. These three fragments are from the Yi Jing (Book of Changes) and Yue Jing (Book of Music), the latter thought to have been lost since the Qin dynasty.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/IA-qh352-1-1.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/732460
Horse and Groom,China,未知年代,"After the Han diplomat Zhang Qian (d. 113 B.C.) brought “heavenly horses” back with him from Dawan, an ancient kingdom in modern Uzbekistan, Emperor Wu (r. 141C87 B.C.) ordered two major military campaigns in order to obtain these grand beasts for his cavalry. This large bronze sculpture illustrates one such celebrated horse, characterized by an arching neck, firm legs, and stocky haunches. Its pointed ears and flared nostrils exude vigor. The knot in its tail suggests that the horse formed part of the cavalry, or possibly a ceremonial procession. The groom is also a member of the military, as indicated by the shield on his left arm.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_13_3ak_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/732461

Together, the five classics embody the fundamental principles and code of conduct endorsed by the government. Found in a tomb in the northwestern frontier, this wood slip, a common form of document before the advent of paper, illustrates how Confucian teachings prevailed from the heartland to the farthest corners of the empire.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/IA-3.GS_DSC9367.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/719113
Inscribed Weight,China,未知年代,"Both the weight and the measure are inscribed with the same edict:In the twenty-sixth year (i.e., 221 B.C.), the Emperor completely unified the regional lords of the All-under-Heaven.

As for the standards, lengths, measures, and rules that are not unified and are doubtful, clarify and unify them all.The inscription demonstrates efforts to unify and standardize systems throughout the Qin Empire, one of the first undertaken by the new regime. Not only did it enable the collection of grain taxes at a uniform rate throughout the conquered territories, but it also communicated to the widest possible audience the legitimacy and authority of the empire.The weight is notable in that it is made of iron, not bronze; only the largest weights in the Qin system were.

Staff with Bird-Shaped Finial,China,未知年代,"This wood walking staff was found together with ten wood slips that record an imperial edict specifying the privileges afforded to seniors. Topped with a finial in the shape of a partridge, the staff enabled its holder to enter a government office at will and to walk on the side of the road that was otherwise reserved for the emperor.

Crossbow (Modern Replica),China,Original: Qin dynasty (221C206 BC),"The crossbow was one variety of long-range, delayed-discharge weapons used in ancient China. The launching mechanism (see ill.), usually cast in bronze, was mounted at the rear of the wood arm. The bow staves were installed crossways at the front. The arrow was nestled lengthwise into the flight groove. While an archer pulls a regular bow using only the strength of his arm, a crossbow calls for the added support of both his foot and back, yielding a more powerful release.

Ten Arrows,China,未知年代,"While bronze arrowheads continued to be used during the Qin dynasty, their shape had evolved considerably from earlier eras.

First half of Ten Thousand Li of the Yangzi River,Unidentified artist,late 15th century,"This handscroll was split into two pieces; this is the first half. Once attributed to the Southern Song court painter Xia Gui, these paintings in fact reflect a later interpretation of the artist’s style. Xia’s subtle brushwork has been magnified in both size and intensity to create a bold, high-contrast work of art. Ten Thousand Li of the Yangzi River exemplifies a type of fifteenth-century painting in which earlier styles―especially those of the Southern Song―were intensified to cater to the aesthetic of court and urban patrons.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP165823_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36011

Saucer with two chi dragons,China,14thC15th century,"This elegant saucer features an unusual design―two sinuous dragons covered with hair rather than scales. Their complex layout amid floral scrolls matches compositions often seen on works from the early Ming period. The saucer also has carving that is distinctively sharp and deep with less polished corners. These elements suggest that the piece is an early example of Yunnan carving, a lacquer school attributed to the Yunnan region of southwest China that developed from the fourteenth to sixteenth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-22634-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/52145
Pair of Finials in the Shape of Mythical Beasts,China,未知年代,"From the fifth to the third century B.C., images of mythical animals began to appear in China that hinted at contact with nomadic peoples from the north and west.

Female Musician Playing a Zither,China,未知年代,"This kneeling musician, together with the two other musicians and two dancers in this gallery, once formed part of a troupe of performers interred with a deceased prince to entertain him in the afterlife. She was excavated together with her instrument, the realistic depiction of which allows for its identification as a se, a type of zither.

Spearhead,China,未知年代,"The spear (mao) was the primary hand weapon for jabbing in ancient China. Its use continued into the Qin era, which also witnessed the emergence of the pi, a broad-bodied spear with flat edges. The Qin army was equipped with both types of spear, though use of the pi was more widespread.

Four chariot warriors,China,未知年代,"These twelve figures were among the roughly 2,400 terracotta warriors excavated from the tomb of Liu Yue, prince of a Han fief state. Made of fine clay, the figures were originally brightly painted, as indicated by surviving traces of pigment. The charioteers assume seated postures, as they would on their vehicles, while the foot soldiers, arms extended, probably once held long-handled dagger-axes or spears. They represent the two major components of the Han army during the early years of the dynasty: the chariot division and the infantry.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_27_2a-d_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640840
Pair of Crossbow Holders (Cheng nu qi ) with Crossbow Ornament,China,未知年代,"Cheng nu qi were used to secure crossbows to chariots, ensuring their ready access by soldiers. They were usually made of bronze and occurred in pairs. The body of the holder assumed a flattened cylindrical shape. The front end extended upward into a hook, while the back end opened into a socket that attached to the front of the chariot car. (Revisit the chariot model in the first gallery to envision a mounted crossbow in use.) The present example is one of six pairs of crossbow holders excavated from the tomb of Prince Liu Sheng of Zhongshan. Its impeccable manufacture reveals the lavish tastes of Han nobles.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/QH.058a_c-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640850
Civil Official,China,未知年代,"This civil official or scribe was one of twelve figures found in a pit southwest of the First Emperor’s tomb. The pit and its contents may have represented the office of the Commandant of the Court, the highest legal bureau in the empire. The figure’s peaked cap probably represents the type worn by officials of his merit rank. His long robe is belted; many such figures wear a knife and a bag suspended from their belt, the bag presumably containing a sharpening stone. The knife was used to excise errors written on bamboo or wood documents.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_23_1ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640793
Four horses,China,未知年代,"Each of these horses is carved from a single piece of wood. They are lacquered in black with highlights in bright red. The riders, each one also carved from a single woodblock, are not lacquered but painted, with pigment over white slip, now mostly lost after millennia of burial. They probably functioned as honor guards in a ceremonial procession, a typical element of Han tomb furnishings. It is notable that they were found at Mianyang, Sichuan Province, where the lacquer industry flourished during the Han dynasty.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/052-QH051.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640843
Head of Warrior,China,未知年代,"This detailed visage of a young warrior is among the most striking to be recovered from the tomb of Emperor Jing (r. 157C141 B.C.). His well-modeled physical features perpetuate the “realism” of Qin sculpture―represented most notably by the terracotta warriors of the First Emperor of Qin. Although this tendency toward naturalism survived into the early phases of Han figural art, it was only a brief episode, soon to be replaced by a highly stylized portrayal of the human form.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_26_2ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640847

Tripod Food Container (Ding) with Cloud Pattern,China,2nd century BC,"Used as a ritual container for food, the ding tripod was one of the most important status symbols in ancient China. The present example reflects the Han trend of using lacquer instead of bronze for making such vessels. It further exemplifies the high-quality lacquerware produced in official workshops in Sichuan during the early Western Han. It bears a mark reading “made in the city of Chengdu,” the capital of Sichuan.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/QH102.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640894
Kneeling Archer,China,未知年代,"Excavations of the mausoleum of the First Emperor of Qin revealed terracotta models of 108 cavalry, 332 archers and infantry, and a combined unit of more than 300 charioteers, cavalry, and infantry, all fully armored. Based on this figure’s gestures, we can assume that he was an archer, whose original weapon―a crossbow― is now lost. He is the only figure on view here that still bears traces of color, indicating that he was once vividly painted (see the red of his armor laces and the black of his collar). Chemical analysis suggests the use of mineral pigments such as cinnabar, azurite, malachite, bone or lead white, and an artificially produced mineral pigment commonly known as “Han purple.”",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_23_4_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640798

Armored Infantryman,China,未知年代,"The main battalion of the First Emperor’s terracotta army comprised infantrymen like this one, aligned in rows of four. He wears body and shoulder armor over a long tunic. Judging from his gesture, he once held a weapon, possibly a halberd or spear.The terracotta warriors were all products of mass production. Parts such as the head, arms, and torso were molded separately as modules and then assembled. Before firing, however, clay was applied to their surfaces to allow for individualization and refinement. Most figures were fired as a single piece, suggesting the use of large-chambered kilns.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2071_23_3a-d_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640796
Chariot Model (Modern Replica),China,未知年代,"The chariots on which these two half-life-size models are based were excavated in 1980 from the mausoleum complex of the First Emperor of Qin. Both models bear details faithful to full-size examples. Model no. 1, shielded by an umbrella-like canopy, is a light chariot, used in battle or for inspection tours. Model no. 2 has a heavier carriage, and its box, enclosed under an oval-shaped canopy, is large enough for passengers to sit or sleep.After his conquest was complete, the First Emperor toured the unified country in his chariot―the same vehicle that would later carry his body to Xianyang for burial. These replicas may have been intended to evoke that chariot. As such, they worked in concert with the terracotta warriors, stone armors, bronze weapons, and interred body of the emperor to complete a narrative of eternal power.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/009-QH012.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640804
Lamp in the Shape of a Deer,China,未知年代,"One of a pair, this lamp was excavated from the area of a princely tomb that housed bathroom utensils. Judging by its long neck and mane, this deer probably represents the mi species, or Père David’s deer, which populated northern China in antiquity but has since gone extinct. The tray would have been filled with an animal- or plant-based fuel, and a hemp stem was plugged onto each of the three spikes, to be lit as a wick. Two lumps of beeswax were found together with this lamp, providing evidence of its use as lighting fuel in the Han dynasty.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_15_1ae_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640902
Serving tray,China,2nd century BC,"Made from tree sap, lacquer was one of the earliest inventions of East Asia. Its use in southeast China can be traced to the Neolithic period. Although raw lacquer is toxic, it is harmless when dry, and its remarkable resistance to water, acid, and heat makes it ideal for culinary utensils.This group represents a set of tablewares for individual use, reflecting dining etiquette of the Han period. Each person had his or her own low table on which a tray of vessels for food and drink was placed. Guests did not sit around one large table, as they do today.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_3_2_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640897
Head of a Broad Spear (Pi),China,未知年代,"The spear (mao) was the primary hand weapon for jabbing in ancient China. Its use continued into the Qin era, which also witnessed the emergence of the pi, a broad-bodied spear with flat edges. The Qin army was equipped with both types of spear, though use of the pi was more widespread. Pit no. 1 of the First Emperor’s mausoleum yielded five mao versus sixteen pi, a ratio of one to three, indicating that the pi had relegated the mao to a secondary position on the battlefield.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_23_11ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640809

Horse,China,未知年代,"The Qin were known for their expertise in raising horses, a knowledge likely gleaned from their nomadic neighbors. By the late Eastern Zhou period (771C256 B.C.), they employed large numbers of horses to pull chariots, creating a formidable force on the battlefield.The present example was one of thirty-two horses found in a single pit. They were accompanied by eight chariots and twenty-four charioteers, meaning that there were four horses and three soldiers for each chariot. This horse is heftily built with alert eyes, pointed ears, a well-trimmed mane, and a knotted tail―all characteristics of Qin war horses.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_23_6ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640802
Female Musician Playing a Flute or Panpipe (Sheng?),China,未知年代,"This kneeling musician, together with the two other musicians and two dancers in this gallery, once formed part of a troupe of performers interred with a deceased prince to entertain him in the afterlife. That she raises both arms to her mouth suggests that she may have played a wind instrument. Her hands were missing at the time of excavation, but a panpipe and a type of reedpipe identified as a sheng were discovered alongside her, suggesting her role.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_27_8ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640882
Wine Container (Zhong) with Interlacing Dragons,China,未知年代,"This extraordinary vessel was unearthed from the tomb of Prince Liu Sheng. One of the most important archaeological discoveries of the Han period, the tomb yielded numerous luxury objects that illuminate the magnificence of Han craftsmanship. The pattern of stylized dragons and phoenixes shares similarities with earlier Qin motifs. An inscription on its underside indicates that it was used at the kitchen of the Prince of Chu, who attended the Rebellion of the Seven States in 154 B.C. It was probably a trophy presented to Liu Sheng after his father, the Emperor Jing (r. 157C141 B.C.), quashed the rebellion.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_20_3ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640888

Mold for “Half-Ounce” Coins (Banliang),China,未知年代,"The Qin economy was monetarized in the mid-fourth century, and over time many different types of bronze coin were in circulation. This mold may date from 210 B.C., when the First Emperor ordered the issue of greater numbers of “half-ounce” coins. The Qin also used standard-sized bolts of cloth as a medium of exchange, with one length of cloth equaling eleven coins. The Han generally followed Qin monetary policy and, under Emperor Wu (r. 141C87 B.C.), issued a new type of bronze coin, the wuzhu, consolidating production in 114 B.C.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_24_3_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640817
Model Armor,China,未知年代,"Excavations of the First Emperor’s tomb yielded numerous stone models of armors and helmets, all of which appear to be copies of actual metal armors, and presumably the more advanced, iron gear of the Qin era. The present example is structurally complete, with body armor, shoulder plates, and a fringe at the waist and hips. The rows of scales comprising the body armor are fixed, while those of the shoulder plates and fringe allow for movement.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_24_2_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640811
Female Musician Playing Chimes,China,未知年代,"Music and dance played a crucial part in court rituals, facilitating harmony between the cosmos and humankind. This kneeling musician, together with the two other musicians and two dancers in this gallery, once formed part of a troupe of performers interred with a deceased prince to entertain him in the afterlife.

Model Helmet,China,未知年代,"This model helmet replicates the iron headgear that began to supplant bronze examples in the late Warring States period (475C221 B.C.). All of the First Emperor’s terracotta warriors wear suits of armor, but none wears a helmet. The reason for this may be the nature of the terracotta army’s function: to simulate a funerary procession for their ruler.

Rhinoceros and Groom,China,2nd century BC,"Excessive hunting led to the near extinction of the rhinoceros in Han-dynasty China, occasioning their importation from southeast Asia. The anatomical accuracy of the present example indicates that the artist must have modeled his work after a living animal. This rhinoceros, accompanied by a stout, broad-faced groom, formed part of a sculpted menagerie of rare and exotic animals excavated from the tomb of Prince Liu Fei, reflecting not only the prince’s luxurious lifestyle but also the reach of the empire’s influence far beyond its borders.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_15_3ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640907
Jar with Two Handles,China,3rd century BCE,"Two-handled jars are known from western Sichuan to the far southern province of Yunnan, excavated primarily from slate tombs located along rivers. They are believed to have been made by the Qiang, a tribal people likely from the northern steppes who traveled south to the Dian region, in present-day Yunnan Province. The present example is inlaid with bronze on its upper body and handles, indicating its exceptional status (plain examples are far more common). The twin handles reflect nomadic forms, while the metal inlays indicate the influence of sedentary agricultural societies to the southwest.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_9_1_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640956
Wine Container (Fang) with Geometric Patterns,China,未知年代,"This magnificent vessel, meticulously inlayed with stylized clouds and geometric patterns, boasts a robust form and two animal-mask ring handles. It functioned as a wine container.

Sword with Ornamental Fittings,China,未知年代,"Iron swords with jade fittings were prevalent during the Western Han dynasty. The use of jade fittings began in the Eastern Zhou (771C256 B.C.), when they appeared on the pommel and guard of bronze swords. By the Western Han, iron had replaced bronze, and jade adorned not only the pommel and guard but also the tip and slide of the scabbard. These four fittings formed a standard combination, and a sword adorned with the full set became known as a yuju jian, or “jade-fitted sword.” They were not intended for battle but, rather, to be worn by royals and elites.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_20_5ad_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696258
Elephant and Groom,China,2nd century BC,"Discovered in a princely tomb together with the rhinoceros figure displayed nearby, this elephant attests to the deceased’s fascination with rare animals. Elephants were once native to central China, but by the time of the Han, climate change and excessive hunting had led to their retreat to the far south and southwest of the empire. The present example is a highly realistic representation, not least in its heavily folded hide. The role of the accompanying figure is unclear, but the awkward proportions of his head and torso suggest that he was probably an animal trainer or a dwarf actor.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_15_4ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640908
Two Pigs,China,未知年代,"Known as “hand warmers,” hardstone pigs were common Han tomb furnishings, placed in the hands of the deceased.

Bear,China,未知年代,"Bears are native to China, their presence there known since antiquity. They were kept in Han imperial zoos and parks, where the emperor and his entourage enjoyed watching them in performance or in combat with other animals. Bears appear in Han art in media ranging from metalwork and lacquer to pottery and, as here, jade. Among the earliest examples, dating from the early Western Han, is a hollow brick excavated from the palace of the king of Nanyue. It resembles images of bears on horse ornaments of the nomads, suggesting a possible influence from the Eurasian steppes.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_27_9_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640910
Ornament with Two Dancers,China,未知年代,"This ornament depicts two figures dancing atop a sinuous snake.

Ten Disk-Shaped Ingots,China,未知年代,"The use of gold as money in China can be traced back to the Warring States period (475C221 B.C.). Following the standardization of coinage after the Qin unification, round bronze coins entered regular circulation, and gold became an upscale currency. One of its major uses was as annual tribute from princes and marquises to the central government. These ten gold ingots were among 219 pieces discovered about 4 kilometers east of the site of the Han capital, Chang’an.

Pendant,China,未知年代,"The peculiar shape of this ornament has led some to associate it with a turtle.

Water Clock,China,未知年代,"This water clock originally had a gauge incised with lines marking divisions of time. Probably made of wood or bamboo, the gauge was inserted into the hole in the cover and floated on the water. As the water drained at a constant rate through the tube at the bottom, the gauge sank steadily, allowing the time to be read at each mark. Water clocks were kept in every office throughout the empire. Beginning in Qin times, officials were required to note the date and time of all incoming and outgoing correspondence and to record this information on the documents themselves.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_24_11_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696219
Standard Measure (Dou),China,未知年代,"Wang Mang (ca. 45 B.C.C A.D. 23), a usurper of the Han throne, established the short-lived Xin dynasty in A.D. 9. The present vessel is one of the few surviving examples illustrating his standardization of measurements. Most striking are the reliefs of five auspicious crops on its sides, identified by inscriptions. The patterns are too fine to have been cast or engraved and are thought to have been painted with lacquer or made by way of chemical treatment.

Burial Ensemble of Dou Wan,China,未知年代,"This burial ensemble was excavated from the tomb of Dou Wan, wife of Prince Liu Sheng of Zhongshan. The suit consists of small jade plaques, each meticulously shaped and fitted together with gold wire to delineate the curves of the body. It represents the completion of a magical transformation of a deceased individual’s body, accomplished through a layering of jades. The first layer would have been the set of jade plugs seen here, which were inserted into the nine bodily orifices to seal the corpse. Next came a layer of small and large bi disks. The corpse was then encased in this suit, its head resting on the accompanying pillow. The ensemble of jades protected the body and the soul in their entirety, enabling the deceased to attain immortality.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_19_1ar_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696308

Pair of Standing Bovines,China,未知年代,"Slightly taller than the cow, the bull stands out for its muscled shoulders and sturdier, more compact body. Both are realistic in depiction, with such naturalistic features as bulging eyes and wrinkled noses. Their horns are exaggerated crescents, and tiny triangular incisions across the surface of their bodies evoke the texture of cowhide. Their ears may have been cast separately and later joined to the bodies.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_16_1ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640936
Bowl,China,未知年代,"Previously thought to be a Roman import, this bowl’s origins have now been definitively traced to southern China.

Die for a Wine Game,China,未知年代,"This jewel-like die has eighteen faces, two of which are inlaid in silver on gold with the characters jiao (“good go”) and jiulai (“drink wine”). The other sixteen faces are inlaid with the numbers one to sixteen. The die was thrown to decide how many cups of wine a player should drink―quite similar, in fact, to a modern drinking game.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_20_8_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696577
Head Ornament,China,3rd century BC,"This ornament, found around the head of the deceased, comprises hundreds of turquoise, carnelian, and gold beads. Their shapes vary, from flat to faceted to cylindrical. The ornament was found in Zhangjiachuan, where nomadic tribes from the steppes coexisted alongside the Qin. In shape and technique, these beads reveal the influence of the Qin’s nomadic neighbors.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_11_1_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/695562
Cowry Container with Bull and Rider,China,未知年代,"This object was found at Shizhaishan, an ancient site associated with the Dian people, who are cited in the chapter on “southwestern barbarians” in the ancient Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian). Cowry containers may have been converted from bronze drums; the addition of sculpted figures transformed their top surfaces into decorative covers. They began to appear at the peak of the Bronze Age, when cowry shells entered circulation as currency. But as contact increased between the Dian and the Western Han, bronze coins supplanted cowry shells, and containers such as this one may have fallen out of use.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_10_1ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640963

Wine Retriever,China,2nd century BC,"This extraordinary vessel was unearthed from the kitchen quarter of a princely tomb. It is the most lavishly decorated example of its kind ever discovered. A bird, which has a hole in its back, sits on a tube connected to a hollow container, which has a hole in its bottom, implying that this object functioned as a siphon. Experiments reveal that liquid (wine) could be drawn upward from the container and would not drain away if the hole on the bird’s back was covered with a thumb. Thus, the retriever worked more efficiently than a scooper or a ladle to convey wine into a cup.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_15_7_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696555
Bell with Design of a Human Face,China,未知年代,"Commonly known as “bell with goat horns,” bronze bells of this type have been found in southern and southwestern China and also in northern Vietnam. They are believed to be associated with an ethnic group, referred to in historical sources as the Yue, who were active in the region during the Han era. The bells were found together with bronze drums, another instrument closely associated with the Yue, and at times with long-handled bells, flutes, and even a gong, suggesting that they were played as an ensemble. For unknown reasons, these bells disappeared by the end of the Western Han.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_17_4_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640932
Pair of Mittens,China,2nd century BC,"This pair of mittens was one of numerous luxury items found in the compartment of Lady Dai’s coffin that symbolized her living space. Each mitten comprises three types of fabric: plain tabby for the main body, lozenge-patterned gauze as the central ornament, and hand-braided ribbon as the border decoration. Braided into the ribbon at equal intervals are two characters in seal script―qian jin (literally, “thousand gold”), an expression of wealth. An extremely labor-intensive product, this type of refined braidwork was seldom seen after the Han dynasty.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_3_6ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640922

Model of a Two-Story House,China,未知年代,"This model of a stilt house comprises an L-shaped main building, which may have been the residential space, and a rectangular courtyard for keeping livestock (five pottery swine populate the present example). Illustrating many characteristics of the present-day architecture and way of life in southern China, this type of elevated house may have emerged in response to the hot, humid climate of the south. While the practical two-story stilt-style house is local to the region, the courtyard layout may have been adopted from the China Central Plain.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_17_1a-g_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/640928

Short Sword,China,未知年代,"Short swords were used in hand-to-hand combat. As the present example attests, the workmanship of these weapons during the Western Han dynasty was impeccable. Both sides of the blade are inlaid with gold, with one side depicting flames and the other, clouds. Its exquisite decoration designates it as a luxury item for nobles.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/IA-QH21696HB183.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696259
Coffin Handle,China,未知年代,"This ornamental coffin handle was one of a pair found close to Prince Liu Sheng’s corpse. Its decoration is exceptional.

Textile Fragment with Floral Pattern,China,2nd century BC,"This colorful fragment demonstrates a patterning method particular to Western Han textiles. The meandering designs were achieved in two steps: scrolls were first printed in black (likely using a stencil), and then flowers, buds, leaves, and dots were hand-colored in red, gray, and white. Judging from the size of the pattern unit, each complete fabric required thousands of impressions, and all this before the secondary application of color by hand. The intensity of labor and sophistication of design indicate that these textiles, like all the masterworks of embroidery from this tomb, were produced by official workshops.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_3_10_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696722
Tripod Wine Container (Zun),China,未知年代,"This elegant tripod wine vessel features fluidly engraved clouds and mythical animals arranged in two registers around the body. The gilded and silvered patterns create a gleaming surface. A vessel of this form was called zun or, more specifically, wenjiuzun, a term that indicates its use to store a clear liquor that could be repeatedly heated. Zun tripods were a popular style of wine container in the Han period, and contemporary visual materials such as the pictorial brick on display nearby demonstrate that they were used in concert with a ladle.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_25_7ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696596
Female Courtier,China,未知年代,"This is one of three figures―a male warrior, a eunuch, and a female courtier―which were recovered at the tomb of Emperor Jing (r. 157C141 B.C.). They were meant to provide for the emperor in his afterlife, the warrior offering protection, the eunuch and the courtier attending to his needs. The figures were mass produced, with their heads, torsos, and legs molded separately as pieces and then joined with clay before firing.

Textile Fragment with Floral Pattern,China,2nd century BC,"Compared with the large-cloud pattern of the “longevity embroidery” on view nearby, each design unit of this delicate work of embroidery is smaller, and the spaces between stitches is finer. The red buds and curling scrolls relate this pattern to cornelian cherry (zhuyu), a red-fruiting plant used widely in ancient China for medicinal and ceremonial purposes. A fruit-laden branch of the zhuyu worn in the hair on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month (chongyang festival) was believed to ward off evil.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_3_9_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696730
Hollow Brick with Dragon,China,未知年代,"Excavations at Xianyang, the Qin capital, have revealed an architectural complex made up of several royal palaces. They were built on raised platforms and connected by corridors. Their floors were paved with solid tiles decorated with molded patterns, including this one with lozenge- and S-shaped ornaments.The two large hollow bricks at the center of the gallery were used as steps into the palace hall. They bear lively patterns of mythical animals. The dragon probably symbolizes the east, and the tortoise entwined with a snake, known as Xuanwu, the north.

Double-Layered Box,China,2nd century BC,"This luxurious box formed part of the deceased’s personal effects, unearthed together with a large group of musical instruments and wood figurines of performers and waiters. A bronze mirror found in its lower layer indicates that it was a cosmetics box. The red and green clouds painted on its black-lacquered surface are outlined meticulously in white. Exceptionally, these patterns were applied using mineral pigments mixed with oil; among more than five hundred pieces of lacquer excavated at Mawangdui, only a few objects were painted in this way.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_3_8ab_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696590
Lamp with Nine Branches,China,未知年代,"Multibranch lamps were popular in ancient China. The present example has a surmounting oil tray in the shape of a waterbird, possibly a duck. Its nine branches are arranged in three tiers, each carrying a small heart-shaped tray with a spike at the center to hold a wick. The lamp was discovered in a large, lavishly furnished tomb, possibly that of a government official, in the far southwest of the empire.

Drainage Tube,China,未知年代,"QinCHan cities and palaces had sophisticated drainage systems. Large pottery tubes accommodated the water supply and sewage: cylindrical ones for clean water and pentagonal ones for wastewater. The pentagonal shape lent stability when the tubes were stacked. Drainage tubes of this type have been found at Qin sites including the royal palace in Xianyang and structures within the mausoleum of the First Emperor. They continued to be used during the Han dynasty, as exemplified by the present example, found in the mausoleum of Emperor Jing (r. 157C141 B.C.).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_26_8_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/700602

Four Mat Weights in the Shape of Fighting Animals,China,2nd century BC,"Before the chair was introduced to China in the third century A.D., people sat on the floor or on daybeds, over which straw mats were placed for comfort.

Roof-Tile End,China,未知年代,"Tile ends inscribed with characters, in particular auspicious phrases such as chang sheng wu ji, or “long life without end,” became popular during the Han dynasty. Such phrases could occur in combination with the name of the office or palace on which the tiles appeared.

Goose,China,未知年代,"This goose is one of forty-six life-size bronze waterfowl discovered in a single pit at the mausoleum of the First Emperor. The pit also yielded fifteen terracotta figures, likely representing musicians, who together with the birds recreated a scene of leisure and entertainment in the imperial garden.

Textile Fragment with Geometric Patterns,China,2nd century BC,"This textile fragment demonstrates a complicated weaving technique known for only a brief period during the Western Han: the tightly arranged geometric patterns have a raised appearance, achieving a velvet-like effect via the use of highly twisted warps. In addition to several pieces from Mawangdui, a few examples of the technique have been discovered from tombs in Mongolia and in northwest Gansu Province. Because it resembles embroidery, this type of fabric is often related to “woven embroidery” (zhijinxiu), a legendary weaving technique that, according to historical texts, had already been lost by A.D. 54.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_3_11_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/696723
Ten “Half-Ounce” Coins (Banliang),China,未知年代,"The Qin economy was monetarized in the mid-fourth century, and over time many different types of bronze coin were in circulation. This mold may date from 210 B.C., when the First Emperor ordered the issue of greater numbers of “half-ounce” coins. The Qin also used standard-sized bolts of cloth as a medium of exchange, with one length of cloth equaling eleven coins. The Han generally followed Qin monetary policy and, under Emperor Wu (r. 141C87 B.C.), issued a new type of bronze coin, the wuzhu, consolidating production in 114 B.C.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/IA-341-1.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/717364
Textile Fragment with Lozenges,China,2nd century BC,"In contrast to the multicolored embroideries found in the same tomb, this light fabric features subtler motifs in a more somber, coffee-colored palette. The motif―a large lozenge with two smaller lozenges on its shorter ends―is thought to be a stylized rendering of an erbei, or winged cup, the most popular shape of drinking cup of the period (see a lacquer example of one such cup in the adjacent gallery).

Incense Burner (Boshan Lu),China,未知年代,"This censer is of a type called boshan lu, or those in the shape of the universal mountain. The openwork lid features the cardinal emblems of early Han art: the Blue Dragon in the east, the Red Bird in the south, the White Tiger in the west, and the Dark Warrior in the north, the last of which is generally represented by a turtle entwined with a snake but here is embodied by a camel. The camel reflects Han contact with its nomadic neighbors.

Cowry Container with Scene of Sacrifice,China,未知年代,"Thirty-five sculpted figures create a dense composition on this container’s cover. Escorted by two mounted horsemen and flanked by servants, a gilded female sits on a palanquin. The gilding may indicate a higher status. One kneeling female, possibly a servant, holds a parasol, while another female and two males wield a shovel and sowing tools; the group may signal an agricultural ritual. The remaining figures, scattered around the rim, comprise what appears to be a market scene.

Incense burner,China,未知年代,"The openwork on the vessel’s lid allowed fragrant smoke to waft out when incense was burning inside. Whereas in later dynasties charcoal was used to heat incense wood, the practice of the Han period and earlier was to burn fragrant plants, as discovered through specimens found in archaeological excavations. The elite owners of incense burners such as this one would have demanded elaborate craftsmanship and expensive material to demonstrate their wealth and taste.

Seal of Office Responsible for Crops,China,未知年代,"This seal was found at Niya, in far northwestern China. Now in ruins, Niya was once an oasis in the bleak desert, bustling with merchants’ caravans and diplomatic envoys traveling between China and Central and West Asia. It was likely the place for an outpost of the Han government, as well. Although the exact name of the “office responsible for crops” is not recorded, such an office could have been part of a Han military and farming garrison at Niya.

Two Horses,China,未知年代,"These horses, draft animals for a military vehicle, were assembled from modular parts made separately in molds, among them the ears, head and neck, trunk, legs, and tail. A hole at the back of the mouth allowed for the installation of the rein. Faint traces of pigment on the lips, ears, and nostrils suggest that they were once painted.

Ornamental Plaque Showing a Bullfight,China,未知年代,"This ornamental plaque comprises eleven figures and a bull, illustrating a bullfight preceding a ritual sacrifice.

Three Hoof-Shaped Ingots,China,未知年代,"In 2011 local governments intercepted the looting of an ancient tomb west of Nanchang.

Among the hundreds of gold ingots recovered from his tomb were nearly fifty in the shape of hooves. They are of particular significance, for in 95 B.C. Emperor Wu (r. 141C87 B.C.) ordered that the name of gold coinage be changed to linzhi (qilin-hoof) and mati (horse-hoof) to match auspicious omens he had seen in a vision: a white qilin unicorn and a “heavenly” horse.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/LC-SL_1_2017_14_1ac_001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/729901

Model Calligraphies from the “Hall of Three Rarities” (Sanxitang) and the "Collected Treasures of the Stony Moat” (Shiqu Baoji),Various artists,second half of 18th century,"The Hall of Three Rarities, an anthology of rubbings, is one of the monuments of cultural patronage sponsored by the Qianlong Emperor. Based on calligraphic masterworks in the imperial collection, this encyclopedic compilation, which establishes a canon of orthodox writing styles in standard, running, and cursive scripts, is a remarkable demonstration of eighteenth-century connoisseurship and craftsmanship.In eighteenth-century China, the best technique for reproducing a work of calligraphy was to painstakingly make an ink rubbing from a stone engraving. After a tracing copy of the original was made, it was transferred onto a finely polished stone. Next, the traced design was engraved into the stone so that the characters were reversed. Paper was then laid over the stone, dampened, and pressed carefully into the engraved lines. Finally, ink was patted over the surface of the paper so that the recessed characters appeared white against a black ground. This anthology is notable for its precise carving style and the glossy black finish of the rubbings. The stones from which these rubbings were made are preserved in a special hall within the former imperial gardens of Beihai Park, Beijing.Shown here is the final calligraphy in the anthology, a transcription of Eulogy for Ni Kuan (active late 2nd century B.C.) by Dong Qichang (1555C1636), a calligrapher greatly admired by the Qianlong Emperor. Dong's postscript to this text, written in large, cursive-script characters, states that his transcription follows an earlier rendering of this text by the Tang-dynasty court calligrapher Chu Suiliang (596C658).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT7955.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36142

Vase from a Set of Five-Piece Altar Set (Wugong),China,18th century,"Cloisonné is the technique of creating designs on metal vessels with colored glass paste placed within enclosures made of copper or bronze wires, which have been bent or hammered into the desired patterns.

The glass paste, or enamel―which gets its color from metallic oxides―is painted into the contained areas of the design. The vessel is usually fired at a relatively low temperature, about 800 degrees Celsius. Enamels tend to shrink during firing, and the process is repeated several times to fill in the design. Once this process is completed, the surface of the vessel is rubbed until the edges of the cloisons are visible.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP242364.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40726
Canonization scroll of Li Zhong,Unidentified artist,colophon dated 1641,"This painting, an unsigned work of a provincial atelier, is a rare example of popular religious art. Modeled on imperial commendation scrolls, with their ornamental borders of dragons chasing flaming pearls, the scroll illustrates the investiture of a local god into the Daoist pantheon. The first half of the scroll depicts the court of the Jade Emperor, supreme deity of popular Daoism. The enthroned emperor is flanked by four female attendants, four high officials, and two constellations of star deities, as well as guardians of the east and west, who are accompanied by their directional emblems, the dragon and tiger. Approaching this assembly is a file of haloed deities who have entered the sacred precincts through a pair of heavenly gates. The second half of the scroll depicts the entourage of the local god, including standardbearers with emblems of his status, a white charger, a palanquin with eight porters, guardians of the four directions, four attendants carrying incense burners, and figures bearing his sword and seals. This procession ends with a depiction of the local god, shown larger than life to emphasize his importance.

Inkstone and cover with mandarin ducks in a lotus pond,China,11thC12th century,"The simple, functional form of this work is typical of Song literati inkstones. Its cover is finely carved with a pair of mandarin ducks swimming in a lotus pond. The low-relief birds and lotus are further animated by lightly engraved ripples and windswept clouds. Similar patterns found on contemporary ceramics as well as on metalwork in gold or silver attest to the extensive exchange of motifs across different media at this time.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-24061-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/843761

Inkstone with dragon and carp,China,14th century,"This unusual inkstone is carved from a type of stoneware known as chengni, or “filtered clay.” Made from very fine silted clay that has undergone a labor-intensive process of filtering, kneading, molding, firing, and carving, chengni inkstones became popular during the Song dynasty (960C1279). The vigorous carving style of this piece, however, dates it to the fourteenth century. The inkstone’s decoration invokes the myth that a carp, should it succeed in swimming upstream through the Dragon Gate of the Yellow River, will become a dragon. A metaphor for success on the civil service exam, here, the gulf between carp and dragon is defined by the inkstone and inkwell―whose diligent use might well decide the difference between failure and success.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-24062-002.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/843762

Lamp,China,second half 6th century,"While lions are not native to China, there is evidence that some specimens had reached China from the West by the Western Han (206 B.C.CA.D. 9) period.

The cart pulled by a white goat, however, refers to another young man, Wei Jie (286C312), who was also known for his good looks but was not associated with fruit.

Women in a Palace,China,late 17th century,"In China, images of a romanticized world, where elegant women spend their time dancing and playing music, often have historical overtones. Many such scenes are thought to allude to the richness of court life during the Han dynasty (206 B.C.CA.D. 220), an endless source for the antiquarian interests of the seventeenth century. Some also illustrate the tragic story of the beautiful Wang Zhaojun, who was sent by Emperor Yuan (reigned 75C33 B.C.) to marry a Xiongnu chieftain in an attempt to pacify these powerful barbarians. Although this screen does not show the standard scene of a painter rendering her image, it is interesting to note that a single horse is depicted standing beneath a willow tree in the center. This animal may represent Wang’s imminent departure from her safe, and luxurious, life at the court to the less sheltered world of the grasslands in the distant north.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP141220.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/57821

Bird peddler,Unidentified artist,late 15thCearly 16th century,"A jaunty bird peddler is surrounded by six young boys who admire their recent acquisitions or greedily eye other temptations. In addition to various species of birds, his portable display also features a rich assortment of intricate cages, gilt perches, ceramic dishes, lacquer jars, and other paraphernalia required to care for the birds, crickets, and two white rabbits offered for sale.The subject of peddlers first became popular during the Southern Song dynasty (1127C79), when paintings typically showed a rustic knickknack merchant offering his wares to a group of country urchins. During the conscious revival of Song academic styles sponsored by the Ming court, this subject was transformed from a genre image of daily life to an elegant fantasy set within the grounds of an aristocratic household. Here, an elegantly dressed servant, acting the role of peddler, offers a specialized selection of expensive wares to the pampered male children of the family. Such idealized images functioned not merely as entertaining decoration but also as auspicious emblems of a well-governed empire enjoying the rewards of peace and prosperity.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT271148.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39810

Retreats in the Spring Hills,Unidentified artist,first half of the 12th century,"Retreats in the Spring Hills is datable stylistically to the early twelfth century, when artists began to experiment with archaic styles, including the ""blue-and-green"" landscape manner first made popular in the seventh century. In the twelfth-century revival, the flat blue-and-green color scheme was used to evoke feelings of an antique Golden Age.

Shakyamuni coming down from the mountains,Unidentified artist,late 13thCearly 14th century,"This painting stands midway between the hieratic icons employed in formal temple ceremonies and the informal images that served Chan (or Zen) monks as personal devotional images for use in meditation. The intimate scale, informality of the figures' poses, and landscape setting link the painting to Chan-style depictions of Shakyamuni―the human origin of the Buddha―as an ascetic descending from the mountains just prior to achieving Buddhahood. In this scene, the Buddhist equivalent of Christ's Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, Shakyamuni offers a parallel to the Chan practitioner's search for individual enlightenment.Landscape elements in the painting follow the meticulously descriptive style of the Southern Song Painting Academy. The angular contours of the figures' fluttering drapery lines are flat and conventionalized, however, and suggest an early fourteenth-century date for the piece.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP235490.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/40439
Box with Geometric Designs,China,late 17th century,"The five distinct geometric patterns on this box are composed of extraordinarily small, thin fragments of pearl shell.

Fragments of pearl shell were sometimes tinted or painted on the back to enhance their natural colors, such as pink and green.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP138471.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/60912
The Palace of Nine Perfections,Yuan Jiang,1691,"Yuan Jiang thrived in the commercial world of his native Yangzhou. Catering to the vogue for large-scale hanging scrolls and multipaneled screen paintings as decoration in the ostentatious mansions of the city’s mercantile elite, Yuan specialized in intricate visions of palatial complexes set within sumptuous blue-and-green landscapes intended to evoke Tang and Song prototypes.This screenlike set of scrolls depicts an eighth-century imperial retreat in the hills north of the Tang capital, Chang’an (present-day Xi’an). Destroyed by the end of the Tang dynasty (618C907), the Palace of Nine Perfections is remembered as one of the most splendid residences ever built, with grounds so vast that it was necessary to travel between halls by horseback.Royal palaces have always been likened to Daoist paradises, and Yuan’s vision plays on this theme, with Qing-style palatial buildings set in a fantastic landscape that suggests the enchanted realm of the immortals. But Yuan may have had another model in mind. Executed just two years after the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662C1722) visited Yangzhou on his second southern inspection tour, the painting, which includes a regal entourage―with the emperor and his parasol-bearer prominently featured in the foreground―was undoubtedly also inspired by the ceremonial processions and lavish gardens created to celebrate the imperial visit. Combining legend and architectural fantasy with thinly veiled references to contemporary events, Yuan’s painting is a celebration of the grandiose materialistic lifestyle to which the high society of Yangzhou aspired.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP274140.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/49227
Unfolding Landscape,Zheng Chongbin,2015,"Zheng Chongbin first trained as a figure painter, learning to control line and heavy mineral pigments in the painstaking “meticulous brush” manner. In the 1980s, he began to experiment with bold, gestural brushwork and the uncontrollable effects of mixing ink with white acrylic. In recent years, Zheng has used this technique, now a core part of his practice, to explore the landscape tradition. Unfolding Landscape renders both natural forms and natural forces out of the accidental interactions of his materials―fractals and capillaries read as tree branches, gray eddies as clouds, blocks of black ink as cliffs. Though apparently driven by the artist’s gesture, Zheng cedes much of the creative power to these natural interactions.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP-14098-018.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/712209

"Sword, Scabbard, and Belt Hook",Tibetan,"blade, ca. 16thC17th century; hilt, scabbard, and belt, ca. early 18thCmid-19th century","The sinuous wood-grain pattern running down the center of the blade is among the most intricate and beautiful on any Tibetan sword in existence. The gold-and-silver decoration of the hilt and scabbard is also of the highest quality for the period. Lieutenant Edward Henry Lenon (1838C1893) captured the sword in China at the Battle of North Taku Fort on August 21, 1860, during the Second Opium War. Lenon was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in this battle.This sword is important for the quality and distinctiveness of its pattern welded blade; as an excellent example of a Tibetan sword made to be worn suspended from a sword belt in the Chinese fashion; for its overall state of preservation; and for its interesting provenance. The pattern welding technique used in the forging of the vast majority of traditional Tibetan blades results in a characteristic surface appearance consisting of a series of alternating light and dark v-shaped lines referred to as a ""hairpin"" pattern. This example is exceptional among the few Tibetan blades that vary from this norm. In addition, the great length of the blade and the style of mounting made to be worn in the Chinese fashion associate it with a small group of similarly outfitted Tibetan swords, all with highly decorated hilts and scabbards.The hilt consists of an iron trefoil-shaped pommel with broad, flat sides; a grip wrapped horizontally in plain silver wire; an iron collar at the base of the grip; and an iron guard with rounded ends, cusped edges, down turned sides and an open, hollow interior. The sides of the pommel and the grip collar are damascened in gold (gold wire burnished onto to a finely crosshatched ground) with short repeating diagonal bands containing a stylized swastika pattern. In the center of the back of the pommel there is a small iron ring attached to a circular petal-shaped silver base. The front of the pommel is blank, but was originally decorated with a coral or turquoise stone set in silver. In the center of the grip collar there is an inset gilt copper plaque with a symmetrical leaf motif. The top of the guard is decorated with a recessed band and the sides are chiseled with a repeating trefoil pattern; both the band and the trefoil pattern are damascened in gold. The straight single-edged blade has a short oblique tip and a prominent band of variegated pattern welding running from the base of the blade to approximately two inches from the tip.The long rectangular scabbard has an iron frame covering the full length of both sides and the bottom. A recessed border runs the entire length of the front of the frame and is chiseled with a repeating scroll motif damascened in gold. The sides and bottom of the frame are damascened in gold with short repeating diagonal bands containing a stylized swastika pattern. The back of the frame is undecorated. The top six inches and the bottom nine inches of the front of the scabbard are covered by an inset pierced gilt copper panel of lush scrolling foliage and blossoms. Between the panels the wooden core of the scabbard is covered in green leather over two parallel concave channels running lengthwise on either side of a central ridge. The entire length of the back of the scabbard is covered in green leather. Two iron suspension brackets, chiseled and damascened in gold, are attached to the top edge of the frame for the straps from the sword belt. Each bracket has a short pivoting crossbar in the center. A decorative band wraps around the scabbard at each bracket and comprises a hemispherical coral bead set in a gilt copper circular bezel edged with petals and on top of a leafy silver base. The back strap is incised with a simple Greek key motif.The matching belt hook is made of iron highlighted with gold damascened decoration. It comprises a small buckle attached to a swivel hook that rotates at the top of a short rectangular slot, which is hinged to a large open loop.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/DP330538.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/647860

Hilt of a Ritual Sword,Tibetan,16thC17th century,"Originally fitted with a proportionately small blade, perhaps ten inches long, this hilt symbolizes the Sword of Wisdom, used to sever ties to spiritual and temporal ignorance and drive out the demons of negative thoughts and actions, particularly in the context of rituals associated with the Buddhist deities Manjushri, Padmasambhava, and Palden Lhamo. In addition to the use of such swords in actual rituals and ceremonies, iconographically, swords of this type appear in Tibetan scroll paintings (thang ka), wall murals, sculptures and other works of art, usually wielded by protective deities. They are also depicted among the objects required for votive or ritual use and are shown in great detail in a manuscript of ritual practices prepared for the Great Fifth Dalai Lama in the seventeenth century.The hilt is cast in one piece, with decoration in low relief accented by engraved details. The pommel has a trilobate or trefoil form and probably represents the Three-Eyed Gem (Tibetan,nor bu mig gsum pa), which is derived from the Chineseju-imotif and is one of a group of auspicious symbols known in Tibet as the Seven Gems (norbu cha bdun). It is decorated on the front with three dots framed by curly leaves or scrolls. The sides and back of the pommel are plain and there is a square opening at the top. The grip swells at the center and is round in cross section. It is decorated all the way around with two rows of stylized lotus petals. The borders or collars at the top and bottom of the grip consist of a continuous circle of triple petal orju-isymbols set on a beaded ring. At the base of the grip the guard is a very leonine form ofkirttimukhamask (Tibetan,tsi pa Ta) with a short downward curving leafy scroll extending from either side of the mouth. Ringlets of curly hair create an arc across the top of the back of the guard. Two locks or tendrils extend upward from the base, representing hair on the lower lip or chin of the mask. The bottom of the guard is open to accommodate the tang and shoulders of its missing blade. The opening is framed by teeth and fangs indicating the opening as the mouth of the mask, as is typical on hilts of this type.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/LC-TR_89_2017-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/747976

He wears a green undergarment with a wide hem decorated with floral patterns and a red monastic shawl with gold bands.

Boating amid Snowy Streams and Mountains,Lan Meng,mid-17th century,"Like many professional painters trained in family workshops, Lan Meng carried on the style established by his famous father, Lan Ying (1585Cca. 1664). Based in his hometown of Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province and center of the so-called Zhe school of commercial painting, Lan Meng specialized in monumental landscapes executed in mineral pigments on silk, but he also created intimate works on paper in the styles of fourteenth-century scholar-artists.Lan Meng's extant paintings date from 1643 to 1671; during the mid-1660s, he worked in the capital city of Beijing, where this painting was created. Snowscapes, featuring white pigment highlights on tree branches, were a particular specialty. Typically, Lan Meng attributed his inspiration to the Tang-dynasty poet-painter Wang Wei (699C759), whom the late Ming painter and critic Dong Qichang (1555C1636) regarded as the patriarch of scholar painting. But no reliable work by Wang had survived into the seventeenth century. Instead, Lan Meng evoked his memory by combining a tenth-century composition―tall mountains alongside a deep recession―with a landscape idiom derived from the scholar-painter Huang Gongwang (1269C1354).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/ASA21.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39628

Guan Yu,Unidentified artist,ca. 1700,"Guan Yu (d. A.D. 219), a warrior of the late Han dynasty (206 B.C.CA.D. 220) renowned for his valor and faithfulness, was later venerated as a saint in the Daoist pantheon. Elevated to the rank of emperor (di) by the Wanli emperor (r. 1573C1620) of the Ming dynasty, Guandi, as he was thenceforth known, served as a virtual patron saint of the Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty, who erected numerous shrines in his honor throughout China. In this image, Emperor Guan is shown descending from the heavens accompanied by his two attendants. He is identified by an inscription written in gold in the upper right: “Overseer of the Gate, Sage-Emperor Lord Guan.”The painting, which comes from a set of religious images used in “water and land” (shuilu) rituals, is distinguished by its high level of craftsmanship, intricate detail, and lavish use of mineral pigments. An inscription in the lower right, “Respectfully commissioned by the imperial prince Zhuang,” shows that the painting was the product of the imperial workshop.

Wan Shanglin's model is Ni Zan (1301C1374), the ultimate man of letters, and Wan's smoky ink and sensitive brushline are a respectable homage.Wan's inscription on this painting however, reveals a spirit characteristic of the 19th century, one that questioned the authenticity of accepted classics in literature, morals, history and painting. Wan writes that for eight or nine years he studied two paintings of the Longmen monk purported to be by Ni Zan and was still unable to decide whether they were genuine.

The entrance to a temple, like the front opening of this robe, has a tiger on one side (the west) and a dragon on the other (the east).Major figures on the back of the robe include the Jade Emperor (the large figure at the center back) and the Three Pure Ones, seen at the center top flanked by the sun and moon.

The glass paste, or enamel―which gets its color from metallic oxides―is painted into the contained areas of the design.

A yongzhong, recognized by its highly raised rims, is a type of bell found in great sets of graduated chimes known as bianzhong. Although it has a slightly raised rim, this bell is suspended from a ring rather than a long handle, making it a cross between the yongzhong and the bo types. Each face of the bell has three rows of bosses in the form of coiled serpents further divided by trapezoidal panels with faint dragon motifs.

Mount Huang,Arnold Chang,2012,"This collaborative album by photographer Michael Cherney and painter Arnold Chang challenges expectations by rendering a famous and easily recognizable site―the Yellow Mountains (Huangshan)―as a series of call-and-response abstractions between the lens and the brush. Cherney first took a photograph of Huangshan, then extracted from it a horizontal slice that he divided into twelve pieces (as seen in the illustration).

Lamellar Shoulder Defenses,Tibetan,14thC16th century,"The Met’s collection of armor and weapons from Tibet is the most comprehensive and well published in the world. This promised gift of a lamellar shoulder defense, made of iron lamellae joined by leather laces, adds yet another great strength to it. This defense for the neck and shoulders is the most complete example known of one the rarest forms of iron lamellar armor from Tibet. Lamellar armor is characterized by upwardly overlapping rows of small, finger-sized plates (lamellae), in which the individual lamellae, and the rows they create, are joined together by an intricate system of leather lacing, requiring no other internal support fabric or lining for its structure or functionality. It is an extremely old and widespread form of body armor, with archaeological examples of leather, bronze, and later iron lamellar armor found from East Asia to the Middle East, into Western Europe, over a period of more than a thousand years. Literary and iconographic evidence documents the regular use of lamellar armor across the Mongol empire by the thirteenth century. Virtually all surviving examples, from a non-archaeological context, however, come from Tibet, where it seems to have been the predominant form of body armor from about the fourteenth century to the seventeenth century, and remained in intermittent use into the twentieth century.Complete examples of Tibetan lamellar armor are rare and usually consist of a sleeveless coat with a distinct waist and comprise twelve to fourteen rows of lamellae. A few surviving examples have attached shoulder pieces and, in one instance, complete sleeves. A removable or independent neck and shoulder defense of the kind presented here is extremely rare, with only two or three fragmentary examples being known. However, the type, and how it was worn, is recorded in great detail inEighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute: The Story of Lady Wenji, an early fifteenth century Chinese painted scroll in The Met (acc. no. 1973.120.3). The scroll depicts several warriors in full lamellar armor equipped with shoulder pieces of this kind. In one particularly relevant scene, a seated commander is shown wearing complete armor, but with the neck and shoulder defense removed and being carried by his attendant. This invaluable pictorial evidence confirms the exact nature and use of this extremely rare form of lamellar armor.The lamellar armor is designed to cover the base of the neck, shoulders, and upper arms to about the elbows, mainly comprising a neck piece of a single row and two sleeves made up of eleven rows of iron lamellae joined by integral leather lacing. Seen from the outside, the lamellae of the neck piece overlap from right to left; the lamellae of the sleeves overlap from the back towards the front (left sleeve from right to left and right sleeve from left to right). The rows of the sleeves overlap upward and are laced in the typical manner for lamellar armor of this region and period. The individual lamellae measure about 2 ? in. by ? in. (7 x 1.9 cm) and are pierced with thirteen lacing holes each. The lamellae of the neck row are bent inward slightly to form a gentle curve and the row is fully lined with leather on its interior; there is a short row of ten lamellae loosely laced to the top edge of the center of the neck. The third row from the bottom of each sleeve is shorter by several lamellae on its inner aspect. There several colored textile laces arranged in a small loose bundle on the second row from the top of the right shoulder.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/aa/mobile-large/LC-L_2020_22_1a_b-001.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/788894

Parts of the tree even seem to be turning into dragons.

Surviving examples of women's formal court robes are rare: not many were made, as women were not often included in court ceremonies.

Musical Stone with Theme of the "Hundred Antiques",China,未知年代,"The association of bells and stone chimes with ancient ritual made them ideal subjects for reproduction as decorative objects. In the late eighteenth century, when the supply of jade was plentiful, archaistic bells and fanciful stone chimes were made from the precious material. The fashion for this type of jade object probably began in the imperial workshops during the Qianlong reign (1736C95) and continued in commercial enterprises through the nineteenth century.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP132700.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/43951

Covered Jar (Hu),China,1st century BCE,"During the Warring States period (475C221 B.C.), jades, bronze, textiles, musical instruments, books and other luxuries were often placed in tombs to serve the needs of the deceased in the afterlife. In the early Han dynasty pottery models known as mingqi or ""spirit goods"" began to be produced as substitutes for more valuable possessions, and to provide figures of servants, entertainers, livestock, pets, and vessels and other necessities for the tomb. Made of low-fired earthenware and painted with chalky mineral pigments that flake off when handled, this covered jar is too porous to hold liquids. The swirling cloud-like designs covering the vessel are thought to represent celestial mists through which the deceased would travel to join the immortals.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT8314.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/42367
Tomb Panel with Relief of Figures in a Pavilion,China,early 2nd century,"Distinguished by her larger size, bird-shaped cap, and flowing gown, the figure seated at the far left represents Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of the West. Thought to rule the land of the immortals (located somewhere to the west of China), Xiwangmu played a major role in Han funerary beliefs. The structured placement of Xiwangmu and her attendants in the pavilion is typical of later Han representations of heavenly courts, which under the influence of Confucianism, began to parallel the organization of earthly ones.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT5067.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44791

Spring Festival on the River,Unidentified artist,18th century?,"In the early twelfth century the court artist Zhang Zeduan painted a handscroll depicting the Northern Song capital of Bianliang (Kaifeng) at the time of the Spring Festival (Qingming jie). Zhang's painting, which lovingly and minutely describes the daily life of the capital's inhabitants, became the paradigm for more than forty later evocations of this theme. This version, which is longer, compositionally more complex, and more brilliantly colored than the Song original, reflects the stylistic innovations of the Suzhou professional painter Qiu Ying (ca. 1495C1552), whose signature has been added at the end. But there are several reasons for assigning the scroll to a later date. Not only is the execution less meticulous than that of genuine works by Qiu, but the addition of elaborate palaces, a display of horsemanship and archery skills, an imperial procession, and a hunt― none of which appear in the original―point to the influence of imperially sponsored commemorative paintings that originated with the Southern Inspection Tour of the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662C1722).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP120039_CRD.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/36048

Incense Burner,China,17thC18th century,"Much Chinese art is informed by a complex understanding of the past. The shape of this incense burner is a fascinating example of this tendency, having been derived from a ceramic of the Southern Song dynasty (1127C1279) that was itself inspired by an archaic ritual vessel used during the Bronze Age. The addition of a matching stand, on the other hand, can be traced to the seventeenth century, as can the alchemical treatment of the bronze, which creates a sense of surface depth comparable to that found in glazed porcelains.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/61108

Festival Robe,China,18th century,"The unusual green tone of the robe derives from peacock feather filaments that were individually twisted by hand onto the threads used to embroider the garment. Robes made in this laborious fashion were valued both for the work entailed and for their exotic quality as the peacock is not native to China. Textual sources trace the use of peacock feather filaments to the fifth century. The earliest surviving examples are fragments unearthed from the tomb of Ming Emperor Wanli (1572C1620) in a suburb of Beijing in the 1950s. A robe similar to this one is now in the collection of the Palace Museum, Beijing.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/189239.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/68561

Textile with Coiled Dragons,China,未知年代,"This textile represents the tradition of northern China's Jin dynasty, which was known for textiles brocaded in gold with offset asymmetrical motifs on a solid-colored background. The motif here is a coiled dragon with a flaming jewel. The coiled dragon, as a pattern for princes' robes, dates from the Tang dynasty and was also used for garments in the Song and Xixia dynasties. This example is an early instance of a dragon with five claws. It is woven in a variant of the brocading technique first seen in a Jin-dynasty princely tomb of 1162.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DT5068.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/39740
Censer with figures in landscape,China,1707,"The thickly potted censer stands on three small feet and is painted with a continuous landscape of mountains and rivers. Three scholars are shown boating on one side while another two stand on a promontory overlooking the view. Signs of habitation are also found in the pavilion nestled along the sides of the river, and the two small thatched huts on the river banks. The full moon in the sky and the flying geese add a seasonal element to the scene as do the budding trees. It seems likely that the painting, rendered in dramatic shades of light and dark cobalt, represents a moment in either autumn or spring. A four character inscription in cobalt blue in a round cartouche on the bottom reads dinghai nian zhi (丁亥年之), a cyclical date with corresponds with 1708.

Panel with five phoenixes in a garden,China,18th century,"Large pictorial silk tapestries such as these were woven mostly in the imperial workshops in Suzhou, a textile center in southeast China. The background of bright yellow, a color exclusive to the emperor, further confirms the imperial origins. Though usually translated as “phoenix” in English, the fenghuang bird is a distinct mythical species with a different set of associations.

Decorative motifs on Machang-period wares are largely geometric and include curvilinear patterns and cross-hatching, and lozenges, triangles, circles, and squares in an endless array of combinations. The zoomorphic figure in the center of this jar is one of the more distinctive images in the Machang vocabulary. Four limbs, bent in the center, are attached to a long torso, capped by a small head. Feathers or some other type of tufting are found at the end of the upper limbs and at the joints of all four appendages. These enigmatic motifs are variously interpreted: they are sometimes explained as abstract representations of natural creatures such as frogs; other hypotheses suggest that they are symbolic of either the costume worn by a shaman or the transformation he undergoes during rituals.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/as/mobile-large/DP341154.jpg,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/44722

Theatrical jacket with dragons,China,18th century,"This impressive ensemble (with 30.76.19) features a striking dragon on the front and large triangle-shaped sleeves. Garments of this sort are often characterized as arhat robes (luohanyi) that would have been worn to play monks in dramas based on Buddhist history. However, no direct evidence confirms this theory. The numerous robes of this type preserved in the Forbidden City in Beijing (and elsewhere) and their varied decoration suggest that this form of dress was used by multiple kinds of actors in large-scale court performances.On view during Rotation 1 of exhibition from June 25, 2016 through January 13, 2017.",,https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/69000
