Tea Table with Figures in a Chinese Formal Garden,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"<P></P>Highly refined lacquer furniture―generally in the form of chests or cabinets made in China and Japan for their domestic markets―was available, in limited quantities, in Europe from as early as the mid-seventeenth century. These costly and cherished objects were found in many of Europe’s most prestigious households, where they were often raised on stands with elaborate gilded or japanned (the European version of lacquer) decoration. 

<P></P>By the early nineteenth century, the fashion for Asian lacquerware had reached the middle classes in Europe and the United States. In response, Asian craftsmen began to manufacture Western-style lacquer furniture such as this example. This table was made for Philadelphian John A. Lewis while he was in China. Lewis’s father was in the China trade and when he died, John and his brother took over the business, which was located at the southeast corner of Walnut and Front Streets in Philadelphia.

Sutra Cover,Artist/maker unknown,Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),"<P></P>Buddhist scriptures, or sutras, that are bound accordion-style are often protected with covers composed of paperboard wrapped in decorative silk. Titles and volume numbers appear on strips of paper adhered to the fabric. The use of silk for sutra covers dates back to at least the Tang dynasty (618C907), but most extant examples are from the Ming dynasty (1368C1644) and later, when the printing industry grew in China. In some cases, sutra printings were sponsored by the imperial government, resulting in superior editions based on texts from the palace collection.

<P></P>Complex weaves of lustrous silk, sometimes highlighted by metallic thread, made possible a wide array of patterns and motifs. These include floral scrolls, Buddhist emblems, traditional Chinese symbols of blessings, and Chinese characters with auspicious meanings, all of which are also found on Buddhist ritual vessels and implements made from lacquer, gold, silver, and porcelain. 

<P></P>In 1940 more than five hundred sutra covers, along with a significant assemblage of other textiles, were acquired from Carl Schuster, who served as assistant curator of Chinese art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1935 to 1937.

Platter,Artist/maker unknown,,"This platter was originally part of a large and important dinner service made to order in China for Gijsbert Jan Feith (1719C1775). Feith was born in the Netherlands but lived most of his life in the East Indies. He rose to some prominence in Batavia (modern Jakarta), the capital of the East Indies and the principal harbor for Dutch ships sailing to and from Europe, and likely ordered the service in 1763, the year in which he was appointed alderman of Batavia. Feith must have had an interest in family heraldry as he commissioned decoration that is unique for export porcelain: in addition to his own coat of arms, he included the arms and family names of his father, mother (van Hardenbroek), and her parents (Cock and Merlot).","https://iiif.micr.io/Uxewv/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/307760

Covered Vase,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) or Republican Period (1912-1949),"This vase, inspired in form by an ancient bronze, is unusual in that it has both Arabic and Chinese inscriptions. The Chinese phrase for “life everlasting” appears in a cartouche on either side of the Arabic inscription that pays tribute to the power of Allah. On the lip is the Chinese word <i>Yudetang</i>, which translates to “Hall of Bathing in Virtue.” Legend has it that the hall―located in the Forbidden City―was a Turkish-style bath built for the Qianlong emperor’s favorite Uighur concubine, who was captured when Chinese troops defeated her people as part of the empire’s plan to expand Qing territory. The Uighurs are a Muslim ethnic group located in the northwest part of China in today’s Xinjiang province, which explains the combination of Arabic and Chinese on this piece.","https://iiif.micr.io/ukHYE/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/168096

Vase,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"The flowering plum is one of the most beloved and enduring images in Chinese art, in part because it is among the first plants to bloom each spring. As a sixth-century poet noted, ""She alone has the gift of recognizing spring."" From the twelfth century on, an entire genre of painting was devoted to aspects of the flowering plum. On this spectacular vase, the artist has given us one interpretation: a night view with the tree set against the dark, black sky. The delicate blossoms contrast with the gnarled, aged trunk of the tree as both wrap around the contours of the perfectly formed vase.","https://iiif.micr.io/fisqj/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/55026

Scholar's Rock,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"<P>Rocks with extraordinary forms have been appreciated for their aesthetic merit by Chinese scholars for more than one thousand years. Traditionally, scholar's rocks were displayed in the intimate setting of the scholar's studio.  They are often mounted on finely fitted and carved wooden stands and placed in a spot where the scholar can gaze upon their form in quiet contemplation. </P>

<P>This majestic rock evokes the qualities of a monumental precipice in a mountainous Chinese landscape. Charcoal gray and streaked with white, the rock is especially striking when seen from the front and sides, which are covered with deep and long columnar shafts and deep, vertical furrows. The comparatively smooth back allows for a less obstructed view of two wonderful c-shaped hollows at the side of the rock. A large example such as this one might be placed directly on the floor, where it would evoke imagery of a mountainous landscape or one of the Isles of the Immortals. The wooden stand has a pleasing, undulating surface that is characteristic of 19th century stands.</P>

<P>This rock lets out a bell-like ring when struck, a quality that is highly prized by collectors.</P>","https://iiif.micr.io/jbUhF/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/197566

Sutra Cover,Artist/maker unknown,Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),"<P></P>Buddhist scriptures, or sutras, that are bound accordion-style are often protected with covers composed of paperboard wrapped in decorative silk. Titles and volume numbers appear on strips of paper adhered to the fabric.

<P></P>In 1940 more than five hundred sutra covers, along with a significant assemblage of other textiles, were acquired from Carl Schuster, who served as assistant curator of Chinese art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1935 to 1937. Schuster’s collection is an important resource for the study of Chinese textiles.","https://iiif.micr.io/cSpuP/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/185261

Sutra Cover,Artist/maker unknown,Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),"<P></P>Buddhist scriptures, or sutras, that are bound accordion-style are often protected with covers composed of paperboard wrapped in decorative silk. Titles and volume numbers appear on strips of paper adhered to the fabric. The use of silk for sutra covers dates back to at least the Tang dynasty (618C907), but most extant examples are from the Ming dynasty (1368C1644) and later, when the printing industry grew in China. In some cases, sutra printings were sponsored by the imperial government, resulting in superior editions based on texts from the palace collection.

The use of silk for sutra covers dates back to at least the Tang dynasty (618C907), but most extant examples are from the Ming dynasty (1368C1644) and later, when the printing industry grew in China. In some cases, sutra printings were sponsored by the imperial government, resulting in superior editions based on texts from the palace collection.

<P></P>Complex weaves of lustrous silk, sometimes highlighted by metallic thread, made possible a wide array of patterns and motifs. These include floral scrolls, Buddhist emblems, traditional Chinese symbols of blessings, and Chinese characters with auspicious meanings, all of which are also found on Buddhist ritual vessels and implements made from lacquer, gold, silver, and porcelain. 

<P></P>In 1940 more than five hundred sutra covers, along with a significant assemblage of other textiles, were acquired from Carl Schuster, who served as assistant curator of Chinese art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1935 to 1937.

Incense Burner,Artist/maker unknown,Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),"<P></P>Inscribed on the base (translated): I wonder if someone replaced the incense from last night. Surprisingly, the fragrance can still be smelled until now. The design (of the handles) was taken from the chong fish, and the color is like that of a patterned eel. There is no fire or smoke to begin with, but it seems like there is cloud and mist. After I finished distinguishing the eight transformations and discerning the true nature, how can I tell where the roots of my nose are?

<P></P>Composed by the Qianlong emperor in the mid-spring of the cyclical year of Bingshen (AD 1776)

<P></P>This incense burner demonstrates China’s deep reverence of its past. Most likely made during the Ming dynasty, its form is based on a thirteenth- to fourteenth-century Ge ware censer, which itself was modeled after an archaic bronze food offering vessel. The Qianlong emperor (ruled 1736C95) of the Qing dynasty (1644C1911) admired these historical aspects and had his sentiments carved into the base.

Inscription,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"The stone carvings collectively known as the Wu Family shrines are a series of organized pictorial elements and inscriptions forming a tomb discovered in China's Shandong province in 1786.  The stone reliefs however have been studied since the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279) through ink rubbings of their surface decoration and inscriptions.  These rubbings were created by placing paper over the surface of the stone and rubbing the paper with ink, transferring the stone texture to paper.  They are a commonly referenced historical source for the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), but they often only selectively represent the stone surface and were in some cases likely altered to depict the ""original"" stone, eroding their reliability.  Scholars now interpret the rubbings both as representations of the stone carving and pictorial traditions of the Han dynasty in which the stones were created, and also as a revealing look at attitudes towards the study of antiquity in the Song dynasty (and later years) in which the rubbings entered the study of history.

Inscription,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"The stone carvings collectively known as the Wu Family shrines are a series of organized pictorial elements and inscriptions forming a tomb discovered in China's Shandong province in 1786.  The stone reliefs however have been studied since the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279) through ink rubbings of their surface decoration and inscriptions.  These rubbings were created by placing paper over the surface of the stone and rubbing the paper with ink, transferring the stone texture to paper.  They are a commonly referenced historical source for the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), but they often only selectively represent the stone surface and were in some cases likely altered to depict the ""original"" stone, eroding their reliability.  Scholars now interpret the rubbings both as representations of the stone carving and pictorial traditions of the Han dynasty in which the stones were created, and also as a revealing look at attitudes towards the study of antiquity in the Song dynasty (and later years) in which the rubbings entered the study of history.

Reception Hall,Artist/maker unknown,Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),"This painted chamber, built in the early 1600s, was once the main reception hall in a palatial compound in the Chinese capital city of Beijing. Wang Cheng-en, a eunuch in the service of the last Ming dynasty ruler, built the compound, and it later came to be known by the name of a subsequent owner, Duke Zhao.  

<P>The palatial residence, like a traditional family compound, was built on a rectangular plan, facing south, and surrounded by a wall. The reception hall, the most formal of the many buildings, would have been located on the central axis, not far from the south gate. Here, Wang Cheng-en would have received guests and petitioners. The white plaster and brick walls and tile floor are modern replacements, but the rest is original, from the marble bases of the great lacquered wooden columns to the peak of the roof.</P>

<P>As in all East Asian buildings, in contrast to Western architecture, the structure of the roof is greatly emphasized. All of the supporting members of the immensely heavy tile roof have been left exposed, and are accentuated by surface decoration. Although some of the brilliantly painted decoration has been lost, the effect is still one of dignified beauty. The hall is furnished with lacquer storage chests, a dog cage, porcelains, jades, and imperial jewelry. The Crozier Collection of rock crystal, formerly part of the Chinese Imperial Collection, is also displayed here in cases.</P>","https://iiif.micr.io/bWGgV/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/42422

Sutra Covers: Complete Book,Artist/maker unknown,Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),"<P></P>Buddhist scriptures, or sutras, that are bound accordion-style are often protected with covers composed of paperboard wrapped in decorative silk. Titles and volume numbers appear on strips of paper adhered to the fabric. The use of silk for sutra covers dates back to at least the Tang dynasty (618C907), but most extant examples are from the Ming dynasty (1368C1644) and later, when the printing industry grew in China. In some cases, sutra printings were sponsored by the imperial government, resulting in superior editions based on texts from the palace collection.

<P></P>Complex weaves of lustrous silk, sometimes highlighted by metallic thread, made possible a wide array of patterns and motifs. These include floral scrolls, Buddhist emblems, traditional Chinese symbols of blessings, and Chinese characters with auspicious meanings, all of which are also found on Buddhist ritual vessels and implements made from lacquer, gold, silver, and porcelain. 

<P></P>In 1940 more than five hundred sutra covers, along with a significant assemblage of other textiles, were acquired from Carl Schuster, who served as assistant curator of Chinese art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1935 to 1937. Schuster’s collection is an important resource for the study of Chinese textiles.","https://iiif.micr.io/vkZje/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/147322

Sutra Covers: Complete Book,Artist/maker unknown,Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),"<P></P>Buddhist scriptures, or sutras, that are bound accordion-style are often protected with covers composed of paperboard wrapped in decorative silk. Titles and volume numbers appear on strips of paper adhered to the fabric. The use of silk for sutra covers dates back to at least the Tang dynasty (618C907), but most extant examples are from the Ming dynasty (1368C1644) and later, when the printing industry grew in China. In some cases, sutra printings were sponsored by the imperial government, resulting in superior editions based on texts from the palace collection.

<P></P>Complex weaves of lustrous silk, sometimes highlighted by metallic thread, made possible a wide array of patterns and motifs. These include floral scrolls, Buddhist emblems, traditional Chinese symbols of blessings, and Chinese characters with auspicious meanings, all of which are also found on Buddhist ritual vessels and implements made from lacquer, gold, silver, and porcelain. 

<P></P>In 1940 more than five hundred sutra covers, along with a significant assemblage of other textiles, were acquired from Carl Schuster, who served as assistant curator of Chinese art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1935 to 1937. Schuster’s collection is an important resource for the study of Chinese textiles.","https://iiif.micr.io/wOHHR/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/147324

Snuff Bottle,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"<P>Snuff-made of tobacco that is ground into a powdered form and spiced with aromatic substances-was introduced to China from Japan in the late seventeenth century. Chinese elites believed that the powder had medicinal properties, and initially used cylindrical medicine bottles to hold this new ""Japanese tobacco."" Soon after, the Kangxi Emperor (reigned 1662 - 1722)-known for his fondness for snuff and a devoted patron of the arts-established a series of workshops in Beijing to manufacture small, high-quality objects for court use, including snuff bottles. The repertoire of bottle shapes, materials, and motifs dramatically expanded under imperial patronage, and artisans facilitated the dispensing of the tobacco by adding stoppers with attached ivory spoons.</P>

<P>Snuff bottle production reached aesthetic and technological heights during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1736 - 1795), who particularly appreciated the artfulness of the miniature containers. Members of the Qianlong court frequently exchanged the exquisite receptacles as gifts, and by the mid-nineteenth century, snuff bottles had become mandatory items of apparel for Chinese gentlemen and those who aspired to this status. The popularization of these vessels helps account for the many glass bottles produced to resemble jade, agate, quartz, lapis lazuli, and other precious materials: glass snuff bottles were less expensive and a good imitation passed all but the closest scrutiny. Chinese interest in snuff bottles as collectibles continued into the twentieth century, when delicate, inside-painted wares dominated the market.</P>","https://iiif.micr.io/iYeFZ/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/262797

In the work by Qian Xuan, the men drank from cups mounted on cup stands, which were commonly used during the Song dynasty (960-1279). The nineteenth-century artist who painted this scroll must have had only a muddled understanding of cup stands, as he has rendered them here as stacks of small cups.","https://iiif.micr.io/ngOaq/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/42881

Cover,Artist/maker unknown,,"<P></P>Buddhist scriptures, or sutras, that are bound accordion-style are often protected with covers composed of paperboard wrapped in decorative silk. Titles and volume numbers appear on strips of paper adhered to the fabric. The use of silk for sutra covers dates back to at least the Tang dynasty (618C907), but most extant examples are from the Ming dynasty (1368C1644) and later, when the printing industry grew in China. In some cases, sutra printings were sponsored by the imperial government, resulting in superior editions based on texts from the palace collection.

<P></P>Complex weaves of lustrous silk, sometimes highlighted by metallic thread, made possible a wide array of patterns and motifs. These include floral scrolls, Buddhist emblems, traditional Chinese symbols of blessings, and Chinese characters with auspicious meanings, all of which are also found on Buddhist ritual vessels and implements made from lacquer, gold, silver, and porcelain. 

<P></P>In 1940 more than five hundred sutra covers, along with a significant assemblage of other textiles, were acquired from Carl Schuster, who served as assistant curator of Chinese art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1935 to 1937. Schuster’s collection is an important resource for the study of Chinese textiles.","https://iiif.micr.io/SASaa/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/147318

Snuff Bottle - Mythical Figures and Creatures,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"<P>Snuff-made of tobacco that is ground into a powdered form and spiced with aromatic substances-was introduced to China from Japan in the late seventeenth century.

Female Immortals,Artist/maker unknown,Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368),"Three female immortals wear cloaks and skirts made of grasses and leaves. Their hairy bodies identify them as the Feathered Women (<i>mao nü</i>) of Daoist lore, who live deep in the mountains searching for herbs. Here they show each other what they have gathered. The figure at the far left holds a lingzhi fungus (thought to bestow longevity if ingested) and a basket of plants is draped over her arm. The focus of the painting is on a large health-benefiting ginseng root displayed in the hand of the central immortal. Other herbs depicted include leaves of banana and palm tree carried in the baskets on the women’s backs. The representation of Feathered Women exhibiting precious medicinal items functions as a special talisman, protecting the owner from illness.","https://iiif.micr.io/CYXOC/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/42846

Sutra Cover,Artist/maker unknown,Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),"<P></P>Buddhist scriptures, or sutras, that are bound accordion-style are often protected with covers composed of paperboard wrapped in decorative silk. Titles and volume numbers appear on strips of paper adhered to the fabric. The use of silk for sutra covers dates back to at least the Tang dynasty (618C907), but most extant examples are from the Ming dynasty (1368C1644) and later, when the printing industry grew in China. In some cases, sutra printings were sponsored by the imperial government, resulting in superior editions based on texts from the palace collection.

<P></P>Complex weaves of lustrous silk, sometimes highlighted by metallic thread, made possible a wide array of patterns and motifs. These include floral scrolls, Buddhist emblems, traditional Chinese symbols of blessings, and Chinese characters with auspicious meanings, all of which are also found on Buddhist ritual vessels and implements made from lacquer, gold, silver, and porcelain. 

<P></P>In 1940 more than five hundred sutra covers, along with a significant assemblage of other textiles, were acquired from Carl Schuster, who served as assistant curator of Chinese art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1935 to 1937. Schuster’s collection is an important resource for the study of Chinese textiles.","https://iiif.micr.io/OXfgE/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/147211

The clay used in such pieces was first found in Yixing, near Lake Tai in Jiangsu province. Admired by connoisseurs for its harmonization with complex tea flavors, Yixing ware teapots become more valuable over time as repeated brewing and steeping seasons the vessel and enhances the flavor of each serving. The virtue of this miniature teapot lies in its capacity-if the pot is emptied in one pouring, the tea leaves will not stew and the delicate flavor and aroma will not be degraded.

Fifty-Three Compassionate Manifestations of Guanyin,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"Since being introduced to China in the 200s, different forms of the popular <P></P>Buddhist deity, Guanyin (Sanskrit: <i>Avalokiteshvara</i>), have been created by Chinese devotees and artists. An enlightened being who vowed to remain in this world to help others achieve enlightenment, the compassionate bodhisattva Guanyin can assume different forms in response to individual’s needs. 
<P></P>This woodblock is part of the book <i>Fifty-Three Compassionate Manifestations of Guanyin</i>, which was originally produced in the early 1600s, and contains images of Guanyin in his many different manifestations. Published to disseminate popular beliefs surrounding this deity, the book encompasses all the well-known forms such as White-robed, Water Moon, and Child-granting Guanyin, and also includes remarkably inventive versions of the deity appearing as the Buddha and even a European gentleman. Rendered in the fine-line (<i>baimiao</i>) technique associated with the celebrated painter of Buddhist figures, Ding Yunpeng (1547-1621), the illustrations are accompanied by an essay by Hu Yingling (1551-1602), a noted scholar who cited various stories demonstrating the efficacy of Guanyin.
<P></P>The Museum’s nineteen printed images, each now mounted as an album leaf, depicts an image of Guanyin accompanied by a related Chan-Buddhist poem, which differs in composition from most other extant examples printed in the 1700s and 1800s. Unusual also are the many depictions of the Buddhist guardian, Weituo, and inscriptions stating that publication of this book was funded by a Buddhist follower, Hou Huai.

"The Factories of Canton, China",Artist/maker unknown,,"<P></P>Beginning in 1784, many Philadelphia merchants engaged with the China trade, and proudly owned paintings of their establishment in Canton (Guangzhou), the only port that admitted foreigners. The international community was restricted to a narrow strip of land along the Pearl River, where “hongs” were rented by the different trading nations, represented by the Danish, Austrian, American, Swedish, British, and Dutch flags that line Respondentia Walk in this painting. These buildings included storerooms, offices, a bank vault, and dwelling space for the foreign work force and their Chinese servants.

<P></P>This unusually large and detailed image by an unknown Chinese painter (who probably specialized in this kind of souvenir) descended in the family of Anthony Morris Buckley (1777-1845), who went to China in 1799. Although his ship was captured by privateers, Buckley returned safely to Philadelphia in the summer of 1800. It is not clear how he got this image home; perhaps he ordered the painting when he was in Canton, and it was delivered later on another vessel. The patronage of the image seems clear from the central placement of the American flag, immediately above a Chinese junk that bears an eagle on its stern boards.  Such vessels ferried goods to the ocean-going ships harbored at Whampoa, further south on the river, closer to the sea.

Zhong Kui the Demon Queller,Artist/maker unknown,Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) or later,"<P></P>Known as the fearless captor of ghosts and evil spirits in both China and Japan, Zhong Kui is one of the most frequently portrayed figures of Chinese folklore. Supernatural stories about Zhong appear early on in the Song dynasty (960C1279), where it is accounted that he subjugated two demons for Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang dynasty (618C906). Based on this legend, portraits of Zhong are hung during the Lunar New Year to help expel evil spirits.

<P></P>This painting shows the stout Zhong Kui wearing ceremonial attire of an official, holding a stack of books in one hand and carrying a stringed instrument under his other arm. This is most likely intended to demonstrate the cultural refinement of this boorish-looking warrior, who, as the legend relates, once achieved top rank in the civil service examination.

Rendered in the fine-line (<i>baimiao</i>) technique associated with the celebrated painter of Buddhist figures, Ding Yunpeng (1547-1621), the illustrations are accompanied by an essay by Hu Yingling (1551-1602), a noted scholar who cited various stories demonstrating the efficacy of Guanyin.

<P></P>This rare example demonstrates the elegance and splendor of snuff bottles with enameled relief designs on gilded backgrounds. The raised ornamentation and lotus petals around the lower neck play off the characters lian ding, meaning continuous male offspring, and the six petal-shaped panels on the body are decorated with formalized floral scrolls, creating an emblem for longevity by virtue of their elongated, meandering vines.

Vase,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"<p>The scene on this vase depicts the Battle of Sishui Pass, an episode from the novel <i>Investiture of the Gods</i>, written in the 1500s. The book, part fact and part fantasy, recounts events that occurred in China during the wars between the Shang and Zhou dynasties more than three thousand years ago.</p> 

<p>Literary depictions on porcelains became popular in the 1700s thanks to the novels that had become widely accessible. Artists used woodblock prints illustrating the stories as a source for their designs. </p>

<p>Auspicious Decoration</p>

<p>The neck of this vase holds the three Star Gods―representing Longevity, Happiness, and Wealth―surrounded by young boys, one of which plays the mouth organ. This grouping is a visual pun wishing for the continual advancement of sons within the ranks of officialdom.</p>

The stone reliefs however have been studied since the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279) through ink rubbings of their surface decoration and inscriptions.  These rubbings were created by placing paper over the surface of the stone and rubbing the paper with ink, transferring the stone texture to paper.  They are a commonly referenced historical source for the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), but they often only selectively represent the stone surface and were in some cases likely altered to depict the ""original"" stone, eroding their reliability.  Scholars now interpret the rubbings both as representations of the stone carving and pictorial traditions of the Han dynasty in which the stones were created, and also as a revealing look at attitudes towards the study of antiquity in the Song dynasty (and later years) in which the rubbings entered the study of history.

Inscription,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"The stone carvings collectively known as the Wu Family shrines are a series of organized pictorial elements and inscriptions forming a tomb discovered in China's Shandong province in 1786.  The stone reliefs however have been studied since the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279) through ink rubbings of their surface decoration and inscriptions.  These rubbings were created by placing paper over the surface of the stone and rubbing the paper with ink, transferring the stone texture to paper.  They are a commonly referenced historical source for the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), but they often only selectively represent the stone surface and were in some cases likely altered to depict the ""original"" stone, eroding their reliability.  Scholars now interpret the rubbings both as representations of the stone carving and pictorial traditions of the Han dynasty in which the stones were created, and also as a revealing look at attitudes towards the study of antiquity in the Song dynasty (and later years) in which the rubbings entered the study of history.

Snuff Bottle with Five-Clawed Dragon Chasing a Pearl,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"<P>Snuff-made of tobacco that is ground into a powdered form and spiced with aromatic substances-was introduced to China from Japan in the late seventeenth century. Chinese elites believed that the powder had medicinal properties, and initially used cylindrical medicine bottles to hold this new ""Japanese tobacco."" Soon after, the Kangxi Emperor (reigned 1662 - 1722)-known for his fondness for snuff and a devoted patron of the arts-established a series of workshops in Beijing to manufacture small, high-quality objects for court use, including snuff bottles. The repertoire of bottle shapes, materials, and motifs dramatically expanded under imperial patronage, and artisans facilitated the dispensing of the tobacco by adding stoppers with attached ivory spoons.</P>

<P>Snuff bottle production reached aesthetic and technological heights during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1736 - 1795), who particularly appreciated the artfulness of the miniature containers. Members of the Qianlong court frequently exchanged the exquisite receptacles as gifts, and by the mid-nineteenth century, snuff bottles had become mandatory items of apparel for Chinese gentlemen and those who aspired to this status.

This example was acquired by the Museum in Beijing, where similar interiors may still be seen in the palaces of the former Forbidden City.

<P>The study is furnished in a style typical of the period. The hardwood (<i>huanghuali</i>) seen at the back left is of the ""kneehole"" type, long popular in China. It offered ample room for storing the scholar's books, brushes, and writing equipment. The long, narrow table at the right front was designed for painting or looking at scrolls.</P>

<P>The occupant of the study was most likely a highly ranked mandarin, or civil official, who had passed a series of difficult competitive examinations in the Chinese classics in order to attain his position. He was versed not only in the duties of his office but also in music, poetry, and the arts of calligraphy and painting, and was a connoisseur of art with a keen interest in collecting.</P>","https://iiif.micr.io/wixEK/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/42577

Purnabhadra,Artist/maker unknown,,"Purnabhadra, whose name means “He Who Is Replete with Goodness,” is the king of a group of wealth guardians called yakshas and an attendant to Vaishravana, Guardian of the North, Protector of Wealth and Buddhist teachings. Purnabhadra holds a vase brimming with jewels and an obese mongoose with eight auspicious items spilling from its mouth. The mongoose represents wealth both because it preys on snakes―the traditional custodians of wealth― and because mongoose pelts were once used to make money bags.

Fifty-Three Compassionate Manifestations of Guanyin,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"Since being introduced to China in the 200s, different forms of the popular <P></P>Buddhist deity, Guanyin (Sanskrit: <i>Avalokiteshvara</i>), have been created by Chinese devotees and artists. An enlightened being who vowed to remain in this world to help others achieve enlightenment, the compassionate bodhisattva Guanyin can assume different forms in response to individual’s needs. 
<P></P>This woodblock is part of the book <i>Fifty-Three Compassionate Manifestations of Guanyin</i>, which was originally produced in the early 1600s, and contains images of Guanyin in his many different manifestations. Published to disseminate popular beliefs surrounding this deity, the book encompasses all the well-known forms such as White-robed, Water Moon, and Child-granting Guanyin, and also includes remarkably inventive versions of the deity appearing as the Buddha and even a European gentleman. Rendered in the fine-line (<i>baimiao</i>) technique associated with the celebrated painter of Buddhist figures, Ding Yunpeng (1547-1621), the illustrations are accompanied by an essay by Hu Yingling (1551-1602), a noted scholar who cited various stories demonstrating the efficacy of Guanyin.
<P></P>The Museum’s nineteen printed images, each now mounted as an album leaf, depicts an image of Guanyin accompanied by a related Chan-Buddhist poem, which differs in composition from most other extant examples printed in the 1700s and 1800s. Unusual also are the many depictions of the Buddhist guardian, Weituo, and inscriptions stating that publication of this book was funded by a Buddhist follower, Hou Huai.","https://iiif.micr.io/AbwTw/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/170882

Snuff Bottle with Seal Decoration and Imperial Inscription,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"<P></P>The red inscriptions are seal marks.  The inscription in black on one side is a poem ""Red Leaves,"" written by imperial command of the Qianlong Emperor (translated): 

<P>Autumn sets the glorious trees blazing with colors,<BR> 
Opposite each other, we quietly park our carriages;<BR>
My guest, the Director of Merit awards, is known as Mu Zhi</P>

<P>Snuff-made of tobacco that is ground into a powdered form and spiced with aromatic substances-was introduced to China from Japan in the late seventeenth century. Chinese elites believed that the powder had medicinal properties, and initially used cylindrical medicine bottles to hold this new ""Japanese tobacco."" Soon after, the Kangxi Emperor (reigned 1662 - 1722)-known for his fondness for snuff and a devoted patron of the arts-established a series of workshops in Beijing to manufacture small, high-quality objects for court use, including snuff bottles. The repertoire of bottle shapes, materials, and motifs dramatically expanded under imperial patronage, and artisans facilitated the dispensing of the tobacco by adding stoppers with attached ivory spoons.</P>

<P>Snuff bottle production reached aesthetic and technological heights during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1736 - 1795), who particularly appreciated the artfulness of the miniature containers. Members of the Qianlong court frequently exchanged the exquisite receptacles as gifts, and by the mid-nineteenth century, snuff bottles had become mandatory items of apparel for Chinese gentlemen and those who aspired to this status. The popularization of these vessels helps account for the many glass bottles produced to resemble jade, agate, quartz, lapis lazuli, and other precious materials: glass snuff bottles were less expensive and a good imitation passed all but the closest scrutiny. Chinese interest in snuff bottles as collectibles continued into the twentieth century, when delicate, inside-painted wares dominated the market.</P>

The practice was revived in the Qing dynasty.

Snuff Bottle and Stopper,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"<P>Snuff-made of tobacco that is ground into a powdered form and spiced with aromatic substances-was introduced to China from Japan in the late seventeenth century. Chinese elites believed that the powder had medicinal properties, and initially used cylindrical medicine bottles to hold this new ""Japanese tobacco."" Soon after, the Kangxi Emperor (reigned 1662 - 1722)-known for his fondness for snuff and a devoted patron of the arts-established a series of workshops in Beijing to manufacture small, high-quality objects for court use, including snuff bottles. The repertoire of bottle shapes, materials, and motifs dramatically expanded under imperial patronage, and artisans facilitated the dispensing of the tobacco by adding stoppers with attached ivory spoons.</P>

<P>Snuff bottle production reached aesthetic and technological heights during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1736 - 1795), who particularly appreciated the artfulness of the miniature containers. Members of the Qianlong court frequently exchanged the exquisite receptacles as gifts, and by the mid-nineteenth century, snuff bottles had become mandatory items of apparel for Chinese gentlemen and those who aspired to this status. The popularization of these vessels helps account for the many glass bottles produced to resemble jade, agate, quartz, lapis lazuli, and other precious materials: glass snuff bottles were less expensive and a good imitation passed all but the closest scrutiny. Chinese interest in snuff bottles as collectibles continued into the twentieth century, when delicate, inside-painted wares dominated the market.</P>

<P></P>In the Qing dynasty, the image of a cricket was considered a pun for the word “official,” as the pronunciation of the latter is similar to that for cricket in the Beijing dialect. Therefore, depictions of crickets convey the wish for attaining official ranks.","https://iiif.micr.io/riZLV/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/48941

Snuff Bottle and Stopper,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"<P>Snuff-made of tobacco that is ground into a powdered form and spiced with aromatic substances-was introduced to China from Japan in the late seventeenth century. Chinese elites believed that the powder had medicinal properties, and initially used cylindrical medicine bottles to hold this new ""Japanese tobacco."" Soon after, the Kangxi Emperor (reigned 1662 - 1722)-known for his fondness for snuff and a devoted patron of the arts-established a series of workshops in Beijing to manufacture small, high-quality objects for court use, including snuff bottles. The repertoire of bottle shapes, materials, and motifs dramatically expanded under imperial patronage, and artisans facilitated the dispensing of the tobacco by adding stoppers with attached ivory spoons.</P>

<P>Snuff bottle production reached aesthetic and technological heights during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1736 - 1795), who particularly appreciated the artfulness of the miniature containers. Members of the Qianlong court frequently exchanged the exquisite receptacles as gifts, and by the mid-nineteenth century, snuff bottles had become mandatory items of apparel for Chinese gentlemen and those who aspired to this status. The popularization of these vessels helps account for the many glass bottles produced to resemble jade, agate, quartz, lapis lazuli, and other precious materials: glass snuff bottles were less expensive and a good imitation passed all but the closest scrutiny. Chinese interest in snuff bottles as collectibles continued into the twentieth century, when delicate, inside-painted wares dominated the market.</P>

Snuff Bottle,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"<P>Snuff-made of tobacco that is ground into a powdered form and spiced with aromatic substances-was introduced to China from Japan in the late seventeenth century. Chinese elites believed that the powder had medicinal properties, and initially used cylindrical medicine bottles to hold this new ""Japanese tobacco."" Soon after, the Kangxi Emperor (reigned 1662 - 1722)-known for his fondness for snuff and a devoted patron of the arts-established a series of workshops in Beijing to manufacture small, high-quality objects for court use, including snuff bottles. The repertoire of bottle shapes, materials, and motifs dramatically expanded under imperial patronage, and artisans facilitated the dispensing of the tobacco by adding stoppers with attached ivory spoons.</P>

<P>Snuff bottle production reached aesthetic and technological heights during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1736 - 1795), who particularly appreciated the artfulness of the miniature containers. Members of the Qianlong court frequently exchanged the exquisite receptacles as gifts, and by the mid-nineteenth century, snuff bottles had become mandatory items of apparel for Chinese gentlemen and those who aspired to this status. The popularization of these vessels helps account for the many glass bottles produced to resemble jade, agate, quartz, lapis lazuli, and other precious materials: glass snuff bottles were less expensive and a good imitation passed all but the closest scrutiny. Chinese interest in snuff bottles as collectibles continued into the twentieth century, when delicate, inside-painted wares dominated the market.</P>

<P>This piece may be among the earliest examples of a snuff bottle produced in porcelain and was likely made in the city of Jingdezhen, which has a long history as the center of ceramic production in China.</P>","https://iiif.micr.io/equGx/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/262784
"Dish with Rock, Peonies, Chrysanthemums, and Fungus",Artist/maker unknown,Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),"This heavy, square dish is decorated in yellow and red enamel on both the interior and exterior with blossoming peonies and chrysanthemums growing to either side of a craggy pierced rock, from which two lingzhi fungi emerge. Rocks together with lingzhi fungus comprised a well-known mid-sixteenth-century motif that was often depicted with the <i>shou</i>, or longevity, character, conveying the wish for immortality―a preoccupation of the Jiajing emperor, under whose reign this dish was made. The peony and chrysanthemum are flowers often seen in representations of the four seasons, symbolizing spring and fall, respectively. The existence of other square dishes integrating lingzhi and rocks with the Three Friends of Winter (bamboo, plum, and pine) prompts the question whether the function of these dishes might have been related to the seasons.","https://iiif.micr.io/YjjWd/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/37618

"South Wall, Third Register",Artist/maker unknown,Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220),"The stone carvings collectively known as the Wu Family shrines are a series of organized pictorial elements and inscriptions forming a tomb discovered in China's Shandong province in 1786.  The stone reliefs however have been studied since the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279) through ink rubbings of their surface decoration and inscriptions.  These rubbings were created by placing paper over the surface of the stone and rubbing the paper with ink, transferring the stone texture to paper.  They are a commonly referenced historical source for the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), but they often only selectively represent the stone surface and were in some cases likely altered to depict the ""original"" stone, eroding their reliability.  Scholars now interpret the rubbings both as representations of the stone carving and pictorial traditions of the Han dynasty in which the stones were created, and also as a revealing look at attitudes towards the study of antiquity in the Song dynasty (and later years) in which the rubbings entered the study of history.

Coffered Ceiling from Zhihuasi (Temple of Transforming Wisdom),Artist/maker unknown,Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),"<P>The Zhihua monastery is one of the great Buddhist temple compounds in the Chinese capital of Beijing. Conceived on a grand scale, the compound was built in the early 1400s by the eunuch Wang Zhen. This ceiling comes from the second of five main halls on the monastery's central axis―the Hall of Great Wisdom. </P>

<P>To give visitors a sense of the original context, the Museum installed the ceiling with architectural elements reconstructed from measured drawings made at the original site. In the center is a writhing imperial dragon surrounded by clouds, bracketing, and eight canted panels, each bearing a smaller dragon among clouds. Lotuses, apsaras (Buddhist flying musicians), and other Buddhist religious symbols are carved in the surrounding panels. The Chinese name for this central part of the ceiling is tianjing, or ""well of heaven."" While most of the original red lacquer is well preserved, much of the rich overlay of gold leaf has been lost. </P>

<P>A series of model temples supported by cloud-decorated brackets encompass the central element; within these miniature structures are delicately carved sculptures of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. The remainder of the ceiling consists of square panels painted with stylized lotus flowers that show the influence of Tibetan Buddhism (Lamaism). Each bears a character from a North Indian script (called Lantsha by the Tibetans) that symbolically recreates the universe. The model temples and panels may have been added during repairs made in the Kangxi period (1662C1722).</P>","https://iiif.micr.io/nWGcZ/full/^300,/0/default.jpg",https://www.philamuseum.org/collection/object/44151

"East Wall, Third and Fourth Register",Artist/maker unknown,Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220),"The stone carvings collectively known as the Wu Family shrines are a series of organized pictorial elements and inscriptions forming a tomb discovered in China's Shandong province in 1786.  The stone reliefs however have been studied since the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279) through ink rubbings of their surface decoration and inscriptions.  These rubbings were created by placing paper over the surface of the stone and rubbing the paper with ink, transferring the stone texture to paper.  They are a commonly referenced historical source for the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), but they often only selectively represent the stone surface and were in some cases likely altered to depict the ""original"" stone, eroding their reliability.  Scholars now interpret the rubbings both as representations of the stone carving and pictorial traditions of the Han dynasty in which the stones were created, and also as a revealing look at attitudes towards the study of antiquity in the Song dynasty (and later years) in which the rubbings entered the study of history.

These rubbings were created by placing paper over the surface of the stone and rubbing the paper with ink, transferring the stone texture to paper.  They are a commonly referenced historical source for the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), but they often only selectively represent the stone surface and were in some cases likely altered to depict the ""original"" stone, eroding their reliability.

"Bowl with the Three Friends of Winter (Plum, Bamboo, Pine)",Artist/maker unknown,Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),"With its freely brushed design, painted in modulated tones of deep, inky blue against a glossy white ground, the exterior of this bowl represents a popular Confucian theme: the Three Friends of Winter. The Three Friends―pine, bamboo, and plum―were so named for their shared quality of remaining green during the cold winter months. The hardy pine flourishes in harsh environments and is a symbol of longevity; the tall hollow-jointed bamboo shows strength and resilience in its uprightness yet bends and conforms in adverse conditions; and the plum is the first flower to bloom in late winter, representing perseverance. Together the Three Friends came to epitomize the moral characteristics of integrity and fortitude that a scholar-gentleman was to learn and live by.

<P></P>Situated in the western suburbs of Beijing, the Yuanming Garden, also known as the Garden of Perfect Brightness or the Old Summer Palace, occupies an area of more than eight hundred acres. Construction on this vast site began in 1709 and continued into the next century. In addition to natural sceneries, it features man-made gardens modeled on celebrated examples in southern China, as well as European palaces. The emperors were so fond of this imperial estate that they often took long-term residence in the extensive palaces situated throughout its landscape. This set of printed books is especially valuable in revealing the original elegance and splendor of the Yuanming Garden, which suffered substantial damage by fire and pillaging by foreign troops in 1860 and 1900.

"Rubbing from carved stone from the Wu Family Shrines, ""Fourth Chamber""",Artist/maker unknown,Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE),"The stone carvings collectively known as the Wu Family shrines are a series of organized pictorial elements and inscriptions forming a tomb discovered in China's Shandong province in 1786.

Imperial Poems on Forty Views of the Yuanming Garden (the Old Summer Palace): Record of the Yuanming Garden by the Yongzheng Emperor,Artist/maker unknown,Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),"<P></P>Combining the arts of poetry, landscape painting, architecture and garden design the <i>Imperial Poems on Forty Views of the Yuanming Garden</i>, contain illustrated verses composed by the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736C1795). Each poem is paired with extensive annotations written by eminent scholar-officials that elucidate their meaning as well as images of the site rendered in a European inspired one-point perspective.
<P></P>Situated in the western suburbs of Beijing, the Yuanming Garden, also known as the Garden of Perfect Brightness or the Old Summer Palace, occupies an area of more than eight hundred acres. Construction on this vast site began in 1709 and continued into the next century. In addition to natural sceneries, it features man-made gardens modeled on celebrated examples in southern China, as well as European palaces. The emperors were so fond of this imperial estate that they often took long-term residence in the extensive palaces situated throughout its landscape. This set of printed books is especially valuable in revealing the original elegance and splendor of the Yuanming Garden, which suffered substantial damage by fire and pillaging by foreign troops in 1860 and 1900.
